Mouse TRIP13 and its ortholog Pch2 are instrumental in remodeling HORMA domain proteins. HORMAD proteins are associated with unsynapsed chromosome axes but depleted from the synaptonemal complex (SC) of synapsed homologs.

Localization of TRIP13 to the synapsed SC is independent of SC axial element proteins such as REC8 and SYCP2/SYCP3. Terminal FLAG-tagged TRIP13 proteins are functional and recapitulate the localization of native TRIP13 to SC and telomeres. Therefore, the evolutionarily conserved localization of TRIP13/Pch2 to the synapsed chromosomes provides an explanation for dissociation of HORMA domain proteins upon synapsis in diverse organisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TRIP13</kwd><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>spermatogenesis</kwd><kwd>fertility</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32HD083185</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chotiner</surname><given-names>Jessica Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM153384</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>P Jeremy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mouse TRIP13 localizes to synapsed chromosomal axes and thus exhibits mutually exclusive localization with HORMAD1/HORMAD2, providing a cell biological explanation for dissociation of HORMAD1/2 from chromosomal axes upon synapsis.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Meiosis is a specialized cell division program that generates haploid gametes from diploid germ cells. During meiotic prophase I, homologous chromosomes undergo paring, synapsis, and recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Handel and Schimenti, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zickler and Kleckner, 2015</xref>). Chromosome synapsis requires the formation of the synaptonemal complex (SC). The SC is a proteinaceous structure comprising two lateral/axial elements, transverse filaments, and a central element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Page and Hawley, 2004</xref>). Meiotic recombination begins with the generation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and ends with the crossover formation through repair of DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hunter, 2015</xref>). Chromosome synapsis and meiotic recombination are interdependent in many species, including yeast and mouse. Meiotic recombination not only increases genetic diversity in gametes at the organism level but also is essential for faithful chromosome segregation during the first meiotic cell division. Therefore, defects in meiosis are the leading causes of aneuploidy, birth defect, infertility, and pregnancy loss.</p><p>The progression and completion of synapsis and recombination are monitored by a surveillance mechanism called meiotic checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roeder and Bailis, 2000</xref>). Meiotic checkpoint proteins were extensively studied in yeast. Many meiotic processes are highly conserved, and studies of meiosis in yeast have been foundational for our understanding of mammalian meiosis. In yeast, Pch2, an AAA+ATPase, is a checkpoint protein because it is necessary for pachytene arrest in the absence of the SC protein Zip1 or the meiosis-specific DSB repair protein Dmc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Herruzo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">San-Segundo and Roeder, 1999</xref>). Pch2 is a hexameric ring ATPase and remodels the HORMA (Hop1, Rev7, and MAD2) domain protein Hop1 in a nucleotide-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). While Pch2 is mainly located in the nucleolus, Pch2 also localizes to the synapsed SC as foci at the pachytene stage and is essential for removing Hop1 from chromosome axes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Joshi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">San-Segundo and Roeder, 1999</xref>). Mechanistically, Pch2 promotes phosphorylation of Hop1, which activates the Mek1 kinase and the subsequent checkpoint cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Herruzo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Raina and Vader, 2020</xref>).</p><p>TRIP13, the mammalian ortholog of yeast Pch2, is essential for the completion of meiotic recombination in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li and Schimenti, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roig et al., 2010</xref>). Mutations in human <italic>TRIP13</italic> predispose to Wilms tumor in children or cause infertility in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yost et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). HORMAD1 and HORMAD2, mammalian meiosis-specific HORMA domain proteins, localize to chromosome axis at leptotene and zygotene stages but are depleted from synapsed chromosomes, except the largely unsynapsed XY chromosomes at the pachytene stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cossu et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fukuda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). TRIP13 facilitates removal of HORMAD proteins from synapsed chromosome axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roig et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wojtasz et al., 2009</xref>). SKP1, an essential component of the SCF (Skp1-Cullin 1-F-box protein) ubiquitin E3 ligase, is required not only for depleting HORMAD1 and HORMAD2 from synapsed chromosome axes but also for restricting the accumulation of HORMAD proteins on unsynapsed axes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guan et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, reorganization of HORMA domain proteins on meiotic chromosome axes is regulated by both TRIP13 and SKP1. As a conserved mechanism, Pch2/TRIP13 remodels HORMA domain proteins through engagement of their N-terminal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Prince and Martinez-Perez, 2022</xref>). MAD2, a spindle assembly checkpoint HORMA domain protein, exists in two fold states: closed and open (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sironi et al., 2002</xref>). In the closed state, the so-called safety belt of the HORMA domain wraps around the HORMAD protein-binding motif ‘closure motif’ in the partner protein and thus traps the partner. In the open state, TRIP13 engagement changes conformation of the HORMA domain, resulting in foldback of the safety belt on the closure motif-binding region and thus release of its partner protein. The safety belt mechanism turns out to be a shared feature of HORMA domain proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">West et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">West et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ye et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Unlike yeast Pch2, TRIP13 does not appear to function in the meiotic checkpoint in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pacheco et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, HORMAD2 functions as a meiotic checkpoint protein for surveillance of meiotic defects in female meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kogo et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rinaldi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wojtasz et al., 2012</xref>). HORMAD2-deficient males are sterile but females are fertile. HORMAD2 deficiency rescues the oocyte loss in <italic>Spo11</italic>-null or <italic>Trip13</italic> mutant females but not in <italic>Dmc1</italic>-null females, suggesting that HORMAD2 is a component of the meiotic checkpoint in females. HORMAD1 is required for fertility in both sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kogo et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stanzione et al., 2016</xref>). Both HORMAD1 and HORMAD2 localize prominently to the XY chromosome axes in pachytene spermatocytes and regulate meiotic sex chromatin inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kogo et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wojtasz et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Studies of mice with hypomorphic <italic>Trip13</italic> mutations show that TRIP13 is required for meiotic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li and Schimenti, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roig et al., 2010</xref>). Two different hypomorphic <italic>Trip13</italic> mouse lines have been studied: one ‘moderate’ allele that exhibited defective meiotic recombination and one ‘severe’ allele that displayed defects in meiotic recombination and chromosome synapsis. The variance in phenotype between the hypomorphic mouse lines indicates that even partial depletion of <italic>Trip13</italic> can interrupt meiosis. We sought to further investigate the meiotic function of TRIP13. By immunofluorescence, we found that TRIP13 localized to the SC in early pachytene spermatocytes and to telomeres throughout meiotic prophase I. The TRIP13 localization pattern on meiotic chromosomes was further confirmed by the analysis of FLAG-tagged TRIP13 in two knockin mouse lines. To determine the effect of complete loss of TRIP13, we characterized <italic>Trip13</italic>-null mice. While the <italic>Trip13</italic>-null phenotype was largely comparable to the phenotype of the severe <italic>Trip13</italic> hypomorphic allele, we found that TRIP13 is a dosage-sensitive regulator of meiosis. Finally, our results show that the localization of TRIP13 to the SC is independent of axial element proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TRIP13 localizes to meiotic chromosomes in prophase I spermatocytes</title><p>We assessed the expression of TRIP13 in a panel of adult mouse tissues. TRIP13 was primarily expressed in testis but detected at low levels in ovary and liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In the testis, TRIP13 was prominent in the cytoplasm of primary spermatocytes, especially leptotene and zygotene cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Given the expression of TRIP13 in spermatocytes, we examined its localization on meiotic chromosomes by immunostaining of surface spread nuclei of prophase I spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Previously, TRIP13 was reported to localize to telomeres in spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gómez-H et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, we found that TRIP13 localized to telomeres from leptotene to diplotene cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Strikingly, we found that, in addition to telomeres, TRIP13 localized to the SC in early pachytene spermatocytes but disappeared from the SC in the mid to late pachytene spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The SC consists of two lateral elements and one central element. The central region comprises the transverse filament protein SYCP1 and central element proteins, which appear upon synapsis. Given the novel localization of TRIP13 to the SC, we performed confocal immunofluorescent microscopy with super-resolution deconvolution to determine the location of TRIP13 within the SC. In contrast to the lateral element marker SYCP3, TRIP13 localized to the SC central region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We examined the localization of TRIP13 in oocytes. TRIP13 localized strongly to meiotic telomeres in all stages of prophase I, but not as filaments on the SC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These findings are consistent with the genetic requirement of TRIP13 in meiosis in both sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li and Schimenti, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roig et al., 2010</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>TRIP13 localizes to the synaptonemal complex and telomeres in spermatocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot analysis of TRIP13 in adult mouse tissues.

However, while the <italic>Trip13</italic> moderate allele showed mostly intact chromosomal synapsis, the severe allele displayed chromosomal unsynapsis preferentially at chromosome ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li and Schimenti, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roig et al., 2010</xref>). Upon close examination, we also found unsynapsed ends in spermatocytes with the moderate <italic>Trip13</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guan et al., 2020</xref>). To rigorously ascertain the role of TRIP13 in meiosis, we generated <italic>Trip13</italic>-null mutants using frozen sperm from <italic>Trip13</italic><sup>+/-</sup> males with a knockout allele from the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium. The mouse <italic>Trip13</italic> gene consists of 13 exons. This new <italic>Trip13</italic> mutant allele harbors a deletion of a 24 kb region including all 13 exons and thus is expected to be null. We verified this deletion by PCR and sequencing. Interbreeding of <italic>Trip13</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice produced fewer <italic>Trip13</italic><sup>-/-</sup> offspring than expected: <italic>Trip13</italic><sup>+/+</sup>, 80; <italic>Trip13</italic><sup>+/-</sup>, 220; <italic>Trip13</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, 51 (χ<sup>2</sup> = 27, p=0.0001). The body weight of 2–3-month-old males was not significantly different between wild type (24.3 ± 2.8 g, n = 5) and <italic>Trip13</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (22.8 ± 1.7 g, n = 5, p=0.3, Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test). The <italic>Trip13</italic><sup>-/-</sup> testis was much smaller than <italic>Trip13</italic><sup>+/-</sup> testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Western blot analysis showed that TRIP13 was present in reduced abundance in <italic>Trip13</italic><sup>+/-</sup> testis and not detected in <italic>Trip13</italic><sup>-/-</sup> testis, demonstrating that this mutant allele is null (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The abundance of SYCP3, a component of the SC, was also reduced in <italic>Trip13</italic><sup>-/-</sup> testis, suggesting a partial depletion of meiotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The testis weight of adult <italic>Trip13</italic><sup>-/-</sup> males was reduced by 74% in comparison with the wild type males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Adult <italic>Trip13</italic><sup>-/-</sup> males lacked sperm in the epididymis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

In meiocytes, HORMA domain proteins are associated with unsynapsed chromosome axes and become depleted from the SC upon synapsis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). In mice with <italic>Trip13</italic> hypomorphic gene trap alleles, HORMAD1 and HORMAD2 persist on the synapsed SCs at the pachytene stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wojtasz et al., 2009</xref>). In this study, we confirmed the abnormal persistence of HORMAD1 and HORMAD2 in <italic>Trip13</italic>-null spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). In budding yeast, deficiency of Pch2 leads to the accumulation of Hop1 on the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Joshi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Subramanian et al., 2016</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, Pch2 remodels the HORMA domain protein ASY1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balboni et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). Pch2 has been shown to localize to synapsed SC in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Joshi et al., 2009</xref>), <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deshong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Russo et al., 2023</xref>), <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lambing et al., 2015</xref>), and rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miao et al., 2013</xref>), but not in mice. In mouse meiocytes, TRIP13 was known to localize to telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gómez-H et al., 2019</xref>). In addition to telomeres, we find that TRIP13 localizes to the SC in early pachytene spermatocytes in mice. In particular, TRIP13 localizes as a single filament between the SC lateral elements. Therefore, TRIP13/Pch2 and HORMA domain proteins have mutually exclusive localization patterns on the meiotic chromosome axes, providing an explanation for the depletion of HORMA domain proteins from the synapsed chromosomes in diverse organisms.</p><p>The transverse filaments (TFs) are essential for the recruitment of Pch2 to the SC. In a budding yeast Zip1 (encoding the TF component) allele with four amino acid substitutions, Pch2 is absent from the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Subramanian et al., 2016</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the TF component SYP-1 is essential for localization of Pch-2 on the paired chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deshong et al., 2014</xref>). In rice, CRC1 (Pch2 ortholog) and CEP1 (TF protein) localize to the SC in an inter-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miao et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, ZYP1 (TF component) recruits Pch2 to the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). In the yeast two-hybrid assay, rice CRC1 interacts with CEP1, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ZYP1 interacts with Pch2, and mouse SYCP1 (TF protein) interacts with TRIP13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). Unlike in other species, loss of SYCP1 (TF protein) in mouse leads to a complete failure in chromosomal synapsis and thus its role in the recruitment of TRIP13 to the synapsed SC cannot be directly addressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Vries et al., 2005</xref>). Our findings on the localization of mouse TRIP13 to the SC on the sister chromatids in <italic>Rec8</italic>-deficient spermatocytes and the short SC stretches in <italic>Sycp2</italic> mutant spermatocytes demonstrate that TRIP13 recruitment is independent of SC axial element proteins REC8 and SYCP2 but support the possibility that SYCP1 could recruit TRIP13 to the synapsed SC. These findings lead to the following model: the TF protein recruits Pch2/TRIP13 to the SC upon synapsis, which in turn evicts HORMA domain proteins from the synapsed regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><p>Both TRIP13 and SKP1 are required for the removal of HORMA domain proteins from the synapsed SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wojtasz et al., 2009</xref>). However, the relationship of TRIP13 and SKP1 is unknown. SKP1 localizes to the synapsed SC more extensively than TRIP13. While TRIP13 is only detected on the synapsed SC in early pachytene spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), SKP1 localizes to the synapsed SC in zygotene, all stages of pachytene, and diplotene spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guan et al., 2020</xref>). The localization of TRIP13 and SKP1 within the SC is different: TRIP13 is on CE/TF regions but SKP1 on LEs. While the global level of TRIP13 is reduced in <italic>Skp1</italic>-deficient testes, the localization of TRIP13 and SKP1 to the synapsed SC is independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guan et al., 2020</xref>). The SCF ubiquitin E3 ligase complex targets HORMAD1 for ubiquitination and degradation in transfected HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guan et al., 2022</xref>). Loss of TRIP13 leads to the accumulation of HORMAD proteins only to the synapsed SC in pachytene cells. In contrast, depletion of SKP1 causes accumulation of HORMA domain proteins, particularly HORMAD1, on both unsynapsed and synapsed chromosome axes from leptotene through diplotene meiocytes. Therefore, TRIP13 and SKP1 might regulate different pools of HORMAD proteins in meiocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><p>In many organisms, including mouse and human, centromeres are the last regions to synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bisig et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Qiao et al., 2012</xref>). The reason for this is unknown, but it might be related to the necessity to suppress deleterious non-homologous recombination at centromere and pericentromeric regions, which consist of minor and major satellite repeats, respectively. The centromere was proposed to exert an inhibitory effect on synapsis in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 2005</xref>). The inhibition needs to be relieved to achieve full synapsis since unsynapsis at centromeres is expected to trigger the meiotic checkpoint, leading to meiotic arrest. To date, only two mouse mutants (<italic>Skp1</italic> and <italic>Trip13</italic>) exhibit unsynapsis preferentially at the centromeric end in pachytene-like cells. In addition, only these two mouse mutants display abnormal accumulation of HORMAD proteins on the synapsed SC. Intriguingly, TRIP13 localizes to telomeres in both spermatocytes and oocytes. The centromere is close to one of the telomeres in mouse. Thus, the preferential centromeric end asynapsis in <italic>Trip13</italic> or <italic>Skp1</italic>-deficient meiocytes could be related to the abnormal persistence of HORMAD proteins. However, the underlying molecular mechanism warrants further investigation.</p><p>We find that TRIP13 is a dosage-dependent regulator of meiosis. The <italic>Trip13</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice displayed reduced testis weight, reduced sperm count, and meiotic defects but these defects were less severe than the <italic>Trip13</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. The disease phenotypes in humans also appear to be influenced by the <italic>TRIP13</italic> dosage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yost et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). The dosage-dependent phenotypic variation has been reported in other mouse meiotic mutants such as <italic>Tex11</italic>, <italic>Meiob</italic>, and <italic>Rnf212</italic>. TEX11 localizes to meiotic chromosomes as foci and regulates crossover formation and chromosome synapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2008</xref>). The TEX11 protein levels correlate with genome-wide recombination rates in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). MEIOB, a meiosis-specific ssDNA-binding protein, is essential for meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Luo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Souquet et al., 2013</xref>). In mice with different combinations of <italic>Meiob</italic> alleles, MEIOB protein levels directly correlate with the severity of meiotic defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guo et al., 2020</xref>). Sequence variants in human RNF212 are associated with variations in genome-wide recombination rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chowdhury et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kong et al., 2008</xref>). In mouse, RNF212 forms foci on meiotic chromosomes and regulates crossover formation in a dosage-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reynolds et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, dosage sensitivity appears to be a common feature of many regulators of meiosis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Trip13</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GenBank</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene ID: 69716</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Trip13</italic><sup>tm1.1(KOMP)Vlcg/JMmucd</sup></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MMRCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MMRRC_050223-UCD</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Hormad1</italic> knockout</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21079677/">21079677</ext-link>;

id="s4-3"><title>Generation of 3×FLAG-<italic>Trip13</italic> and <italic>Trip13</italic>-3×FLAG knockin mouse strains</title><p>The 3×FLAG-knockin mouse strains were generated using the CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing approach. To generate N-terminally tagged knockin mice, one single-guide RNA (sgRNA) was designed to target the first exon of the mouse <italic>Trip13</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). An ssDNA repair template was created using the sequence surrounding the start codon as 5′ and 3′ homology arms. The knockin template itself included the sequence for the 3×FLAG epitope and a three-residue linker sequence. The C-terminally tagged strain was generated similarly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The guide RNA targeted exon 13 containing the stop codon. The ssDNA template contained the FLAG-encoding sequences and homology sequences flanking the insertion site. The sgRNA sequences and ssDNA template sequences are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>.</p><p>For the sgRNA, the oligo was phosphorylated, annealed, and cloned to PX330 plasmid (Addgene, Waterton, MA). After in vitro transcription with the MEGAshortscript T7 Kit (AM1354, Invitrogen) and purification with the MEGAclear Transcription Clean-Up Kit (AM1908, Invitrogen), a mixture of Cas9 mRNA (100 ng/µl; Trilink, Cat# L-7206 + 0.5 µl of the sgRNA [35 ng/µl] + 100 ng/ul of ssDNA template) was prepared and injected into zygotes. The injected zygotes were cultured in KSOM medium at 37°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator until the two-cell stage. The two-cell embryos were transferred into oviducts of 0.5-day post-coitum pseudopregnant ICR foster mothers. Founder mice were bred to wild type mice to obtain germline transmission. The N-terminal 3×FLAG allele and the C-terminal 3×FLAG allele were PCR amplified and sequenced to confirm the insertion. PCR genotyping primers are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Production of anti-MAJIN antibodies</title><p>The short isoform of mouse MAJIN (amino acids 1–124; XM_036161650.1 and XP_036017543.1) was expressed as a 6xHis-MAJIN recombinant protein in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> using the pQE-30 vector. The recombinant protein was affinity purified with the Ni-NTA agarose. Two guinea pigs were immunized at Cocalico Biologicals Inc (Reamstown, PA), resulting in two antisera (UP-GP140 and UP-GP141). Both anti-sera were used for immunofluorescence of nuclear spreads of spermatocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Histological, immunofluorescence, and surface nuclear spread analyses</title><p>For histology, testes or ovaries were fixed in Bouin’s solution at room temperature overnight, embedded with paraffin, and sectioned at 8 μm. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For immunofluorescence analysis, testes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (in 1× PBS) overnight at 4°C, dehydrated in 30% sucrose (in 1× PBS) overnight, and sectioned at 8 μm in a cryostat. Surface nuclear spread analysis was described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Peters et al., 1997</xref>). Briefly, testicular tubules or ovarian tissues were soaked in hypotonic treatment buffer (30 mM Tris, 50 mM sucrose, 17 mM trisodium citrate dihydrate, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF). Then the cells were suspended in 100 mM sucrose and spread by physical disruption on PTFE printed slides that were previously soaked with paraformaldehyde solution containing Triton X-100 and sodium borate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Imaging</title><p>Histological images were captured on the Leica DM5500B microscope with a DFC450 digital camera (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Most immunolabeled chromosome spread images were taken on the Leica DM5500B microscope with an ORCA Flash4.0 digital monochrome camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Bridgewater, NJ). Confocal microscopy of immunolabeled chromosome spreads was performed on a Leica SP5 II confocal (Leica Microsystems) with an ×100 (1.46 NA) oil immersion objective lens. Images were deconvolved with Huygens Essential deconvolution software (Scientific Volume Imaging B.V., Hilversum, Netherlands).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Testes

All the meiotic defects in our Trip13-null mice were also present in Trip13 severe hypermorph mutants: meiotic arrest, defects in chromosomal synapsis, asynapsis at chromosomal ends, and accumulation of HORMAD1/2 on the SC axis. Therefore, the defects in meiotic recombination in Trip13-null mice are expected to be similar to those in Trip13 severe hypermorph mutants and thus we did not examine the proteins involved in meiotic recombination in the Trip13-null mutant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors perform a thorough examination of the phenotypes of a newly generated Trip13 null allele in mice, noting defects in chromosome synapsis and impact on localization of other key proteins (namely HORMADs) on meiotic chromosomes. The vast majority of data confirms observations of several prior studies of Trip13 alleles (moderate and severe hypomorphs). The original or primary aims of the study aren't clear, but it can be assumed that the authors wanted to better study the role of this protein in evicting HORMADs upon synapsis by studying phenotypes of mutants and better characterizing TRIP13 localization data (which they find localizes to the central element of synapsed chromosomes using a new epitope-tagged allele). Their data confirm prior reports and are consistent with localization data of the orthologous Pch2 protein in many other organisms.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The quality of data is high. Probably the most important data the authors find is that TRIP13 is localized along the CE of synapsed chromosomes. However, this was not unexpected because PCH2 is also similarly localized. Also, the authors use a clear null (deletion allele), whereas prior studies used hypomorphs.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>There is limited new data; most are confirmatory or expected (i.e., SC localization), and thus the impact of this report is not high. The claim that TRIP13 &quot;functions as a dosage-sensitive regulator of meiosis&quot; is exaggerated in my opinion. Indeed, the authors make the observation that hets have a phenotype, but numerous genes have haploinsufficient phenotypes. In my opinion, it is a leap to extrapolate this to infer that TRIP13 is a &quot;regulator&quot; of meiosis. What is the definition of a meiosis regulator? Is it at the apex of the meiosis process, or is it a crucial cog of any aspect of meiosis?</p></disp-quote><p>TRIP13 is not haploinsufficient, as Trip13 heterozygotes were still viable and fertile (albeit with defects in meiosis). TRIP13 is an ATPase and changes the conformation of meiosis-specific proteins such as HORMAD proteins. TRIP13 is essential for meiosis and its mutations cause defects in both meiotic recombination and chromosomal synapsis. Reviewer 1 stated that “TRIP13/Pch2 is a conserved essential regulator of meiotic recombination from yeast to humans”. Therefore, we feel that TRIP13 can be called a regulator of meiosis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>A schematic illustration of SC structure, the components involved, and the main finding, would be helpful for readers to better understand the advancement made by this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added a schematic illustration in a new panel - Figure 7C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig. 1B, the stage with diplotene cells should be XII.</p></disp-quote><p>The pachytene cells (Pac) were mis-labelled as diplotene cells.

I support the publication of this study. I have some suggestions to improve and polish the manuscript.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>(1) The heterozygous phenotypes demonstrate that TRIP13 is a dosage-sensitive regulator of meiosis. In relation to this conclusion, as summarized in the discussion section, other mutants defective in meiotic recombination showed dosage-sensitive phenotypes. Given the function of HORMAD1 in meiotic recombination, it would be informative if the authors could examine how major makers of meiotic recombination behave in Trip13-null meiosis.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to Weaknesses from Reviewer #2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Relating to the above point, the complete lack of synapsis on the sex chromosomes in the Trip13-null meiosis is impressive. This result raises a question as to whether the pathway to designate XY-obligatory crossover (which can be detected with large foci of ANKRD31 and MEI4/REC114 at PAR) is affected or not. It would be interesting to examine whether the ANKRD31 and MEI4/REC114 foci are present on PAR in Trip13-null meiosis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed immunofluorescent analysis of REC114 in spermatocytes. In Trip13-null pachytene-like spermatocytes, X and Y chromosomes are not synapsed. REC114 still formed one focus each on the unsynapsed X and Y chromosomes. We have added this new data in the Results as a new supplementary figure (Figure 4 -supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 4 can be improved if there are quantified data for each phenotype. These phenotypes look nearly complete, but it would be informative to show the penetrance of these phenotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>Because some chromosomes have unsynapsed ends, resulting in two centromere or telomere foci, the total number of centromere or telomere foci is always higher in Trip13-null pachytene-like spermatocytes than wild type pachytene spermatocytes. Therefore, we did not count the foci of centromeres and telomeres. Consistently, the centromere and telomere markers localized as expected in both wild type and Trip13-null spermatocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) I am not fully convinced by these photos: &quot;synapsed sister chromatids (Figure 6B)&quot; and &quot;Sycp2-/- spermatocytes formed short stretches of synapsis (Figure 6C)&quot;. The authors may try confocal microscopy with super-resolution deconvolution as they did for other data.</p></disp-quote><p>These have been previously demonstrated. The “synapsed sister chromatids (Figure 6B)” were previously demonstrated by confocal microscopy with super-resolution deconvolution (Guan et al., 2020). The short stretches of synapsis in Sycp2-/- spermatocytes was previously demonstrated by electron microscopy (Tripartite SC structure) and SYCP1 immunofluorescence (Yang et al., 2006). We have revised the text by citing the previous evidence and the publications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>(1) Line 19-21: &quot;Loss of TRIP13 leads to meiotic arrest and thus sterility in both sexes. Trip13-null meiocytes exhibit abnormal persistence of HORMAD1 and HOMRAD2 on synapsed SC&quot;. These findings confirm the previously reported phenotypes of the Trip13 hypomorph alleles. This information can be added to the abstract. Otherwise, it sounds like these are totally new findings, as written.</p></disp-quote><p>This information is now added to the abstract: “These findings confirm the previously reported phenotypes of the Trip13 hypomorph alleles.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The introduction section seems too long and contains unnecessary information. Some molecular details that are not touched in the result section can be deleted (e.g., Line 65-73).</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to keep the molecular details on the two conformation states, as it provides biochemical background on TRIP13-HORMAD interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Introduction, Line 92.

The authors might look at more comprehensive RNA-seq data from mice and humans.</p></disp-quote><p>We examined TRIP13 protein expression in 8 mouse tissues by WB and found that TRIP13 protein was abundant in testis but present at a very low level in ovary and liver (Figure 1A). We feel that readers can easily look up the relative transcript levels of Trip13 in more tissues from mice and humans from NCBI database under “Gene”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The null allele is semi-lethal. Is body size affected? Were the mice abnormal in any other ways, given that TRIP13 has been implicated in other diseases and processes, and is expressed in other tissues (TRIP13 stands for Thyroid receptor interacting protein).</p></disp-quote><p>The body weight of 2-3 month-old males was not significantly different between wild type (24.3±2.8 g, n=5) and Trip13 KO mice (22.8±1.7 g, n=5, p=0.3, Student’s t-Test). We have included the body weight information in the revised manuscript. We didn’t observe abnormal somatic defects in the viable Trip13-null mice, nor did the authors report any in the Trip13 hypomorph mutants in two previous studies (Li and Schimenti, 2007; Roig et al., 2010).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Line 276 : It would be nice to elaborate on the &quot;spatial explanation.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We meant that TRIP13 localizes to SC while HORMAD proteins are removed from SC upon chromosomal synapsis, thus providing a spatial explanation.
