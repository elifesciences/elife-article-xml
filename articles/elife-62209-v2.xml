An early study reported high-frequency somatic mutations affecting UPF1, a nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) factor, in PASC, but subsequent studies did not observe these lesions. The corresponding controversy about whether <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations are important contributors to PASC has been exacerbated by a paucity of functional studies. Here, we modeled two <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations in human and mouse cells to find no significant effects on pancreatic cancer growth, acquisition of adenosquamous features, <italic>UPF1</italic> splicing, UPF1 protein, or NMD efficiency. We subsequently discovered that 45% of <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations reportedly present in PASCs are identical to standing genetic variants in the human population, suggesting that they may be non-pathogenic inherited variants rather than pathogenic mutations. Our data suggest that <italic>UPF1</italic> is not a common functional driver of PASC and motivate further attempts to understand the genetic origins of these malignancies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cancer is a group of complex diseases in which cells grow uncontrollably and spread into surrounding tissues and other parts of the body. All types of cancers develop from changes – or mutations – in the genes that affect the pathways involved in controlling the growth of cells.</p><p>Different cancers possess unique sets of mutations that affect specific genes, and often, it is difficult to determine which of them play the most important role in a particular type of cancer. For example, pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma, a rare and aggressive form of pancreatic cancer, is a devastating disease with a poor chance of survival – patients rarely live longer than one year after diagnosis.</p><p>While the cells of this particular cancer display distinct features that separate them from other forms of pancreatic cancer, the genetic causes of these features are unclear. Using new technologies, some researchers have reported mutations in a ‘quality control’ gene called ‘<italic>UPF1</italic>’, which is responsible for destroying faulty forms of genetic material. However, subsequent studies did not find such mutations.</p><p>To clarify the role of <italic>UPF1</italic> in pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma, Polaski et al. used mouse and human cancer cells with <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations and monitored their effects on tumour growth and the development of features unique to this disease.</p><p>Polaski et al. first injected mice with mouse pancreatic cancer cells containing mutations in <italic>UPF1</italic> (mutated cells) and cancer cells without. Both groups of mice developed pancreatic tumours but there was no difference in tumour growth between the mutated and non-mutated cells, and neither cell type displayed distinct features. The researchers then generated human mutated cells, which were also found to lack any specific characteristics. Further analysis showed that the mutations did not stop <italic>UPF1</italic> from working, in fact, over 40% of these mutations occurred naturally in humans without causing cancer.</p><p>This suggests that <italic>UPF1</italic> does not seem to be involved in pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma. Further investigation is needed to illuminate key genetic players in the development of this type of cancer, which will be vital for improving treatments and outcomes for patients suffering from this disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pancreatic cancer</kwd><kwd>cancer genomics</kwd><kwd>cancer genetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 CA009657</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Polaski</surname><given-names>Jacob T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007270</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Udy</surname><given-names>Dylan B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 CA160001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kannan</surname><given-names>Ram</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 CA204228</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leach</surname><given-names>Steven D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005189</institution-id><institution>Leukemia and Lymphoma Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1344-18</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bradley</surname><given-names>Robert K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value><italic>UPF1</italic> mutations were reportedly present at high frequencies in a cohort of pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma patients, but these lesions are unlikely to be functional drivers of this cancer subtype.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma (PASC) is a rare and aggressive disease that constitutes 1–4% of pancreatic exocrine tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Madura et al., 1999</xref>). Patient prognosis is extremely poor, with a median survival of 8 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Simone et al., 2013</xref>). Although PASC is clinically and histologically distinct from the more common disease pancreatic adenocarcinoma, the genetic and molecular origins of PASC’s unique features are unknown.</p><p>A recent study reported a potential breakthrough in our understanding of PASC etiology. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2014</xref> reported high-frequency mutations affecting <italic>UPF1</italic>, which encodes a core component of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway, in 78% (18 of 23) of PASC patients. These mutations were absent from patient-matched normal pancreatic tissue (0 of 18) and from non-PASC tumors (0 of 29 non-adenosquamous pancreatic carcinomas and 0 of 21 lung squamous cell carcinomas). The authors used a combination of molecular and histological assays to find that the <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations caused <italic>UPF1</italic> mis-splicing, loss of UPF1 protein, and impaired NMD, resulting in stable expression of aberrant mRNAs containing premature termination codons that would normally be degraded by NMD. The recurrent, PASC-specific, and focal nature of the reported <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations, together with their dramatic effects on NMD activity, suggested that <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations are a key feature of PASC biology.</p><p>Three subsequent studies of distinct PASC cohorts, however, did not report somatic mutations in <italic>UPF1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hayashi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Witkiewicz et al., 2015</xref>). This absence of <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations is significantly different from the high rate reported by Liu et al. (0 of 34 total PASC samples from three cohorts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hayashi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Witkiewicz et al., 2015</xref>] vs. 18 of 23 PASC samples from Liu et al; p&lt;10<sup>−8</sup> by the two-sided binomial proportion test). Although these other studies relied on whole-exome and/or genome sequencing instead of targeted <italic>UPF1</italic> gene sequencing, those technologies yield good coverage of the relevant <italic>UPF1</italic> gene regions because the affected introns are very short. Given this discrepancy, we sought to directly assess the functional contribution of <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations to PASC using a combination of biological and molecular assays.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We first tested the role of the reported <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations during tumorigenesis in vivo. Liu et al. reported that the majority of <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations caused skipping of <italic>UPF1</italic> exons 10 and 11, disrupting UPF1’s RNA helicase domain that is essential for its NMD activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore modeled <italic>UPF1</italic> mutation-induced exon skipping by designing paired guide RNAs flanking <italic>Upf1</italic> exons 10 and 11, such that these exons would be deleted upon Cas9 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We chose mouse pancreatic cancer cells (KPC cells: <italic>Kras</italic><sup>G12D</sup>; <italic>Trp53</italic><sup>R172H/null</sup>; Pdx1-Cre) as a model system. KPC cells are defined by mutations affecting KRAS and p53 (encoded by <italic>Kras</italic> and <italic>Trp53</italic> in mouse) that also occur in the vast majority of PASC cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borazanci et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hayashi et al., 2020</xref>), making them a genetically appropriate system. We delivered <italic>Upf1</italic>-targeting paired guide RNAs to KPC cells using recombinant adenoviral vectors and confirmed that guide delivery resulted in the production of <italic>UPF1</italic> mRNA lacking exons 10 and 11 and a corresponding reduction in full-length UPF1 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–G</xref>). We injected subcloned control and <italic>Upf1</italic>-targeted KPC cells into the tails of the pancreata of B6 albino mice (n = 10 mice per treatment) and monitored tumor growth and animal survival. We detected no significant differences in tumor volume or survival in mice implanted with control or <italic>Upf1</italic>-targeted KPC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source datas 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">2</xref>). Tumors derived from control as well as <italic>Upf1</italic>-targeted cells displayed similar histopathological features characteristic of moderately to poorly differentiated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>). Moderately differentiated areas were composed of medium to small duct-like structures or tubules with lower mucin production, while poorly differentiated components were characterized by solid sheets or nests of tumor cells with large eosinophilic cytoplasms and large pleomorphic nuclei. No squamous differentiation was identified by histomorphologic evaluation and no expression of the squamous marker p40 (ΔNp63) was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). We concluded that inducing the reported <italic>Upf1</italic> exon skipping in vivo had no detectable effects on pancreatic cancer growth or acquisition of adenosquamous features in the KPC model. However, there are several important caveats to our data. First, we cannot rule out the possibility that inducing <italic>Upf1</italic> exon skipping in a different model system or cell type could influence tumorigenesis. Second, as our assays were performed in the complex setting of in vivo tumorigenesis, we cannot infer how inducing the reported <italic>Upf1</italic> exon skipping might affect tumor cell proliferation in the controlled setting of in vitro growth. Third, as accurate measurement of <italic>Upf1</italic> spicing and UPF1 protein isoforms was only possible for KPC cells prior to orthotopic injection, we cannot infer how the relative frequencies of mis-spliced <italic>UPF1</italic> mRNA and the resulting truncated proteins may have changed during tumorigenesis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>UPF1</italic> mutations do not result in the acquisition of squamous histological features or confer a growth advantage to mutant cells in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of <italic>UPF1</italic> gene structure and corresponding encoded protein domains.

Liu et al. measured the effects of each mutation on <italic>UPF1</italic> splicing using a minigene assay, in which each mutation was introduced into a plasmid containing a small fragment of the <italic>UPF1</italic> gene that was subsequently transfected into 293 T cells. Liu et al. concluded that all reported <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations caused dramatic <italic>UPF1</italic> mis-splicing that disrupted key protein domains that are essential for UPF1 function in NMD. Minigenes are common tools for studying splicing, but they are frequently spliced less efficiently than endogenous genes, presumably because they are gene fragments that lack potentially important sequence features that promote splicing and incompletely capture the close relationship between chromatin and splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Luco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Naftelberg et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We modeled <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations in 293 T cells in order to mimic Liu et al.’s experimental strategy, but introduced mutations into their endogenous genomic contexts rather than using minigenes. We selected two distinct <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations in intron 10 for these studies. We selected IVS10+31G&gt;A (patient 1; P1) because it was reportedly recurrent across three different patients (making it equally or more common than any other mutation) and induced strong mis-splicing on its own (36% mis-spliced mRNA, versus 0% for wild-type <italic>UPF1</italic>); we selected IVS10-17G&gt;A (patient 9; P9) because it had one of the strongest effects on splicing (90% mis-spliced mRNA). IVS10+31G&gt;A was present in a homozygous state in two of the three patients carrying it, while IVS10-17G&gt;A was present in a heterozygous state.</p><p>We introduced each mutation into its endogenous context by transiently transfecting a plasmid expressing Cas9 and a single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting <italic>UPF1</italic> intron 10 as well as appropriate donor DNA for homology-directed repair, screened the resulting cells for the desired genotypes, and established clonal lines. The resulting cell lines contained the desired mutations in the correct copy numbers as well as a point mutation disrupting the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). As neither the PAM site itself nor nearby positions were reported as mutated in Liu et al., we additionally established a cell line in which only the PAM site was mutated as a wild-type control.</p><p>We systematically tested the functional consequences of <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations for NMD efficiency, UPF1 protein levels, and <italic>UPF1</italic> splicing. We measured NMD efficiency in our engineered cells using the well-established beta-globin reporter system, which permits controlled measurement of the relative levels of mRNAs that do or do not contain an NMD-inducing premature termination codon, but which are otherwise identical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>). We did not observe decreased NMD efficiency in <italic>UPF1</italic>-mutant versus wild-type cells; instead, <italic>UPF1</italic>-mutant cells exhibited evidence of modestly more efficient NMD, although these differences were not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). To confirm these results from reporter experiments, we then queried levels of endogenous NMD substrates across the transcriptome. We performed high-coverage RNA-seq on each of the three 293 T cell lines that we engineered to lack or contain defined <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations in biological triplicate, quantified transcript expression, and identified differentially expressed transcripts. We focused on NMD substrates arising from alternative splicing, as these are abundant and sensitive biomarkers of NMD efficiency that are internally controlled for gene expression variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Feng et al., 2015</xref>). These analyses revealed that neither <italic>UPF1</italic>-mutant cell line exhibited global increases in the expression of NMD substrates relative to wild-type cells. Instead, both <italic>UPF1</italic>-mutant cell lines exhibited modestly lower global levels of endogenous NMD substrates than did wild-type cells, mimicking the trend observed with our NMD reporter experiments.

We searched for each mutation reported by Liu et al. within databases compiled by the 1000 Genomes Project, NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC), and the genome aggregation database (gnomAD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Auton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Karczewski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Exome Aggregation Consortium et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Server EV, 2016</xref>).

First, when strongly cancer-linked mutations occur as germline variants, they frequently manifest as cancer predisposition syndromes. However, no such relationship is known for <italic>UPF1</italic> genetic variants, despite their reportedly high prevalence as identical somatic mutations in PASC. Second, <italic>UPF1</italic> is essential for embryonic viability and development in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Medghalchi et al., 2001</xref>), zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wittkopp et al., 2009</xref>), and Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avery et al., 2011</xref>). As Liu et al. reported that all <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations caused mis-splicing that is expected to disable UPF1 protein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2014</xref>), then those mutations should be incompatible with life when present as inherited genetic variants. Our finding that two reported mutations had no effect on <italic>UPF1</italic> splicing when introduced into their endogenous genomic contexts offers a way to explain this incongruity, at least for the two reported lesions that we studied.</p><p>Given these discrepancies, we next sought to verify the somatic nature of the <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations described in Liu et al., which was reportedly determined by sequencing both tumors and patient-matched controls. The GenBank accession codes reported in Liu et al. corresponded to short nucleotide sequences containing <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations, without corresponding data for patient-matched controls. We contacted the senior author (Dr. YanJun Lu) to request primary sequencing data from patient-matched tumor and normal samples, but neither primary sequencing data from matched samples nor the samples themselves were available.</p><p>To further explore whether <italic>UPF1</italic> is recurrently mutated in PASC, we reanalyzed sequencing data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fang et al., 2017</xref> to manually search for <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e-f</xref>). We focused on the two loci that contained all mutations reported by Liu et al. (<italic>UPF1</italic> exons 10-11 and exons 21–23). Because the relevant introns are very short, they were well covered by both the whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing used by Fang et al. Using relaxed mutation-calling criteria to maximize sensitivity (details in Materials and methods), we identified somatic <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations in samples from 6 of 17 PASC patients. However, those mutations exhibited genetic characteristics expected of passenger, not driver, mutations. None of those <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations matched the <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations reported by Liu et al., and only one was present at an allelic frequency equal to the allelic frequency of mutant <italic>KRAS</italic>, which is a known driver and which we detected in samples from all PASC patients (median allelic frequencies of 12% versus 34% for <italic>UPF1</italic> versus <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations). Furthermore, we also identified <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations in samples from patients with non-adenosquamous tumors (3 of 34 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas), whereas Liu et al. reported finding no <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations in non-adenosquamous pancreatic cancers (0 of 29).

The cDNA synthesis reaction was diluted 1:50 and 4 µL was used for a 10 µL qPCR reaction with PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix (ThermoFisher) and primers specific for the reporter mRNA diluted to a working concentration of 100 nM for each primer. qPCR reactions were performed in technical triplicate for three different biological replicates in 384-well plates (ThermoFisher) using an ABI QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR System (ThermoFisher). The levels of pmCMV-Gl-Norm and pmCMV-Gl-39Ter cDNA were normalized to phCMV-MUP mRNA abundance for each sample, and levels of pmCMV-Gl-39Ter cDNA were plotted relative to levels of pmCMV-Gl-Norm for each replicate in each cell type. Statistical analysis was performed using PRISM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunoblots in HEK 293 T cells</title><p>Cells were lysed using a buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, and 50 mM Tris pH 8.0 supplemented with a phosphatase inhibitor (ThermoFisher) and protease inhibitor (ThermoFisher). After the lysis buffer was added, cells were frozen at −80°C and thawed for three cycles, and then incubated on ice for 15 min. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was collected to determine total protein concentration. Total protein concentration was determined using a Qubit (ThermoFisher) and 20 μg of total protein was used for electrophoresis. Following electrophoresis, protein was transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Novex) in transfer buffer containing 10% methanol overnight at 4°C. The blot was blocked with Odyssey Blocking Buffer (LI-COR Biosciences) for 1 hr at room temperature and probed using a 1:1000 dilution of 0.514 mg/mL UPF1 antibody (Abcam, 109363) overnight with shaking at 4°C. Following overnight incubation, the blot was washed three times with 1× TBST buffer at room temperature and probed with rabbit secondary antibody (IRDye 680RD goat anti-rabbit) for 1 hr at room temperature. The blot was then imaged and UPF1 abundance was quantified using band intensity in Fiji (v2.0.0). Statistical analysis was performed using PRISM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Isoform detection by RT-PCR in HEK 293 T cell lines</title><p>Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized using oligo dT primers and SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase (ThermoFisher) following the manufacturer's protocol. PCR was carried out with primers targeting <italic>UPF1</italic> exons 9 and 12 using Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB). PCR products were run in a 2% agarose slab gel and stained with ethidium bromide for visualization by UV shadowing (Bio-Rad Molecular Imager Gel Doc XR+).</p><p>A positive control for the amplification of the truncated <italic>UPF1</italic> variant missing exons 10 and 11 was synthesized as a double-stranded DNA gBlock (IDT). Two different amounts (10 fg and 1 fg) of this ‘spike in’ control was added to separate PCRs containing cDNA from wild-type HEK 293 T cells and amplified in the same manner as described above.</p><p>To quantify the degree of exon skipping (percent ΔE10-11), a background subtraction across the entire gel was first performed in Fiji using a rolling ball radius of 100 pixels. Next, the integrated density of each band was determined, and the density of the lower band in each lane was divided by the total density in that same lane by summing the integrated densities of the upper and lower bands.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Reanalysis of genomic DNA sequencing data from Fang et al.</title><p>Whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fang et al., 2017</xref> were downloaded from the Sequence Read Archive (accession number SRP107982) and mapped to the <italic>UPF1</italic> (chr19:18940305–18979266; hg19/GRCh37 assembly) and <italic>KRAS</italic> (chr12:25356390–25405419; hg19/GRCh37 assembly) gene loci. The first 10 nt of all reads were trimmed off due to low sequencing quality and the trimmed reads were mapped with Bowtie v1.0.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>) with the arguments '-v 3 k 1 m 1 <monospace>--best</monospace> <monospace>--strata</monospace> <monospace>--minins</monospace> 0 <monospace>--maxins</monospace> 1000 <monospace>--fr</monospace>'. Mapped reads were visualized in IGV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Robinson et al., 2011</xref>). Mutation/genetic variant calling thresholds (read coverage depth ≥9 reads and ≥2 reads supporting the mutation/variant) were chosen in order to allow detection of a hotspot <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation (G12 or G13) in every PASC sample in the cohort. That criteria ensured that our thresholds were appropriate for discovering known cancer driver mutations in all samples. A genetic difference from the reference genome was defined as a somatic mutation if it was called in a tumor sample but not in the corresponding patient-matched normal control sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Genome annotations</title><p>Genome and transcriptome annotations for mapping RNA-seq data to the human (NCBI GRCh37/UCSC hg19) genome were generated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dvinge et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, transcriptome annotations from Ensembl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Flicek et al., 2013</xref>) were merged with isoform annotations from the MISO v2.0 database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Katz et al., 2010</xref>) and the UCSC knownGene track (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Meyer et al., 2013</xref>). NMD substrates were defined as those isoforms containing a premature termination codon &gt;50 nt upstream of the last exon–exon junction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>RNA-seq read mapping</title><p>RNA-seq reads were mapped to the transcriptome with RSEM v1.2.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li and Dewey, 2011</xref>) and Bowtie v1.0.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>), where RSEM was modified to invoke Bowtie with the ‘-v2’ option. Reads that are unaligned after this transcriptome mapping were then aligned to the genome with TopHat v2.0.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Trapnell et al., 2009</xref>), as well as mapped to a database of splice junctions that was defined by creating all possible co-linear combinations of 5' and 3' splice sites within every gene. A final file of aligned reads was created by merging the read alignments from TopHat with the read alignments from RSEM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Differential splicing analysis</title><p>MISO v2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Katz et al., 2010</xref>) was used to quantify isoform expression for alternative splicing events. Differentially spliced events were defined as those that met the following criteria: (1) had at least 20 informative reads (reads that uniquely distinguish between isoforms of a given splicing event), (2) exhibited either an absolute change in isoform ratio ≥10% or an absolute fold-change ≥2, and (3) had an associated p≤0.05 (computed using a two-sided t-test). Differential splicing analyses were restricted to splicing events arising from U2-type (major) introns, which constitute &gt;99% of all introns, in order to ensure that no potential confounding effects arose from intron type. Splicing events were defined as NMD relevant if at least one, but not all, of the child isoforms was predicted NMD substrates.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the members of the Bradley, Ventura, and Leach laboratories for comments and suggestions.

Given that the manuscript challenges a striking finding from a prior study that has not been validated in subsequent studies, it is important to publish to correct the literature. At the same time, several points should be clarified to make sure the data are as comprehensive as possible:</p><p>1) In the experiments evaluating the effect of skipping exons 10-11 of <italic>UPF1</italic>, It is surprising that this genetic perturbation in <italic>UPF1</italic> is actually tolerated in these cells as <italic>UPF1</italic> is an essential gene in most cancer cell lines (this point also has likely motivated this current study). Also, the Western blots for <italic>UPF1</italic> protein are not particularly clear (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C) and the fact that the cells don't perturb the growth of KPC cells does not prove that <italic>UPF1</italic> alterations is not tumorigenic. Have the authors checked to see if <italic>UPF1</italic> is downregulated and mis-spliced in the cells following in vivo growth? A simple in vitro competition assay between <italic>UPF1</italic> exon 10-11 targeted cells and control sgRNA cells would also be helpful. It would also be helpful to evaluate if NMD is altered in these cells given these issues.</p><p>2) Although it is clear that the authors have used similar minigene assays as were used in the original publication, a more systematic evaluation for potential alteration in NMD with <italic>UPF1</italic> variants (via RNA-seq) would be helpful given that this work questions the prior publication.</p><p>3) Do the authors believe that the <italic>UPF1</italic> variants reported as mutations initially in PASC are actually SNPs? The terminology describing what these variants are could be a little clearer in the Abstract and Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper aims to resolve the disparity between one report (Liu et al., 2014), which described somatic mutations in pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma (PASC) that did not typify normal pancreatic tissue of the patients, and other reports (Witkiewicz et al., 2015; Fang et al., 2017; Hayashi et al., 2020), which did not find these mutations. The authors show here that many (40%) of the mutations described by Liu et al. typify genetic variations in the human population at large, and they suggest that these mutations are not pathogenic, e.g. are not drivers of PASC, and also not somatic but, rather, are genetic in origin.</p><p>The authors use CRISPR-Cas9 to generate in mouse pancreatic cancer (KPC) cells, which harbor Kras and Tp53 gene mutations (as do PASC patients), a <italic>Upf1</italic> gene, and thus its product mRNA, lacking exons 10 and 11. Liu et al. previously reported this <italic>Upf1</italic> variant not only inhibits NMD by disrupting <italic>UPF1</italic> helicase activity, but also promotes tumorigenesis. After injection into mice, the authors found no detectable effects on pancreatic cancer growth compared to the injection of control cells.</p><p>The authors acknowledge that mice may differ from humans. Thus next, rather than using mini-<italic>UPF1</italic> genes, as did Liu et al., the authors introduced two of the Liu et al. mutations separately into the <italic>UPF1</italic> gene of HEK293T cells. In contrast to Liu et al., the authors found modestly increased NMD efficiency and no evidence of <italic>UPF1</italic> pre-mRNA mis-splicing. The authors note that this makes sense since these mutations are found in people not as somatic mutations but genetic mutations, and thus would not be expected to inhibit NMD given the importance of NMD to aspects of human development in utero and beyond.</p><p>This is a very well-written paper describing carefully executed experiments that lead the reader to discount three claims made about <italic>UPF1</italic> gene mutations in PANC as described by Liu et al., namely, that these mutations: (i) have a somatic origin, (ii) lead to <italic>UPF1</italic> pre-mRNA mis-splicing so as to inhibit NMD, and (iii) promote tumorigenesis. The authors are careful not to over-interpret their data.</p><p>Results, in reference to Figure 1F. It is unexpected that the variations in <italic>UPF1</italic> protein levels were &quot;uncorrelated with NMD efficiency&quot;. Possibly, this reviewer doesn't understand what the authors mean. Please clarify.</p><p>Additionally, in this regard, it is better to draw conclusions about NMD efficiency by measuring more than just the efficiency with which mRNA from a reporter construct is targeted for NMD. It is recommended that the authors assay the levels of a few (e.g. three) cellular NMD targets, normalized to the level of their pre-mRNA to control for any changes to gene transcription.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In the manuscript, Polaski et al. compared the reported <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations with a collection of three databases and found 42.5% of these mutations are identical to germline genetic variation. However, most of these overlapped mutations are located within introns, and only present in Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database (Figure 2). This raised some concerns since the ExAC database mainly report exon variants rather than intron variants. The authors need provide other information such as allele frequency to examine whether these intronic mutations are rare or low-frequency variants.</p><p>Another suggestion is that the authors may cross-reference <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations with the recent gnomAD v3 database (Nature 2020), which provided non-coding genetic variants within much better resolution. In addition, most of the other <italic>UPF1</italic> exon mutations are indeed novel as they are not present in any databases (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). The authors need to provide some additional analysis such as separating these two types of variants (exon/intron variants) and analyzing the frequency of overlapped <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62209.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>Although we append the specific reviewer comments below to aid in your revision, discussion amongst reviewers has generated the following Essential Revision list:</p><p>1) Test additional NMD targets: reviewer 1 mentions doing this in the CRISPR-E10/E11 KPC cells and mining RNA-seq data from previous Upf1 variant data; reviewer 2 mentions analyzing other NMD targets in 293T Upf1 splicing mutant cells, to extend results beyond use of a reporter assay.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewers 1 and 2 for these excellent suggestions to confirm that levels of endogenous substrates are not affected by the <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations reported by Liu et al. We addressed this point by performing high-coverage RNA-seq in biological triplicate on wild-type 293T cells as well as the two distinct <italic>UPF1</italic>-mutant 293T cell lines which we generated (mimicking the mutations reported in “patient 1” and “patient 9” in Liu et al.). We used these RNA-seq data to quantify levels of thousands of NMD substrates arising from alternative splicing across the transcriptome an approach which we have previously used to study NMD perturbation (e.g., Feng et al., 2015) – and identify NMD substrates which were significantly differentially expressed between wild-type and <italic>UPF1</italic>-mutant cell lines. These analyses confirmed the results of our NMD reporter experiments, and clearly demonstrated that levels of endogenous substrates are not higher in either <italic>UPF1</italic>-mutant cell line relative to wild-type cells. The revised text describing these new experiments reads:</p><p>“To confirm these results from reporter experiments, we then queried levels of endogenous NMD substrates across the transcriptome. […] Together, these data confirm that the tested mutations in <italic>UPF1</italic> intron 10 do not affect NMD activity (Figure 2B-D and Figure 2—source data 1-2).”</p><p>Figure 2B illustrates the abundance of NMD substrates arising from differential cassette exon inclusion (“poison exons,” which we have previously shown to be sensitive biomarkers of NMD activity; see Feng et al., 2015 and Thomas et al., Nature Genetics, 2020) in wild-type (WT; x axis) and <italic>UPF1</italic>-mutant (P1; y axis) engineered 293T cells. Global levels of these NMD substrates are similar between the two genotypes.</p><p>We additionally used our new RNA-seq data to confirm our RT-PCR-based conclusion that the two <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations which we studied did not cause exon 10 and 11 skipping. The relevant new text reads:</p><p>“We confirmed these results with our RNA-seq data by mapping all reads against all possible splice junctions connecting exons 9, 10, 11, and 12. These analyses revealed no evidence of splice junctions consistent with the reported exon 10 and 11 skipping or other abnormal exon skipping isoforms (Figure 2G and Figure 2—figure supplement 1E).”</p><p>Finally, please note that we addressed this reviewer request by studying our <italic>UPF1</italic>-mutant 293T cells, rather than the KPC system, because our 293T cells contain the exact mutations reported by Liu et al. Our KPC cells, in contrast, were genetically engineered to lack exons 10 and 11 of <italic>UPF1</italic> in order to force them to produce the UPF1 mRNA isoforms that Liu et al. reported resulted from <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations based on their minigene assays. However, our studies showed that the reported <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations do not cause production of such aberrant UPF1 mRNA isoforms when the mutations are introduced into their endogenous genomic contexts (rather than in Liu et al.’s minigene reporter).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Perform in vitro growth competition assay to rigorously determine if CRISPR-Exon10/Exon11 KPC cells display any difference from control KPC cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. We designed our KPC studies to assess whether production of the reported mis-spliced <italic>UPF1</italic> mRNA resulted in overt differences in tumorigenesis in vivo, including bulk tumor growth, host survival, and acquisition of squamous features. We feel that this was a reasonable approach to test the possible role of <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations in PASC, but agree that our studies do not test how deletion of <italic>UPF1</italic> exons 10 and 11 affects tumor cell growth in vitro.</p><p>As our subsequent molecular studies demonstrated that the reported <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations do not induce exon 10 and 11 skipping, we respectfully request that we be permitted to address this point by editing the text to carefully limit our claims, rather than conducting additional experiments. The revised text reads:</p><p>“We concluded that inducing the reported <italic>Upf1</italic> exon skipping in vivo had no detectable effects on pancreatic cancer growth or acquisition of adenosquamous features in the KPC model. […] Third, as accurate measurement of <italic>Upf1</italic> spicing and UPF1 protein isoforms was only possible for KPC cells prior to orthotopic injection, we cannot infer how the relative frequencies of mis-spliced UPF1 mRNA and the resulting truncated proteins may have changed during tumorigenesis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Conduct additional database queries regarding Upf1 mutations and conduct some additional analyses of their data (as described by reviewer 3).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer #3 for this suggestion, as we agree that it will help to clarify this dataset for the reader. We addressed this point by:</p><p>– Cross-referencing every variant in the supplementary file with the gnomAD v3 database.

We introduced the CRISPR/Cas9 construct that deleted exons 10 and 11 of <italic>Upf1</italic> in KPC cells via an adenoviral vector, which induced gDNA deletion as desired; however, this deletion was incomplete (as is typical for adenoviral delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 constructs). This is evident in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A.</p><p>We hypothesize that most cells likely did not have disruption of both alleles of <italic>Upf1</italic>. This is consistent with prior reports that although deletion of both <italic>Upf1</italic> alleles is embryonic lethal in mice, mice that are heterozygous for <italic>Upf1</italic> deletion are phenotypically normal (Medghalchi et al., 2001).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the Western blots for UPF1 protein are not particularly clear (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C) and the fact that the cells don't perturb the growth of KPC cells does not prove that UPF1 alterations is not tumorigenic. Have the authors checked to see if UPF1 is downregulated and mis-spliced in the cells following in vivo growth?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this point. We confirmed that <italic>Upf1</italic> was mis-spliced and produced abnormal, short protein isoforms by RT-PCR and Western blot after introducing our CRISPR/Cas9 construct in vitro (in the figure noted by the reviewer). We performed these assays on pure KPC cells prior to orthotopic injection in order to generate the most controlled data. We agree that it would be very interesting to study <italic>Upf1</italic> splicing and protein isoforms following in vivo growth; however, as the resulting tumors are a heterogenous population of KPC cells and host cells, the resulting data would be difficult to interpret. We note this point in the revised text as follows:</p><p>“We concluded that inducing the reported <italic>Upf1</italic> exon skipping in vivo had no detectable effects on pancreatic cancer growth or acquisition of adenosquamous features in the KPC model. […] Third, as accurate measurement of <italic>Upf1</italic> spicing and <italic>UPF1</italic> protein isoforms was only possible for KPC cells prior to orthotopic injection, we cannot infer how the relative frequencies of mis-spliced <italic>UPF1</italic> mRNA and the resulting truncated proteins may have changed during tumorigenesis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A simple in vitro competition assay between UPF1 exon 10-11 targeted cells and control sgRNA cells would also be helpful. It would also be helpful to evaluate if NMD is altered in these cells given these issues.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. We designed our KPC studies to assess whether production of the reported mis-spliced <italic>UPF1</italic> mRNA resulted in overt differences in tumorigenesis in vivo, including bulk tumor growth, host survival, and acquisition of squamous features. We feel that this was a reasonable approach to test the possible role of <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations in PASC, but agree that our studies do not test how deletion of <italic>UPF1</italic> exons 10 and 11 affects tumor cell growth in vitro.</p><p>As our subsequent molecular studies demonstrated that the reported <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations do not induce exon 10 and 11 skipping, we respectfully request that we be permitted to address this point by editing the text to carefully limit our claims, rather than conducting additional experiments. The revised text reads:</p><p>“We concluded that inducing the reported <italic>Upf1</italic> exon skipping in vivo had no detectable effects on pancreatic cancer growth or acquisition of adenosquamous features in the KPC model. […] Third, as accurate measurement of <italic>Upf1</italic> spicing and UPF1 protein isoforms was only possible for KPC cells prior to orthotopic injection, we cannot infer how the relative frequencies of mis-spliced <italic>UPF1</italic> mRNA and the resulting truncated proteins may have changed during tumorigenesis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Although it is clear that the authors have used similar minigene assays as were used in the original publication, a more systematic evaluation for potential alteration in NMD with UPF1 variants (via RNA-seq) would be helpful given that this work questions the prior publication.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion to confirm that levels of endogenous substrates are not affected by the <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations reported by Liu et al. We addressed this point by performing high-coverage RNA-seq in biological triplicate on wild-type 293T cells as well as the two distinct <italic>UPF1</italic>-mutant 293T cell lines which we generated (mimicking the mutations reported in “patient 1” and “patient 9” in Liu et al.). We used these RNA-seq data to quantify levels of thousands of NMD substrates arising from alternative splicing across the transcriptome – an approach which we have previously used to study NMD perturbation (e.g., Feng et al., 2015) – and identify NMD substrates which were significantly differentially expressed between wild-type and <italic>UPF1</italic>-mutant cell lines. These analyses confirmed the results of our NMD reporter experiments, and clearly demonstrated that levels of endogenous substrates are not higher in either <italic>UPF1</italic>-mutant cell line relative to wild-type cells. These new data are illustrated in Figure 2B-D of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Do the authors believe that the UPF1 variants reported as mutations initially in PASC are actually SNPs? The terminology describing what these variants are could be a little clearer in the Abstract and Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point for clarification. Yes, we believe that a substantial fraction of the <italic>UPF1</italic> variants that were initially reported as somatic mutations by Liu et al. are actually SNPs, not somatic mutations. However, we were unable to obtain access to primary sequencing data or primary patient materials from the senior author of Liu et al. in order to test whether the reported mutations were actually SNPs. We therefore are hesitant to directly claim that the reported mutations are truly SNPs, since we weren’t able to formally disprove Liu et al.’s claim that they are somatic mutations using Liu et al.’s primary samples or data. We hope that this is reasonable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This paper aims to resolve the disparity between one report (Liu et al., 2014), which described somatic mutations in pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma (PASC) that did not typify normal pancreatic tissue of the patients, and other reports (Witkiewicz et al., 2015; Fang et al., 2017; Hayashi et al., 2020), which did not find these mutations. The authors show here that many (40%) of the mutations described by Liu et al. typify genetic variations in the human population at large, and they suggest that these mutations are not pathogenic, e.g. are not drivers of PASC, and also not somatic but, rather, are genetic in origin.</p><p>The authors use CRISPR-Cas9 to generate in mouse pancreatic cancer (KPC) cells, which harbor Kras and Tp53 gene mutations (as do PASC patients), a Upf1 gene, and thus its product mRNA, lacking exons 10 and 11. Liu et al. previously reported this Upf1 variant not only inhibits NMD by disrupting UPF1 helicase activity, but also promotes tumorigenesis. After injection into mice, the authors found no detectable effects on pancreatic cancer growth compared to the injection of control cells.</p><p>The authors acknowledge that mice may differ from humans. Thus next, rather than using mini-UPF1 genes, as did Liu et al., the authors introduced two of the Liu et al. mutations separately into the UPF1 gene of HEK293T cells. In contrast to Liu et al., the authors found modestly increased NMD efficiency and no evidence of UPF1 pre-mRNA mis-splicing. The authors note that this makes sense since these mutations are found in people not as somatic mutations but genetic mutations, and thus would not be expected to inhibit NMD given the importance of NMD to aspects of human development in utero and beyond.</p><p>This is a very well-written paper describing carefully executed experiments that lead the reader to discount three claims made about UPF1 gene mutations in PANC as described by Liu et al., namely, that these mutations: (i) have a somatic origin, (ii) lead to UPF1 pre-mRNA mis-splicing so as to inhibit NMD, and (iii) promote tumorigenesis. The authors are careful not to over-interpret their data.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s feedback, and particularly the comment that we are “careful not to over-interpret” our data. Given that our studies unexpectedly did not support the conclusions of Liu et al., we tried to be as cautious and careful as possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results, in reference to Figure 1F. It is unexpected that the variations in UPF1 protein levels were &quot;uncorrelated with NMD efficiency&quot;. Possibly, this reviewer doesn't understand what the authors mean. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is interesting that we did not observe a relationship between <italic>UPF1</italic> protein levels in each engineered cell line and NMD efficiency in the same cell line. We hypothesize that this discordance may arise, at least in part, by the fact that <italic>UPF1</italic> phosphorylation is important for NMD to proceed, but most <italic>UPF1</italic> protein is hypophosphorylated (Kurosaki et al., Genes and Development, 2014). The modest differences in total (independent of phosphorylation) <italic>UPF1</italic> protein levels that we observed across our engineered cell lines are presumably insufficient to substantially affect NMD efficiency. Although we feel that this hypothesis is plausible, we did not include it in the text as it is speculative. We modestly revised the text to emphasize the key point, which is that the <italic>UPF1</italic>-mutant cell lines did not exhibit dramatically lower UPF1 protein levels (as expected based on the results of Liu et al.):</p><p>“Although <italic>UPF1</italic> protein levels varied between the individual cell lines, this variation in <italic>UPF1</italic> protein levels was not associated with variation in NMD efficiency and did not segregate with <italic>UPF1</italic> mutational status.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, in this regard, it is better to draw conclusions about NMD efficiency by measuring more than just the efficiency with which mRNA from a reporter construct is targeted for NMD. It is recommended that the authors assay the levels of a few (e.g. three) cellular NMD targets, normalized to the level of their pre-mRNA to control for any changes to gene transcription.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion, which was also suggested by reviewer 1, to confirm that levels of endogenous substrates are not affected by the <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations reported by Liu et al. We addressed this point by performing high-coverage RNA-seq in biological triplicate on wild-type 293T cells as well as the two distinct <italic>UPF1</italic>-mutant 293T cell lines which we generated (mimicking the mutations reported in “patient 1” and “patient 9” in Liu et al.). We used these RNA-seq data to quantify levels of thousands of NMD substrates arising from alternative splicing across the transcriptome – an approach which we have previously used to study NMD perturbation (e.g., Feng et al., 2015) – and identify NMD substrates which were significantly differentially expressed between wild-type and <italic>UPF1</italic>-mutant cell lines. These analyses confirmed the results of our NMD reporter experiments, and clearly demonstrated that levels of endogenous substrates are not higher in either <italic>UPF1</italic>-mutant cell line relative to wild-type cells. These new data are illustrated in Figure 2B-D of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In the manuscript, Polaski et al. compared the reported UPF1 mutations with a collection of three databases and found 42.5% of these mutations are identical to germline genetic variation. However, most of these overlapped mutations are located within introns, and only present in Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database (Figure 2). This raised some concerns since the ExAC database mainly report exon variants rather than intron variants. The authors need provide other information such as allele frequency to examine whether these intronic mutations are rare or low-frequency variants.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. In many ways, we were lucky with our study, as the unusual shortness of the relevant introns (intron 10: 85 bp; intron 21: 110 bp; intron 22: 265 bp) meant that they are well-covered by exome sequencing data. In the revised manuscript, we include a new column for each variant in Supplementary file 4 (the table of reported mutations and their overlap with inherited variants). One reported mutation is extremely common – it is actually present in the reference human genome assembly – while most were relatively rare.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another suggestion is that the authors may cross-reference UPF1 mutations with the recent gnomAD v3 database (Nature 2020), which provided non-coding genetic variants within much better resolution.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We cross-referenced every reported mutation in Supplementary file 4 against the gnomAD v3 database. We confirmed the presence of all variants that we reported in our initial submission, and additionally found one more variant (rs956365722; exon 21) that is present in gnomAD v3, but not in either the ExAC or 1000 Genomes databases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, most of the other UPF1 exon mutations are indeed novel as they are not present in any databases (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). The authors need to provide some additional analysis such as separating these two types of variants (exon/intron variants) and analyzing the frequency of overlapped UPF1 mutations.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point. We agree that it is interesting to note that a large fraction of the reported intronic mutations overlap with genetic variants, while many reported exonic mutations do not. In the revised Supplementary file 4, we separate exonic and intronic variants to clarify to the reader which regions contain which genetic variants. We also highlight this point in the revised text as follows:</p><p>“The distribution of overlaps between reported <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations and standing genetic variation depended strongly upon genic context. A large fraction of reported intronic <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations were identical to standing genetic variation, while the majority of reported exonic <italic>UPF1</italic> mutations were not (Supplementary file 4).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
