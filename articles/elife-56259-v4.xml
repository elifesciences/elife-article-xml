Convergent changes across high-altitude taxa included increased hydroxyacyl-coA dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase activities, decreased lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, creatine kinase, and cytochrome c oxidase activities, and increased myoglobin content. ATP synthase activity increased in only the longest established high-altitude taxa, whereas hexokinase activity increased in only newly established taxa.

Many studies have explored the phenomenon of convergent evolution at molecular and biochemical levels by focusing on a single protein or gene across a broad number of taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Storz, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Storz et al., 2010</xref>). However, we know relatively little about convergence of biochemical pathways, or how long convergent adaptations to an environment may take to evolve. Moreover, when evolution converges upon the same predictable phenotypes, does this process occur quickly over short evolutionary time scales or does it take longer durations to evolve?</p><p>Birds that have adapted to the challenges of high altitude present a compelling system in which to explore the convergence of metabolic pathways in response to common environmental challenges. The cold and hypoxic environment at high altitude requires that endotherms maintain high rates of O<sub>2</sub> consumption for locomotion and thermogenesis in O<sub>2</sub>-thin air (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bishop et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hayes, 1989</xref>). Flying birds face the additional challenge of maintaining lift with reductions in air density, which more than offsets the metabolic savings from reductions in drag, such that birds flying at high altitude must flap their wings harder and maintain higher metabolic rates to stay aloft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bishop et al., 2015</xref>). Both evolved and phenotypically plastic changes in respiratory physiology and metabolism are believed to help mitigate the challenges posed by the cold and hypoxic environment at high altitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beall, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lague et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Monge and León-Velarde, 1991</xref>). In the bar-headed goose (<italic>Anser indicus</italic>), for example, evolutionary adaptations to high altitude appear to have arisen throughout the O<sub>2</sub> transport pathway, including increases in effective ventilation, vital capacity and air-sac volume, haemoglobin-O<sub>2</sub> affinity, capillarity of the flight muscle and heart, and oxidative capacity of the flight muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jessen et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McCracken et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Natarajan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Petschow et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Scott et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Scott and Milsom, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Scott and Milsom, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Scott et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Weibel, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">York et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhang et al., 1996</xref>). However, except for studies of a few key proteins like hemoglobin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Natarajan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Natarajan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Projecto-Garcia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Storz et al., 2010</xref>), we still know little about whether convergent phenotypic changes have arisen across independent high-altitude lineages, particularly for the pathways of energy metabolism that support locomotion and thermogenesis. Metabolic genes have been outliers in genome scans of selection in high-altitude taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Qu et al., 2015</xref>), and recent studies in high-altitude populations of mice and humans point towards skeletal muscle as a common target of selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lundby and Calbet, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Scott et al., 2018</xref>). However, the extent to which convergent reorganization of metabolic pathways has occurred across high-altitude taxa to help sustain locomotion and thermogenesis in hypoxia remains unclear, particularly across species that independently colonized high altitude in the same geographic region.</p><p>The activities of enzymes involved in energy metabolism are important determinants of capacity and flux of metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kurata et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Madhukar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Vogt et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Vogt et al., 2002b</xref>). Flux capacity is an emergent property of the contributions of several enzymes in a pathway that is set via hierarchical regulation, which determines the limits of metabolic fluxes that can be achieved via metabolic regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Suarez and Moyes, 2012</xref>), and the maximal activities of key enzymes can be valuable markers of flux capacity. Some previous studies suggest that the activities of some enzymes in major energy producing pathways differ in high-altitude natives compared to their low-altitude counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dawson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leon-Velarde et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Reynafarje, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rosser and Hochachka, 1993</xref>). However, similar differences in enzymatic activities have not been observed in other studies of high-altitude natives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mathieu-Costello, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Scott et al., 2018</xref>), and most previous work has been limited to a small number of enzymes and/or a single or a handful of species.</p><p>Here, we surveyed variation in 13 metabolic enzymes and myoglobin content across seven species encompassing four genera of high-altitude waterfowl (Family <italic>Anatidae</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Established markers of key metabolic pathways were chosen to provide a holistic view of energy metabolism during locomotion and thermogenesis, including aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial function. We relied primarily on paired-lineage tests to make comparisons between high- and low-altitude taxa within a phylogenetic framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Storz et al., 2010</xref>), but we also complemented these tests with standard ANOVA and phylogenetically independent contrasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Felsenstein, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garland et al., 2005</xref>). We uncovered significant patterns of convergence in the remodeling of energy metabolism pathways in the major locomotor and thermogenic muscle, the pectoralis, between high- and low-altitude populations (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Furthermore, by integrating population genetic data to infer how long each species has been established at high altitude, we show that some high-altitude phenotypes arose quickly whereas others required much longer evolutionary time to arise.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Enzyme pathway diagram illustrating where we observed differences in metabolic enzyme activity and myoglobin content in high-altitude waterfowl compared to their close low-altitude relatives.</title><p>In addition to the observed increases in myoglobin content, increases in the activities of hexokinase, ATP synthase, HOAD, and complex II (succinate dehydrogenase), and decreases in activities of pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase and complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase), we observed no changes in activity for the enzymes citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, complex I (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase), and adenylate kinase.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-56259-fig1-v4.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Diversity in the duration of high-altitude ancestry</title><p>We collected muscle samples of birds from a broad range of high-altitude sites in the Andes and from paired low-altitude sites, from species in the genera <italic>Anas</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 76 specimens), <italic>Lophonetta</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 21 specimens), <italic>Chloephaga</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 20 specimens) and <italic>Oxyura</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 16 specimens).

There was also a significant main effect of altitude (p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>) using two-factor ANOVA and a negative correlation between CK activity and altitude using phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs) (p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1f</xref>). These changes could have been a plastic response to chronic hypoxia, as observed in humans exposed to high altitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Levett et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Viganò et al., 2008</xref>). Since most of the CK in muscle is cytosolic, reductions in CK activity likely reflect a reduction in cytosolic ATP buffering capacity and/or a shift towards a more oxidative phenotype. CK is also expressed in mitochondria of muscle, where it is specialized for high-energy phosphate transfer as part of the phosphocreatine shuttle, a process that could also be impaired if mitochondrial CK activity is reduced in high-altitude waterfowl. However, the activity of the phosphocreatine shuttle is augmented, not reduced, in high-altitude bar-headed geese, and mitochondrial CK expression is elevated in high-altitude deer mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lui et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Scott et al., 2009b</xref>). These results suggest that decreases in CK activity, along with reductions in LDH and PK activities, may be part of a general strategy to down-regulate some contributors to substrate-level phosphorylation in the muscle of high-altitude waterfowl. However, hexokinase (HK) activity was elevated in some of the least established high-altitude taxa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1f</xref>), so the decreases in LDH and PK activities are not associated with general reductions in capacity across glycolysis.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Metabolic enzyme activities for (<bold>A</bold>) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), (<bold>B</bold>) pyruvate kinase (PK), (<bold>C</bold>) creatine kinase (CK), (<bold>D</bold>) hexokinase (HK), and (<bold>E</bold>) 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HOAD), measured in the pectoralis of high- and low-altitude waterfowl.</title><p>The diagonal represents the line of equality (x = y).

HOAD activity was significantly elevated in highland taxa using Wilcoxon’s signed-rank test (p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and there was a significant main effect of altitude using two-factor ANOVA (p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>) and a positive correlation between HOAD activity and altitude using PIC (p=0.0001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1g</xref>). The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) are key regulators of the expression of genes encoding the mitochondrial trifunctional enzyme (the heterooctamer that catalyzes the HOAD step and two additional steps in beta-oxidation) and other enzymes in beta-oxidation (i.e., acyl-CoA dehydrogenases), as well as genes controlling fatty-acid transport into mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fan and Evans, 2015</xref>), so increases in HOAD activity in the flight muscle could reflect a general increase in the capacity for lipid oxidation. However, fatty-acid oxidation is strongly regulated by the enzymes involved in mitochondrial lipid uptake (e.g., carnitine palmitoyl transferase), such that changes in fatty acid oxidation can arise without changes in HOAD activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Morash et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, if increases in HOAD activity are indeed associated with increased capacity for lipid oxidation in the flight muscle, such changes would amplify the already remarkable capacity of birds to support high rates of muscle metabolism and power on lipids alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guglielmo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">O'Brien and Suarez, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Suarez et al., 1986</xref>). Sustained thermogenesis relies heavily on lipid oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marsh and Dawson, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Swanson and Thomas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vaillancourt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Vaillancourt et al., 2005</xref>), such that cold temperatures could have increased lipid metabolism and stimulated a corresponding rise in beta-oxidation capacity in high-altitude birds. Furthermore, there seems to be a positive association between altitude and body lipid content in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Parkash et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sømme et al., 1996</xref>), which could increase dietary lipid availability at high altitude for waterfowl (most of which forage on aquatic insects). There is also evidence showing a positive correlation between dietary lipids and HOAD activity in the pectoralis of both migratory and non-migratory birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guglielmo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maillet and Weber, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nagahuedi et al., 2009</xref>). If high-altitude birds eat more lipid-rich foods than their low-altitude counterparts, then a corresponding increase in lipid metabolism might have stimulated the rise in beta-oxidation capacity.</p><p>There were also convergent changes in complexes II and IV of the electron transport system and in ATP synthase (F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>-ATPase, complex V) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The activities of all TCA cycle enzymes assayed, including citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase, were similar between high- and low-altitude populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). Citrate synthase in particular is a common marker of mitochondrial volume density in muscle tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boushel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dawson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Larsen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mahalingam et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mogensen et al., 2006</xref>), so this result suggests that muscle mitochondrial content was similar between high- and low-altitude populations. The observed changes in complexes II, IV, and V activities could therefore reflect a change in mitochondrial quality affecting the function of a given amount of mitochondria. Complex II activity was higher in multiple high-altitude species (1.05- to 1.51-fold increases, with no change in complex I activity; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>) using Wilcoxon’s signed-rank test (p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and there was a significant main effect of altitude using two-factor ANOVA (p=0.0060; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>) and a positive correlation between complex II activity and altitude using PIC (p=0.0213; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1f</xref>). ATP synthase activity was also higher in multiple (but not all) high-altitude taxa using Wilcoxon’s signed-rank test (p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), supported by results of two-factor ANOVA (altitude effect, p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>) and the positive correlation between ATP synthase activity and altitude using PIC (p=0.0009; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1f</xref>). In contrast, the terminal acceptor for oxygen, cytochrome c oxidase (COX; complex IV), had ~50% lower activity when compared to low-altitude sister taxa across nearly all high-altitude species except the ruddy duck. In fact, there seemed to be a narrow optimum for the activity of COX across high-altitude waterfowl, as all species converged on a strikingly similar value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). COX activity showed a significant reduction in highland taxa using Wilcoxon’s signed-rank test (p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and there was a significant main effect of altitude in two-factor ANOVA (p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>) and a negative correlation between COX activity and altitude using PIC (p=0.0001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1f</xref>). Unique specializations in the activity, structure and function of COX have been observed in the locomotory muscles of several high-altitude taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dawson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lui et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Scott et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sheafor, 2003</xref>). A similar reduction in COX activity (~50% less) was also observed in the cardiac muscle of bar-headed goose compared to low-altitude geese, in association with an increased affinity for cytochrome c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Scott et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, COX of some hypoxia-tolerant fish has decreased activity but a greater affinity for O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lau et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, hypoxia may drive convergent changes in COX and mitochondrial function across vertebrates.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Mitochondrial enzyme activities for (<bold>A</bold>) Complex II, (<bold>B</bold>) Complex IV, and (<bold>C</bold>) ATP synthase measured in the pectoralis of high- and low-altitude waterfowl.</title><p>The diagonal represents the line of equality (x = y).

Body mass, however, was not significantly greater in high-altitude waterfowl (p=0.9707; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>), suggesting that the elevated levels of myoglobin in some high-altitude taxa is not simply due to increased body size. Elevated myoglobin content in flight muscle may serve to increase cellular O<sub>2</sub> stores and to facilitate intracellular O<sub>2</sub> diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kanatous et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wittenberg and Wittenberg, 2003</xref>). Elevated myoglobin content could potentially augment intracellular lipid transport as well, as there are some suggestions that myoglobin may bind and facilitate fatty acid diffusion through the sarcoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gros et al., 2010</xref>). Elevated myoglobin content or transcript expression has been previously observed in some other taxa that reside at and/or were acclimatized to high altitude, including torrent ducks (<italic>Mergantta armata</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dawson et al., 2016</xref>), dogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gimenez et al., 1977</xref>), rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vaughan and Pace, 1956</xref>), and Tibetan humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moore et al., 2002</xref>).

Low-altitude ruddy ducks seem to have fundamentally different physiological and biochemical characteristics than the other low-altitude taxa in this study, with relatively high activities of HOAD, complex II, and HK, relatively low activities of complex IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), and a relatively high haemoglobin-O<sub>2</sub> affinity atypical of low-altitude populations but more similar to high-altitude waterfowl populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Natarajan et al., 2015</xref>). Compared to this low-altitude relative, high-altitude ruddy ducks had decreased activities of both complex II and HOAD in the flight muscle, in contrast to most/all other high-altitude taxa in which the activities of these enzymes were elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), and they also do not show the typical and expected increase in Hb-O<sub>2</sub> affinity that is seen in the other high-altitude waterfowl from this study system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Natarajan et al., 2015</xref>) and in many other high-altitude birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Storz, 2016</xref>).

Using population genetic data for the mtDNA control region, we determined that the high-altitude taxa studied here most likely diverged from their low-altitude sister taxa for evolutionary times that differed by as much as three orders of magnitude, from within the last several thousands of years (i.e., more recently established high-altitude populations) to approximately a million years in the case of species that are now established high-altitude endemic species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In each case, all available evidence indicates that high-altitude taxa were derived from low-altitude ancestral populations and not the reverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bulgarella et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bulgarella et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fjeldså, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graham et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McCracken et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McCracken et al., 2009c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Muñoz-Fuentes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wilson et al., 2013</xref>). This approach allowed us to broadly classify high-altitude taxa into three groups based on their mtDNA divergence: newly established highland populations (~3,000–17,000 years; cinnamon teal, yellow-billed pintail and ruddy duck), intermediate (66,000 years; crested duck), and long established subspecies/species (372,000–947,000 years; puna teal, speckled teal, Andean goose) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). These time since divergence (T) calculations, while approximations, are derived from t/site (τ) values representing the average tree height of all genealogies in each coalescent analysis divided by the mutation rate (μ), assuming a mutation rate of 4.8 × 10–8 substitutions per site per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Peters et al., 2005</xref>) as previously applied to these same species. In support of our inferences about duration of high-altitude ancestry, a very similar rank order is also seen with <italic>Φ<sub>ST</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), which provides an independent estimate of divergence not dependent on any particular mutation rate. Using this rank order, we predicted that some metabolic pathways would only change in the more established lineages (i.e., deeper T, higher <italic>Φ<sub>ST</sub></italic>) that have occupied the high-altitude environment for longer and have therefore experienced hypoxia for longer evolutionary time, therefore with more time for adaptation to proceed.</p><p>Following this classification, ATP synthase activity was elevated in only the most established high-altitude taxa, whereas no differences were observed in the newly established populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>).

These changes would have led to a strong increase in the capacity for ATP synthesis relative to electron transport. Such a change could reduce mitochondrial membrane potential and attenuate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which may be advantageous at high altitude for reducing oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brand et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Korshunov et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Skulachev, 1996</xref>). Increasing ATP synthesis capacity may also reduce the magnitude of phosphorylation control over mitochondrial respiration, shifting more control towards the electron transport system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gnaiger et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jacobs et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pesta and Gnaiger, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our results also show that newly established populations at high altitude show increased HK activity in comparison to low-altitude populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). Most of the low-altitude taxa had very similar HK activities in the flight muscle (with the exception of ruddy ducks).

These transient increases in HK activity along with the convergent reductions in PK and LDH activity suggest that there are broad changes across glycolysis in high-altitude taxa, potentially associated with changes in carbohydrate oxidation and/or lactate production. Hypoxia exposure can lead to plastic increases in the reliance on carbohydrate oxidation in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hochachka et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McClelland et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Robin et al., 1984</xref>) and may be useful at high altitude by generating more ATP per molecule of O<sub>2</sub> than lipid oxidation. However, carbohydrate oxidation may be constrained over time by glycogen stores if carbohydrate fuels cannot be adequately supplied by the circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McClelland, 2004</xref>), and we observed that the rise in HK activity in newly-established populations returned to low-altitude levels in the most established high-altitude taxa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). These particular high-altitude taxa may instead take advantage of more plentiful but O<sub>2</sub>-costly fuels (i.e., lipids), provided that sufficient tissue O<sub>2</sub> supply is maintained by evolved or plastic changes throughout the O<sub>2</sub> transport pathway (e.g., increases in haemoglobin O<sub>2</sub> affinity, expansion of pulmonary O<sub>2</sub> diffusing capacity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maina et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Natarajan et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Convergent changes have occurred in many pathways of metabolism across high-altitude waterfowl, with increases in capacity for beta oxidation of lipids and adjustments in the activity of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) enzymes that likely fine-tune mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, some changes required longer evolutionary time at high altitude to arise, suggesting that adaptive changes in high-altitude taxa may involve several steps, such that some changes are only observed in the longest-established highland taxa. Indeed, some changes in the activities of enzymes involved in metabolizing lipids and carbohydrates may be convergent across taxa (increased HOAD activity, decreased PK and LDH activities), whereas others are more time-dependent. In the latter case, HK activity is elevated in relatively new high-altitude colonists, but is subsequently blunted over evolutionary time. Similar distinctions between convergent (e.g., reduced complex IV activity) and time-dependent (increase in complex V activity in only the most established highland taxa) changes exist for mitochondrial OXPHOS enzymes. It is likely that high-altitude animals rely upon hypoxia acclimatization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hochachka et al., 1998</xref>) when first colonising high altitude, followed by evolved physiological specializations that adjust the capacity and flux of metabolic pathways, along with evolved improvements in mitochondrial O<sub>2</sub> supply that arise from increases in tissue capillarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leon-Velarde et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mathieu-Costello et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Scott et al., 2009a</xref>), Hb-O<sub>2</sub> affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Galen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Natarajan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Projecto-Garcia et al., 2013</xref>), circulatory O<sub>2</sub> delivery, and/or pulmonary O<sub>2</sub> uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calbet et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maina et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McClelland and Scott, 2019</xref>). Our data suggest that increases in capacity for beta oxidation, changes in capacity across glycolysis, and adjustments in mitochondrial function are common strategies to cope with the challenges of high altitudes, but that longer time scales of evolutionary adaptation can be required to fully converge upon the ultimate high-altitude phenotype.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Glucose</td><td>Sigma <break/>G8270</td><td>D-(+)-Glucose <break/>≥99.5% (GC)</td><td>Enzyme assay reagent</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>ATP</td><td>Sigma <break/>A2383</td><td>Adenosine 5’-triphosphate disodium salt hydrate <break/>Grade I,≥99%, from microbial</td><td>Enzyme assay reagent</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>MgCl<sub>2</sub></td><td>Sigma <break/>M8266</td><td>Magnesium Chloride anhydrous,≥98%</td><td>Enzyme assay reagent</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>NADP<sup>+</sup></td><td>BioShop Canada NAD007</td><td>B-NADP, Disodium trihydrate,&gt;95%</td><td>Enzyme assay reagent</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>G6PDH</td><td>Roche <break/>10127655001</td><td>Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6P-DH) grade I, from yeast</td><td>Enzyme assay reagent</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>LDH</td><td>Roche <break/>10127876001</td><td>L-Lactate Dehydrogenase (L-LDH) from rabbit muscle</td><td>Enzyme assay reagent</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>PEP</td><td>Sigma <break/>P7002</td><td>Phosphoenolpyruvic acidtrisodium salt hydrate <break/>≥97% (enzymatic)</td><td>Enzyme assay reagent</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>ADP</td><td>Sigma <break/>A5285</td><td>Adenosine 5’-diphosphate monopotassium salt dehydrate bacterial,≥95%, powder</td><td>Enzyme assay reagent</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Pyruvate</td><td>Sigma <break/>P2256</td><td>Sodium pyruvate <break/>ReagentPlus,≥99%</td><td>Enzyme assay reagent</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>NADH</td><td>BioShop Canada NAD002</td><td>NADH ß-NICOTINAMIDE ADENINE REDUCED</td><td>Enzyme assay reagent</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Oxaloacetate</td><td>Sigma <break/>O4126</td><td>Oxaloacetic acid <break/>≥97% (HPLC)</td><td>Enzyme assay reagent</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Acetyl CoA</td><td>BioShop Canada ACO201</td><td>ACETYL COENZYME A, Trilithium Salt</td><td>Enzyme assay reagent</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>DTNB</td><td>Sigma <break/>D218200</td><td>5,5’-Dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) <break/>ReagentPlus, 99%</td><td>Enzyme assay reagent</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Isocitrate</td><td>Sigma <break/>I1252</td><td>DL-Isocitric acid trisodium salt hydrate <break/>≥93%</td><td>Enzyme assay reagent</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>CoQ<sub>10</sub></td><td>Sigma <break/>C9538</td><td>Coenzyme Q10, <break/>≥98% (HPLC)</td><td>Enzyme assay reagent</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Rotenone</td><td>Sigma <break/>R8875</td><td>Rotenone, <break/>≥95%</td><td>Enzyme assay reagent</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>BSA</td><td>Sigma <break/>A6003</td><td>Bovine Serum Albumin lyophilized powder, essentially fatty acid free,≥96% (agarose gel electrophoresis)</td><td>Enzyme assay reagent</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>KCN</td><td>Sigma <break/>60178</td><td>Potassium cyanide <break/>BioUltra,≥98.0% (AT)</td><td>Enzyme assay reagent</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Succinate</td><td>Sigma <break/>S2378</td><td>Sodium succinate dibasic hexahydrate <break/>ReagentPlus,≥99%</td><td>Enzyme assay reagent</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>DCPIP</td><td>Sigma <break/>D1878</td><td>2,6-Dichloroindophenol sodium salt hydrate, <break/>BioReagent</td><td>Enzyme assay reagent</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>DUB</td><td>Sigma <break/>D7911</td><td>Decylubiquinone, <break/>≥97% (HPLC)</td><td>Enzyme assay reagent</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>CytcCH<sub>2</sub></td><td>Sigma <break/>C7752</td><td>Cytochrome c from equine heart <break/>≥95% based on Mol.

First, we calculated the pairwise fixation index <italic>Φ<sub>ST</sub></italic> between each pair of low- and high-altitude sister populations. We utilized the same previously published mtDNA control region data sets for these populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bulgarella et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bulgarella et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graham et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McCracken et al., 2009c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Muñoz-Fuentes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wilson et al., 2013</xref>). This index of population differentiation, comparable to Wright’s (1965) fixation index <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic>, is bounded by 0 and 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wright, 1965</xref>). Thus, whereas pairs of populations with <italic>Φ<sub>ST</sub></italic> closer to 0 are expected to be recently diverged, <italic>Φ<sub>ST</sub></italic> closer to 1 is indicative of populations with much older divergence, as is the case for fully differentiated species that have ceased gene flow. Populations with intermediate <italic>Φ<sub>ST</sub></italic> are expected to fall somewhere in the middle of this continuum. This approach allowed us to relate metabolic distinctiveness between high- and low-altitude populations to their relative magnitude of genetic divergence. Second, we used a two-population coalescent model in the software IM (Hey Lab, Temple University) to calculate the population divergence parameter, t/site, which represents the average tree height of all genealogies in each coalescent analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hey and Nielsen, 2004</xref>). Multiplied by the mutation rate (μ) this parameter can then be used to calculate time since divergence (T) in years. This has advantages over <italic>Φ<sub>ST</sub></italic> because it allowed us to incorporate evolutionary processes in our model including divergence due to genetic drift, and therefore uncertainty in our estimates, as well as gene flow (i.e., migration in both directions) for which some of these populations have been shown to exhibit more connectivity than others. Starting parameters for these analyses were conditioned on the data by first making several preliminary runs using wide priors and described as published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bulgarella et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bulgarella et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graham et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McCracken et al., 2009c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Muñoz-Fuentes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wilson et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, we were able to convert t/site to time in years using the substitution rate for the 5’ end of the control region published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Peters et al., 2005</xref> of 4.8 × 10<sup>−8</sup> substitutions/site/year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Peters et al., 2005</xref>). This provided an approximation to the date at which these high-altitude populations might have experienced a founder event following the colonization of high altitude for the first time, whereas the rank order of <italic>Φ<sub>ST</sub></italic> also likely corresponds to their rank order newest to oldest high-altitude residents. Finally, it should be noted that the Andes have been rising throughout the Cenozoic for approximately 80 million years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ramos, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Royden et al., 2008</xref>), and while some parts of the Andes uplifted more recently than others, the oldest of these waterfowl populations (i.e., South American sheldgeese) are probably diverged no more than several millions years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson and Sorenson, 1999</xref>). Therefore, in all cases the Andes had already uplifted to close to their present height when these high-altitude populations first became established.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by funds from McMaster University, the Canadian Foundation for Innovation, the Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation, and a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery Grant to GRS.

responses.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Convergent changes in muscle physiology depend on duration of high-altitude ancestry across Andean waterfowl&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Kevin Campbell as Guest Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Rutz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Andrew Murray (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Guest Editor has drafted this decision letter to help you prepare a revised submission. We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162).</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study employed 7 high- and low-altitude species pairs that spanned ~1 million years of evolution in hypoxic environments to identify convergent and time-dependent trajectories in muscle metabolic biochemistry to high altitude environments. Importantly, since the work examines fuel and energy metabolism in flight muscle, rather than oxygen transport, it provides a valuable perspective on what is happening at the level of metabolic biochemistry. Overall, the experiments appear to have been carefully conducted, analyses seem sound (except the construction of the phylogenetic tree, which requires particular attention during revision), and the manuscript is well written.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The precision of writing related to evolution, convergence, and phenotypic plasticity could be improved. The first paragraph doesn't fully account for the wide variety of evolutionary studies of convergence and other processes, and sets up a fairly weak hypothesis about whether convergence is always the same or idiosyncratic because it sets up a black and white dichotomy. Evolution/adaptation/drift are always happening and of course each lineage will have an idiosyncratic process. They may arrive at generally similar phenotypes, but do you ever expect exact matching? The second question about the speed of adaptation is more interesting. Accordingly, the first paragraph or most of it could be dropped and the paper could be started with paragraph 2.</p><p>2) The interpretation of the results pertaining to glycolytic capacity is handled somewhat inconsistently throughout the manuscript. The Abstract states that glycolytic capacity is decreased at altitude, whereas the data for HK activity in particular does not support this conclusion with Figure 1 indicating greater HK activity at high altitude. The argument made in the main text is more subtle, supporting an increase in HK activity in many of the more recent high-altitude populations, but no difference in the more established residents. In fact, HK activity is not lower in any highland waterfowl studied compared with its low altitude counterpart with the exception of the ruddy duck (Supplementary file 1A). Moreover, the difference between the low- and high-altitude Andean goose species is almost two-fold, though this appears not to be significantly different? Could the authors confirm this, as the data in Supplementary file 1A seem to suggest that it might be. The Abstract should be modified to better reflect the manuscript in regards to the above discussion, and would also benefit from the inclusion of additional details regarding what parameters were actually measured.</p><p>3) More information needs to be provided regarding the phylogenetic tree construction methodology, which is central for the phylogenetically independent contrast analysis outlined in the Materials and methods. For instance, what specific algorithm and settings were used in Geneious for the multiple sequence alignment? Was the resulting alignment refined by eye to correct ambiguities, and how were indels dealt with? Additionally, it is stated that the tree was constructed using &quot;neighbor joining&quot; in the Materials and methods (again, with key details/parameters missing), though it is noted that a &quot;UPGMA tree and branch lengths&quot; were used for the PIC analysis. Importantly, the tree presented in Figure 2 is poorly resolved, which may have affected the results of the PIC analyses (several of which were borderline significant). Since the results of the PIC analysis are only meaningful if the input tree is accurate/reliable, the authors should consider using more current and robust tree building methods (e.g., maximum likelihood) with the best-fitting models to better resolve the actual relationships among these species. Additionally, given the relatively low amount of sequence data employed for tree building, the authors should also consider including additional sequence data where available and constraining the positions of certain lineages based on the results of other studies with larger datasets. For example, constraining Loponetta as sister to Anas (see e.g. Bulgarella et al., 2010), and placing Oxyura as the outgroup (see e.g. Gonzalez et al., 2009), though we recommend using more recent/robust phylogenetic hypotheses if available.</p><p>Bulgarella, M., Sorenson, M.D., Peters, J.L., Wilson, R.E. and McCracken, K.G., 2010. Phylogenetic relationships of Amazonetta, Speculanas, Lophonetta, and Tachyeres: four morphologically divergent duck genera endemic to South America. Journal of Avian Biology, 41(2), pp.186-199.</p><p>4) The authors helpfully sampled from three sites in the muscle, at different depths, and took a mean of the activities from each location. Please report the degree of variation between the three locations.</p><p>5) It would be helpful for all data to be presented in the manner of Figures 3, 4, and 5. Figure 6 is useful in showing differences in HK activity and ATPase activity in relation to evolutionary time, but the data in panel 6D, which only shows absolute rates of HK activity for high altitude groups, suggest that HK activity decreases below low altitude values as a function of time, whereas it is higher than in lowland counterparts (albeit not always significantly higher) for almost all species studied.</p><p>6) One of the main themes of the paper was that fatty acid oxidation capacity is increased at high altitude. However, this is based on a single enzyme indicator, HOAD, whereas other aspects of metabolism were assessed with multiple enzymes. This potential limitation should be noted or discussed.</p><p>7) In the third paragraph of the subsection “Convergence Across Multiple Pathways of Energy Metabolism”, the change in complex II (succinate dehydrogenase) activity is attributed to a need to support greater capacities for fatty acid oxidation, though this is not correct. The free FADH2 from beta-oxidation does not donate electrons to complex II (which oxidizes succinate using a fixed FAD/FADH cofactor), but to the electron-transferring flavoprotein complex (CETF). Please clarify/revise.</p><p>8) Why are the results for Complex V (ATP synthase) not reported in the comparisons between populations/species, and included only in the analysis of time? They seem to be important.</p><p>9) The possible explanations for increased ATP-synthase activities at altitude are useful, but the second paragraph of the subsection “Some Metabolic Changes Arise Only After Prolonged Evolutionary Time at High Altitude” refers to anoxia, and does not appear to be relevant to non-anoxia tolerant waterfowl. The authors cite a review article here (Garcia-Aguilar and Cuevez) but the original work was carried out by St-Pierre and colleagues (2000, PNAS, 97(15), pp.8670-8674) in anoxia-tolerant frogs. The relevance to the current study is not clear, since it is not necessarily the case that membrane potential would fall in hypoxia exposed waterfowl (a different state to anoxia).</p><p>10) The authors speculate that the differences in metabolic function are related to hypoxia or cold at altitude, but given this is a flight muscle, how might the decreased air resistance alter the metabolic demand placed on this muscle? Would activity be expected to fall as there is less drag, or might the low air pressure increase the metabolic demand of lift?</p><p>11) In the statistical analyses presented in Supplementary file 1B and C, there are highly significant species by altitude interactions, but these are not addressed. When there are significant interactions, main effects should not be considered until the interactions are addressed, either by plotting them out to see if they are all in the same direction and just have different slopes, or by separating the species and looking at them individually if there is crossover of the effects. The authors need to discuss what the interactions were and how they handled them. Most of these are present in cases where a significant altitude effect was detected, so they are potentially crucial to the conclusions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56259.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>This study employed 7 high- and low-altitude species pairs that spanned ~1 million years of evolution in hypoxic environments to identify convergent and time-dependent trajectories in muscle metabolic biochemistry to high altitude environments.

This has resolved the two polytomies present in our original tree and has resulted in minor changes in the reported statistics; however, there are no changes in the significance reported previously, largely due to the fact that each high-low pair was quite distantly related from all other pairs.

We realize in hindsight that we were inconsistent in how we discussed the issue of glycolytic capacity, both in the Abstract and elsewhere, and we have made several other changes to correct this inconsistency (Abstract, subsections “Convergence Across Multiple Pathways of Energy Metabolism”, “Some Metabolic Changes Arise Only After Prolonged Evolutionary Time at High Altitude”, and “Conclusions”).</p><p>To clarify, differences in HK activity between high- and low-altitude geese are not statistically significant.

The search criterion used for the simplified tree for the PICs was maximum parsimony, as the UPGMA method cannot accommodate a constraint. The maximum parsimony tree with branch lengths (Figure 2) was constrained to the Gonzalez (2009) topology, which is the most comprehensive global phylogeny yet available for <italic>all</italic> of these waterfowl species (Gonzalez, Düttman and Wink, 2009). To clarify their taxonomic position among the many lineages of waterfowl we have added a supplementary figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) showing their position in the Gonzalez et al., 2009 topology. This new figure clearly emphasizes the relatively distant phylogenetic relationships between each high-low pair, although there is a much closer relationship within each high-low pair. We have made a small revision in the Introduction to remove a statement that was inconsistent with this information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Was the resulting alignment refined by eye to correct ambiguities, and how were indels dealt with?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct that the resulting alignment was refined by eye to correct any ambiguities.

After implementing this change we have resolved the polytomies in question that were previously present in the discarded NJ tree. We are unable to use other available sequence data in generating our tree, because there are no other common genes that are available for all species and all populations. The only available gene sequence for all low- and high-altitude taxa is the mitochondrial control region. The data sets in the citations below that were suggested by the reviewers unfortunately possess either a single low-altitude taxon and are missing the corresponding high-altitude taxon or vice versa. Nevertheless, we also ran the PIC analysis with branch lengths set to 1 to help account for potential variation in branch lengths across the tree, and this yielded qualitatively the same pattern of variation as our analyses using the actual branch lengths. Nevertheless, as described in our earlier response, we believe the paired-lineage Wilcoxon tests (rather than the PIC analysis) are the most appropriate for examining the convergent differences that exist across high-low pairs, and we have made changes throughout the manuscript to bring the results of the Wilcoxon tests to the forefront.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Bulgarella, M., Sorenson, M.D., Peters, J.L., Wilson, R.E. and McCracken, K.G., 2010.

This is the correct global waterfowl phylogeny to use as it contained all 7 species sampled in our study (see Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors helpfully sampled from three sites in the muscle, at different depths, and took a mean of the activities from each location. Please report the degree of variation between the three locations.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included an additional table (Supplementary File 1J.) containing the enzymatic activities obtained at each depth of tissue. We have also made a small revision to the main text to describe the general pattern of variation observed between the three locations (subsection “Tissue Sampling”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It would be helpful for all data to be presented in the manner of Figures 3, 4, and 5. Figure 6 is useful in showing differences in HK activity and ATPase activity in relation to evolutionary time, but the data in panel 6D, which only shows absolute rates of HK activity for high altitude groups, suggest that HK activity decreases below low altitude values as a function of time, whereas it is higher than in lowland counterparts (albeit not always significantly higher) for almost all species studied.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added graphs from HK and ATP synthase in Figures 3 and 4 to show the same data consistently across all enzymes. We have also made changes to the text to discuss HK and ATP synthase in the context of convergence (subsections “Convergence Across Multiple Pathways of Energy Metabolism” and “Some Metabolic Changes Arise Only After Prolonged Evolutionary Time at High Altitude”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) One of the main themes of the paper was that fatty acid oxidation capacity is increased at high altitude. However, this is based on a single enzyme indicator, HOAD, whereas other aspects of metabolism were assessed with multiple enzymes. This potential limitation should be noted or discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great point. HOAD is a good marker of beta-oxidation capacity, but the overall capacity for lipid oxidation will of course depend on other key regulators as well (e.g., mitochondrial fatty acid uptake by CPT). We’ve added two new sentences to address this issue (subsection “Convergence Across Multiple Pathways of Energy Metabolism”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In the third paragraph of the subsection “Convergence Across Multiple Pathways of Energy Metabolism”, the change in complex II (succinate dehydrogenase) activity is attributed to a need to support greater capacities for fatty acid oxidation, though this is not correct. The free FADH2 from beta-oxidation does not donate electrons to complex II (which oxidizes succinate using a fixed FAD/FADH cofactor), but to the electron-transferring flavoprotein complex (CETF). Please clarify/revise.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not originally intend to suggest that FADH2 produced via beta-oxidation would be utilized by complex II (TCA cycle), but we agree in hindsight that this point was not clear. Apologies for the confusion, we have deleted this sentence from the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Why are the results for Complex V (ATP synthase) not reported in the comparisons between populations/species, and included only in the analysis of time? They seem to be important.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a short section to report changes in ATP synthase in the context of species-specific changes (subsection “Convergence Across Multiple Pathways of Energy Metabolism”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The possible explanations for increased ATP-synthase activities at altitude are useful, but the second paragraph of the subsection “Some Metabolic Changes Arise Only After Prolonged Evolutionary Time at High Altitude” refers to anoxia, and does not appear to be relevant to non-anoxia tolerant waterfowl. The authors cite a review article here (Garcia-Aguilar and Cuevez) but the original work was carried out by St-Pierre and colleagues (2000, PNAS, 97(15), pp.8670-8674) in anoxia-tolerant frogs. The relevance to the current study is not clear, since it is not necessarily the case that membrane potential would fall in hypoxia exposed waterfowl (a different state to anoxia).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the relevance of this work is not clear for this study and removed this section from the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The authors speculate that the differences in metabolic function are related to hypoxia or cold at altitude, but given this is a flight muscle, how might the decreased air resistance alter the metabolic demand placed on this muscle? Would activity be expected to fall as there is less drag, or might the low air pressure increase the metabolic demand of lift?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great suggestion. In fact, recent work on high-altitude flight in the bar-headed goose done by Bishop et al., 2015, show that the reduction in drag has been shown to be more than offset by the reduction in capacity to produce lift at low air densities, and thus increases the metabolic cost of flight at high altitudes. We have included a sentence outlining this in the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) In the statistical analyses presented in Supplementary file 1B and C, there are highly significant species by altitude interactions, but these are not addressed. When there are significant interactions, main effects should not be considered until the interactions are addressed, either by plotting them out to see if they are all in the same direction and just have different slopes, or by separating the species and looking at them individually if there is crossover of the effects. The authors need to discuss what the interactions were and how they handled them. Most of these are present in cases where a significant altitude effect was detected, so they are potentially crucial to the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>The significant interaction effects were attributed primarily to opposing patterns observed in the ruddy ducks, with the exception of HK and ATPase, where the interaction were attributable to changes observed in either species that are more recently established (HK) or established for longer periods of time at altitude (LDH, ATPsyn). We have added mention of the significant interactions where we discuss these patterns of variation in the Results/Discussion section (subsections “Idiosyncratic Changes in High-Altitude Ruddy Ducks”, “Some Metabolic Changes Arise Only After Prolonged Evolutionary Time at High Altitude”, as well as “Enzyme activities and myoglobin assays”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
