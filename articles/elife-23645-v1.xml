Here, we addressed this problem in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We found that the DCC recruiter, SDC-2, is required to maintain open chromatin at a small number of primary DCC recruitment sites, whose sequence and genomic context are X-specific. Along the X, primary recruitment sites are interspersed with secondary sites, whose function is X-dependent. A secondary site can ectopically recruit the DCC when additional recruitment sites are inserted either in tandem or at a distance (&gt;30 kb). Deletion of a recruitment site on the X results in reduced DCC binding across several megabases surrounded by topologically associating domain (TAD) boundaries.

In many animals, females have two X chromosomes, whereas males have only one. To ensure that females do not end up with a double dose of the proteins encoded by the genes on the X chromosome, animals use a process called dosage compensation to correct this imbalance. The mechanisms underlying this process vary between species, but they typically involve a regulatory complex that binds to the X chromosomes of one sex to modify gene expression.</p><p><italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, for example, is a species of nematode worm in which individuals with two X chromosomes are hermaphrodites and those with one X chromosome are males. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, a regulatory complex, called the dosage compensation complex, attaches to both X chromosomes of a hermaphrodite, and reduces the expression of the genes on each by half to match the level seen in the males. Previous research has shown that short DNA sequences, known as motifs, recruit the dosage compensation complex to the X chromosomes. However, these sequences are also found on the other chromosomes and, until now, it was not known why the complex was only recruited to the X chromosomes.</p><p>Albritton et al. now show the X chromosomes have a ‘hierarchical’ recruitment system. A few sites on the X chromosomes contain clusters of a specific DNA motif, which initiate the process and attract the dosage compensation complex more strongly than other sites. These ‘strong’ recruitment sites are placed across the length of the X chromosomes and cooperate with several ‘weaker’ ones located in between. This way, multiple recruitment sites can cooperate over a long distance, while non-sex chromosomes, which have only one or two stronger recruitment sites, do not have thisadvantage.</p><p>Hierarchy and cooperativity may be general features of gene expression, in which proteins are targeted to chromosomes without the need for having specific motifs at every recruitment site. The way DNA sequences are distributed across the genome may give us clues about their role. Thus, knowing how genomes are structured will help us identify disrupted areas in diseases such as cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23645.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23645.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>dosage compensation</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd><kwd>condensin</kwd><kwd>genomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM107293</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Albritton</surname><given-names>Sarah Elizabeth</given-names></name><name><surname>Kranz</surname><given-names>Anna-Lena</given-names></name><name><surname>Winterkorn</surname><given-names>Lara Heermans</given-names></name><name><surname>Street</surname><given-names>Lena Annika</given-names></name><name><surname>Ercan</surname><given-names>Sevinc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Gene regulatory elements can target a chromatin regulatory complex to a single chromosome in the genome through hierarchical specification and long distance cooperation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic genomes are large, encompassing thousands of genes and spanning across millions of base pairs. In order to fit within the limiting confines of the nucleus, genomic DNA is compacted in a hierarchical manner. Linear DNA wraps around histones to form nucleosomes. A string of nucleosomes makes up the chromatin fibers, which further organize into variably sized topologically associating domains (TADs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dekker and Heard, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Matharu and Ahanger, 2015</xref>). Finally, each chromosome occupies an individual territory within the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dekker and Mirny, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Denker and de Laat, 2016</xref>). Importantly, this genome organization is a dynamic process with implications for transcriptional regulation. For example, nucleosome positioning regulates transcription factor (TF) binding at promoters and enhancers, which in turn interact via long-range chromatin looping. At the domain-scale, the coordinated regulation of many genes across hundreds of kilobases of DNA has been observed in several organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Scott-Boyer and Deschepper, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Spellman and Rubin, 2002</xref>). For instance, the coordinated regulation of gene clusters, such as the <italic>Hox</italic> genes, can span hundreds of kilobases and requires the specific recruitment of regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bauer et al., 2016</xref>). How gene regulatory complexes are specifically targeted to large chromosomal domains remains poorly understood. Research on the X-specific targeting of dosage compensation machinery in various animals helps to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that specifically target chromosomal domains for transcriptional co-regulation.</p><p>X chromosome dosage compensation refers to mechanisms that equalize X chromosome gene expression between males (XY) and females (XX) of diploid species wherein sex is determined by differences in X chromosome copy number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albritton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen and Zhang, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Deng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Lin et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Veitia et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Wheeler et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we focus on the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that act to restore X expression balance between the sexes. In wild type mammals, X expression balance is achieved via X inactivation, wherein one of the two female X chromosomes is transcriptionally silenced during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Heard and Disteche, 2006</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster,</italic> the male-specific lethal (MSL) complex binds to the single X chromosome in males where it upregulates transcription two-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Conrad and Akhtar, 2012</xref>). In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, both hermaphrodite X chromosomes are targeted by the dosage compensation complex (DCC), resulting in a two-fold downregulation of expression from each (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ercan and Lieb, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ercan, 2015</xref>). Although the mechanisms are diverse, in each case, a protein complex is specifically targeted to the X chromosome in only the sex where it regulates transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ercan, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The working model for X-specific binding of the different dosage compensation complexes involves a two-step strategy: recruitment and spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ercan, 2015</xref>). While the mechanism of spreading has been observed to be sequence-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ercan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kelley et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Sun and Birchler, 2009</xref>), in both <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, recruitment is accomplished in part by short DNA sequence motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alekseyenko et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alekseyenko et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ercan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Jans et al., 2009</xref>). Although important for DCC and MSL recruitment, the DNA sequence motifs are not sufficient to explain X-specificity. In both species, motif sequence is found across the genome, and is only slightly enriched on the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alekseyenko et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alekseyenko et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ercan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Jans et al., 2009</xref>). This epitomizes an important open question in general mechanisms of domain-scale gene regulation: how are gene regulatory complexes specifically targeted to large chromosomal domains when their corresponding recruitment motifs lack domain-specificity. In this study, we combined systematic ChIP-seq analysis with recruitment mutants and targeted genome editing to determine how the <italic>C. elegans</italic> DCC is specifically recruited to the X chromosomes. Our work offers an answer to the specificity question, indicating that hierarchy and long-distance cooperation between a set of motif-containing recruitment sites restricts binding of the DCC to the X chromosomes.</p><p>At the core of the DCC is a condensin complex (hereafter condensin DC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Csankovszki et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Csankovszki et al., 2009b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Condensins are evolutionarily conserved protein complexes, most often cited for their role in chromosome condensation and segregation during cell division (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hirano, 2016</xref>]). Recent work also suggests key roles for condensins in gene regulation during interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cobbe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kranz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Longworth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Rawlings et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dej et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Lupo et al., 2001</xref>). Condensins are composed of a dimerizing pair of structural maintenance of chromosomes proteins (SMC-2 and SMC-4) that interact with three chromosome-associated polypeptides (CAPs). <italic>C. elegans</italic> condensin DC shares four out of five subunits (MIX-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lieb et al., 1998</xref>], DPY-26 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Plenefisch et al., 1989</xref>], DPY-28 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Plenefisch et al., 1989</xref>], and CAPG-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Csankovszki et al., 2009b</xref>]) with the canonical condensin I, distinguished only by the SMC-4 variant, DPY-27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Csankovszki et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Csankovszki et al., 2009b</xref>). Condensin DC interacts with at least five non-condensin proteins, SDC-1,2,3, DPY-30, and DPY-21, which together form the genetically defined DCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Meyer, 2005</xref>). With the exception of SDC-1 and DPY-21, all DCC subunits are essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Plenefisch et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Villeneuve and Meyer, 1990</xref>). DPY-30, in addition to its role in dosage compensation, is a subunit of the highly conserved MLL/COMPASS complex, which methylates histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pferdehirt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Li and Kelly, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Shilatifard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hsu and Meyer, 1994</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23645.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>DCC recruitment sites are defined using high resolution ChIP-seq analysis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The <italic>C. elegans</italic> dosage compensation complex (DCC) is composed of a modified condensin complex (condensin DC) which is distinguished from condensin I by the SMC-4 variant, DPY-27.

DCC spreading is independent of X chromosome sequence as the complex is able to spread into autosomal sequence fused to the end of the X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ercan et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, condensin DC spreads more effectively than the recruiter proteins SDC-2 and SDC-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ercan et al., 2009</xref>), highlighting the distinction between recruitment and spreading. Recruitment of the DCC to the X chromosomes is dependent on SDC-2, SDC-3, and DPY-30: SDC-3 binding requires both SDC-2 and DPY-30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Davis and Meyer, 1997</xref>); DPY-30 binding requires both SDC-2 and SDC-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pferdehirt et al., 2011</xref>). Only SDC-2 can localize to the X chromosomes in the absence of other complex members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dawes et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Identification of DNA sequences capable of autonomously recruiting the DCC has previously been conducted using extrachromosomal arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Csankovszki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">McDonel et al., 2006</xref>). Briefly, the DNA fragment to be tested is injected into the worm where it forms a multi-copy array. Fluorescence microscopy is then utilized to assess DCC recruitment to the extrachromosomal sequence. However, the array-based assay is limiting in both function (in that it is not feasible to test every possible X chromosome sequence) and in specificity (in that assaying recruitment to artificial, multi-copy arrays can result in false positives). Here, to overcome these limitations, we used a genomics approach to identify and categorize DCC recruitment sites in the context of the native X chromosome. To better understand how a limited number of recruitment sites function to specifically target the DCC to the X, we investigated the role of DNA sequence and chromatin accessibility on recruitment site activity, and performed targeted genome editing to test recruitment site function.</p><p>Here, we found that DCC recruitment to the X chromosomes is initiated by a small number of strong recruitment sites that contain clusters of a 12 bp DNA sequence motif. Strong recruitment sites display significant overlap with annotated high occupancy transcription factor target (HOT) sites and are marked by DNA-encoded nucleosome occupancy, two features that distinguish motif clusters on the X from those on the autosomes. Strong recruitment sites are distributed along the length of the X chromosome, interspersed by weaker sites whose recruitment function is X-chromosome dependent. We addressed the X-dependent activity of recruitment sites by ectopically inserting recruitment sequence into both the autosomes and the X chromosome. While the ectopic insertion of a recruitment site in single copy failed to fully recruit the DCC to an autosome, both increased copy number and the insertion of additional recruitment sequences at a distance significantly increased DCC recruitment to an ectopic site, suggesting that cooperation between multiple recruitment sites is necessary for robust DCC binding on the X. Furthermore, deletion of a recruitment site resulted in moderate but significant reduction of DCC binding centered on the deleted site and surrounded by strong TAD boundaries. This result suggests that recruitment by multiple sites and subsequent spreading of the DCC in cis within distinct chromosomal domains establishes the full DCC binding pattern.

However, extrachromosomal arrays carry multiple copies of the sequence being tested leaving these assays susceptible to false positives. Many sequences shown to recruit the DCC to a multi-copy extrachromosomal array show little to no DCC binding in ChIP-seq experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Here, to identify sequences that recruit the DCC in the context of the native X chromosome, we used <italic>C. elegans</italic> mixed developmental stage embryos (~100 cell stage and higher obtained by bleaching adults and using similar growth conditions between strains) to perform ChIP-seq analysis of SDC-2, SDC-3, and DPY-30, the proteins required for DCC recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pferdehirt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dawes et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Davis and Meyer, 1997</xref>). Consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ercan et al., 2009</xref>), we found that SDC-2 binding is enriched on the X chromosome: 336 out of 659 (51%) binding sites are on the X. Similarly, 54% (389/719) of SDC-3 and 29% (254/868) of DPY-30 binding peaks are on the X chromosome. The condensin DC portion of the complex, as assayed by DPY-27 ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kranz et al., 2013</xref>), is largely restricted to the X chromosome: over 99% (2546/2564) of DPY-27 binding peaks are on the X.

Thus, in order to define a list of DCC recruitment sites, we began by identifying the 100 strongest SDC-2 ChIP-seq binding peaks in the genome. Of these, 92 overlap with both SDC-3 and DPY-30 binding peaks. DPY-30, as a member of MLL/COMPASS, is associated with the histone modification H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Shilatifard, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Shilatifard, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Xiao et al., 2011</xref>). To remove sites of COMPASS activity, we eliminated peaks that overlap with H3K4me3 enrichment. Lastly, we looked for the presence of condensin DC binding by requiring overlap with a DPY-27 binding peak on the X chromosome. Our criteria for defining recruitment sites was strict; 9 DCC binding loci on the X chromosome were eliminated due to high enrichment of H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Our finalized list of 64 recruitments sites contains 32 out of 47 (68%) <italic>rex</italic>-sites that were shown previously to recruit the DCC to extrachromosomal arrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1D</xref>).

Additionally, we find that, of the 95 strong motifs on the X chromosome, only 50 (52%) are bound by the DCC.

Here, we refined the analysis of motif clustering by defining a motif cluster to be a strong motif (score ≥7) flanked within 200 bp by at least one other motif with a score of 5 or better. Using this definition, we identified 17 homotypic motif clusters on the X chromosome, all of which are bound by the DCC and all of which are contained within a recruitment site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Of the 638 annotated <italic>C. elegans</italic> tRNA genes, 286 (44.8%) are on the X chromosome. Of these, 178 (62.2%) overlap with a condensin DC binding site on the X chromosome, as assayed by DPY-27 ChIP-seq. Interestingly, 16 out of 64 DCC recruitment sites overlap with a tRNA gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This overlap occurs largely at weak recruitment sites, suggesting that canonical condensin recruitment mechanisms at tRNAs may help to reinforce condensin DC binding on the X chromosome downstream of DCC recruitment at strong sites.</p><p>Interestingly, the set of strong recruitment sites is distinguished by an overlap with HOT sites, defined as genomic regions that are bound by a high number of TFs (38 or more of the 57 TFs assayed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Van Nostrand and Kim, 2013</xref>]) without their corresponding motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">modENCODE Consortium et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, HOT sites tend to be CpG-rich and typically show characteristics of open chromatin, including nucleosome depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). Our H3 data confirms a lack of histone binding at all annotated HOT sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In the <italic>sdc-2</italic> null mutant, H3 becomes enriched only at those HOT sites that overlap with a recruitment site, indicating that SDC-2 binding is necessary to keep these HOT sites open. Strikingly, while none of the five autosomal motif clusters are HOT, we find that 11 out of 12 motif clusters on the X chromosome both overlap with a HOT site and are characterized as strong recruitment sites. Importantly, this overlap between homotypic motif clusters and HOT sites on the X chromosome fully distinguishes the X from the autosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Ectopic insertion of <italic>rex-1</italic> fails to robustly recruit the DCC to an autosome</title><p>Our analysis has thus far demonstrated that the 17 strong recruitment sites are distinguished from other motif containing sites in the genome by motif clustering, chromatin structure, and overlap with annotated HOT sites. In addition, these strong recruitment sites are bound by SDC-2 in the absence of other DCC subunits, suggesting a hierarchy of DCC recruitment among the recruitment sites. The presence of weaker recruitment sites that are not as easily distinguishable from autosomal sequence suggests that these sites might be active only in the context of the X chromosome. X chromosome dependence of a subset of recruitment sites is consistent with previous work that demonstrated the inability of some large X chromosome duplications to recruit the DCC when detached from the rest of the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blauwkamp and Csankovszki, 2009</xref>).</p><p>To test X-dependence of recruitment site activity, we ectopically inserted ~400 bp of recruitment site sequence into autosomal loci that do not bind the DCC in wild-type animals. <italic>Rex-1</italic>, here categorized as an intermediate strength site, was the first recruitment sequence identified by multi-copy extrachromosomal array analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">McDonel et al., 2006</xref>).

However, the assay is sensitive to the inherent variability of ChIP between biological replicates, necessitating proper controls for normalization. To account for background noise, we used the ∆∆Ct method to calculate fold enrichment over input compared to a negative control locus. To account for between-replicate differences in ChIP efficiency, we internally normalized fold enrichment to a positive control (<italic>i.e.</italic> the endogenous locus). Experiments were done in biological triplicate and final ChIP-qPCR results were plotted as percent of endogenous recruitment, allowing comparison across experimental set ups.</p><p>ChIP-qPCR results indicate that <italic>rex-1</italic> sequence recruits SDC-3 and DPY-27 at a much lower level when inserted in single copy into chromosome II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

ChIP-seq data also revealed a novel DCC spreading peak just upstream of the <italic>rex-1</italic> insertion site on the X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Although many DCC spreading sites are located in X-linked promoters, this new spreading site is in an un-annotated region. We do not yet understand what may be driving the DCC to spread to this sequence in the ectopic strain where it fails to do so on the wild-type chromosome.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Multiple recruitment sites cooperate to recruit the DCC to the X chromosome</title><p>Single-copy <italic>rex-1</italic> sequence fails to fully recruit the DCC to an autosome, but is sufficient to (both ectopically and endogenously) recruit the DCC to the X chromosome, suggesting X-dependency of <italic>rex-1</italic> activity. DCC recruitment at weaker sites on the X may be dependent on cooperation between multiple recruitment sites. Alternatively, activation of weaker recruitment sites may strictly require the presence of a strong recruitment site. We distinguished between these possibilities by inserting multiple-copies of <italic>rex-1</italic> sequence into two different autosomal loci. If <italic>rex-1</italic> function is dependent on activation by strong recruitment sites, then increasing copy number should have no effect on ectopic recruitment. Alternatively, if multiple recruitment sites function to cooperatively recruit the DCC, then ectopic recruitment should improve upon increased copy-number. Indeed, inserting <italic>rex-1</italic> sequence in three and eight copies respectively increased DPY-27 enrichment to 61.49% and 99.89% of endogenous <italic>rex-1</italic> binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). SDC-3 enrichment similarly increased to 80.98% and 50.08% of endogenous levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These results indicate that <italic>rex-1</italic> sequence in multiple-copy is sufficient to cooperatively recruit the DCC in the absence of strong recruitment sites. This suggests that the presence of strong recruitment sites in the context of the X chromosome enhances and reinforces cooperativity.</p><p>Given that the median distance between recruitment sites on the X is ~90 kb (ranging from 1543 bp to 1.2 Mb), cooperation between sites is likely long-range. To test the ability of recruitment sites to cooperate over long-distances, we used CRISPR to sequentially insert 400 bp of <italic>rex-8</italic> sequence ~30 kb downstream and ~50 kb upstream of the single ectopic <italic>rex-1</italic> that failed to recruit by itself on chromosome II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Notably, we observe similar levels of ectopic recruitment to <italic>rex-8</italic> sequence at three independent insertion loci, suggesting little position effect on recruitment ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Upon addition of <italic>rex-8</italic> at a single locus ~30 kb downstream, recruitment of DPY-27 to the ectopic <italic>rex-1</italic> increased ~1.5 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Insertion of <italic>rex-8</italic> at a second site ~50 kb upstream resulted in further increase in both SDC-3 and DPY-27 binding at the ectopic <italic>rex-1</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). It is remarkable that, without prior knowledge of the mechanism of long-range cooperativity, insertion of <italic>rex-8</italic> sequence at two distant loci resulted in increased ectopic recruitment to the single copy <italic>rex-1</italic> sequence. These results suggest that strong and weak recruitment sites, dispersed across the length of the X chromosome, cooperatively define a recruiting environment that restricts DCC binding to the X chromosome.</p><p>Recent HiC data indicated that interactions between recruitment sites are among the most prominent long-distance contacts on the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crane et al., 2015</xref>). These interactions are largely DCC dependent as many are lost in an <italic>sdc-2</italic> mutant. We used the same data to determine recruitment site interactions, limiting our analysis to interaction scores above a 99% quantile threshold. Accordingly, we found that 62 out of 64 recruitment sites interact with at least one other recruitment site in the wild-type worm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). This level of site-to-site contact is highly significant (p&lt;0.001, permutation test). In the <italic>sdc-2</italic> mutant, the number of interactions is reduced: 35 out of 64 recruitment sites interact with at least one other site. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, 3D interaction between high affinity sites facilitates spreading of the dosage compensation complex across the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Ramírez et al., 2015</xref>). One possible explanation for DCC recruitment to weaker sites, especially to those lacking a motif, is that the complex utilizes pre-established spatial proximity to spread from strong sites. Increased DCC binding might reinforce recruitment site interactions, helping to establish the observed X chromosome conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crane et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>An autosomal 12 bp motif cluster fails to recruit the DCC to the X chromosome</title><p>Because most strong recruitment sites are composed of motif clusters, and because recruitment sites bind the DCC more effectively in the context of the X chromosome, we next tested sufficiency of a motif cluster to recruit the complex when inserted into the X chromosome. To this end, we inserted one of the five identified autosomal motif clusters (containing two motifs) into the X chromosome. We selected this autosomal motif cluster because it contained the strongest scoring motifs (scores 9.5 and 6.25) separated by the shortest genomic distance (68 bp), and was most similar to motif clusters found at strong recruitment sites on the X. To eliminate any potential position effects, we inserted the motif cluster into the same X chromosomal locus where ectopic <italic>rex-1</italic> robustly recruited the DCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The autosomal motif cluster failed to strongly recruit the DCC to the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). This result suggests that motif clustering alone is not sufficient for DCC recruitment, even in the context of the X chromosomes. Because we found that strong recruitment sites containing motif clusters overlap with HOT sites and encode for high intrinsic nucleosome occupancy, we reasoned that flanking DNA sequence and/or chromatin structure is important for DCC recruitment. Compared to motif clusters on the X chromosome (median 0.604), autosomal motif clusters have lower intrinsic nucleosome occupancy (median 0.548) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Interestingly, recruitment sites that do not contain motifs have significantly higher intrinsic nucleosome occupancy than recruitment sites that do contain motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), suggesting that a specific DNA or chromatin structure is important for recruitment activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Single recruitment site deletions affect DCC binding across large chromosomal domains defined by TAD boundaries</title><p>We reasoned that, if recruitment sites act cooperatively to achieve robust and X-specific DCC localization, then deleting a single site on the X chromosome should reveal long-range effects on DCC binding. Using CRISPR, we deleted three recruitment sites on the X chromosome: two strong sites, <italic>rex-40</italic> and <italic>rex-41</italic> are respectively the left and the rightmost strong sites on the X, while the intermediate strength <italic>rex-1</italic> lies ~4 Mb into the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Deletions were confirmed by Sanger sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Compared to wild-type, DPY-27 ChIP-seq data in the <italic>rex-41</italic> deletion strain indicates that the DCC binding profile is largely unchanged along the length of the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). This suggests that DCC recruitment is a robust process; cooperation between the remaining recruitment sites is capable of countering the effect of a single recruitment site deletion.</p><p>Although gross changes are not apparent, we observed a subtle reduction in DCC binding upon <italic>rex-41</italic> deletion. We used a sliding window analysis, an assay more sensitive to slight alterations in DCC enrichment, to determine both the level and significance of change in DCC binding upon recruitment site deletion. Briefly, a 2 Mb window was stepped across each of the ~2500 DPY-27 binding sites on the X chromosome (median step size of 4.8kb). At each step, the mean log2 ChIP-seq ratio between wild-type and recruitment site deletion strain was calculated from all binding sites within the window. To allow comparison across experiments, mean values were normalized using the log2 ratio at the <italic>rex-8</italic> locus and percent deviation from wild-type was plotted. Significance of reduced DCC binding was calculated using students t-test, comparing log2 ratio of DPY-27 binding within a window to binding across the X chromosome. This analysis revealed a significant decrease of ~10–20% in DCC binding across ~1–2 Mb regions surrounding each individual deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Additional analyses using 1 Mb and 500 kb windows indicate similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). DPY-27 ChIP-seq data from a <italic>set-4</italic> mutant strain (defective in dosage compensation but not in DCC localization) revealed no localized reduction of DCC binding, validating the analysis and confirming that the effect on DCC binding is specific to the deletion strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>). Additionally, mRNA-seq data from the <italic>rex-41</italic> deletion strain indicated a significant increase in local gene expression in the affected region, consistent with reduced DCC binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23645.014</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Multiple DCC recruitment sites establish DCC binding within defined X chromosomal domains.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) DPY-27 ChIP-seq data was used to calculate percent deviation from wild-type in three different recruitment site deletion strains.

This observed proximity, calculated by summing the distance between the edges of the DCC depleted regions and the nearest TAD boundary for all three deletions, is expected by chance less than 7% of the time (permutation test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). One possibility is that DCC spreading from recruitment sites is limited to sequences contained within the same TAD. TADs spanning 1–2 Mb have been observed in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Nora et al., 2012</xref>) and <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gabdank et al., 2016</xref>), while smaller domains have been identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (50–100 kb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sexton et al., 2012</xref>). Recent work in <italic>C. elegans</italic> suggests a link between TAD formation and dosage compensation as X chromosome TADs are significantly altered in a dosage compensation mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crane et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, several recruitment sites coincide with annotated TAD boundaries on the <italic>C. elegans</italic> X, suggesting that strong recruitment at one site may prevent spreading across this site. Alternatively, condensin DC may be loaded along the entire length of the X chromosome before spreading, halting at recruitment sites bound by SDC proteins and resulting in condensin DC enrichment at these sites.</p><p>This idea is reminiscent of current models of TAD formation wherein loop extrusion by complexes such as cohesin or condensin form progressively larger loops until stopped by TAD boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sanborn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Nasmyth, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Goloborodko et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Fudenberg et al., 2016</xref>). In these models, boundary elements bound by CTCF block loop extrusion in an orientation dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Fudenberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Rao et al., 2014</xref>). In humans, CTCF sites occur predominantly in a convergent orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Rao et al., 2014</xref>). Though <italic>C. elegans</italic> lack CTCF, we reasoned that motif orientation at recruitment sites might play a similar role. To investigate this possibility, we plotted and listed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5A and B</xref>) the orientation of motifs contained within recruitment sites across the X chromosome, but saw no obvious pattern linking motif orientation to the location of the top HiC contacts. However, it is possible that not all the motifs within a recruitment site are functional. Therefore, given the negative data, we cannot comment on the potential importance of motif orientation in DCC recruitment-mediated TAD organization. Future studies analyzing DCC binding and chromosomal interactions in various recruitment site deletion strains will be needed to elucidate the conservation and diversification of the mechanisms that control condensin recruitment, condensin spreading, and the formation of TAD structures across different systems.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The <italic>C. elegans</italic> DCC is an essential gene regulatory complex, responsible for chromosome-wide repression of X transcription in hermaphrodites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Plenefisch et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kramer et al., 2015</xref>). DCC localization and function is restricted to the hermaphrodite X chromosomes by sex-specific expression of <italic>sdc-2</italic> beginning around the 40 cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dawes et al., 1999</xref>). X-specific binding is hypothesized to include two-steps: initial recognition of the X chromosome (dependent on SDC-2, SDC-3, and DPY-30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pferdehirt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dawes et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Davis and Meyer, 1997</xref>)), followed by DCC spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ercan et al., 2009</xref>). Although the players were known, the exact mechanism that restricts DCC binding to the X chromosome remained unresolved. Our work provides a clear model for how the DCC specifically binds to the <italic>C. elegans</italic> X chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We propose that initial recruitment involves SDC-2 recognition of nucleosome occupied motif clusters within a HOT context marking a small number of X-specific strong recruitment sites. DCC binding at these strong sites initiates an environment amenable to subsequent DCC recruitment at weaker sites. From the recruitment sites, the DCC is able to spread across large chromosomal domains flanked by TAD boundaries. Hierarchical and cooperative DCC recruitment followed by long-range spreading results in DCC binding along the length of the X chromosome. Notably, hierarchy of DCC recruitment, initiating at the strong sites, requires that only few sites on the X need to be distinguished from autosomes while cooperativity between the recruitment sites ensures robust targeting of the DCC to large X chromosomal domains.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23645.020</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>A model for X-specific DCC targeting involves SDC-2 recognizing a small number of initial recruitment sites, followed by cooperative recruitment and DCC spreading to distinct chromosomal domains.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Initial X-recognition occurs at a subset of strong recruitment sites marked by motif clustering, overlap with HOT sites, and intrinsic nucleosome occupancy encoded in DNA. We hypothesize that nucleosome eviction at these HOT sites may be the function of SDC-2 and may additionally rely on yet-unidentified chromatin remodeling factors. SDC-2 binding is necessary to keep these sites open and allows for DCC binding. It is possible that, prior to <italic>sdc-2</italic> expression, closed chromatin prevents improper DCC loading in early embryogenesis, thus ensuring hermaphrodite specificity. Furthermore, initial loading of DCC at a limited number of X-chromosome specific sites would decrease the evolutionary pressure to select for the 12 bp motif at every recruitment site. (<bold>B</bold>) Our working model is that DCC recruitment to strong recruitment sites (1) allows activation of the weaker recruitment sites (2) and spreading of the DCC within topologically associating domains (3). Robust recruitment is dependent on long-range cooperativity, which may function through some combination of long-distance physical interactions, high DCC concentration mediated by DCC sequestration, DCC post-translational modifications, and DCC spreading.

This observation, combined with evidence that DCC enrichment at ectopic <italic>rex-8</italic> (a strong recruitment site) exceeds that of ectopic <italic>rex-1</italic> (an intermediate recruitment site) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), is highly suggestive of a recruitment site hierarchy. Recruitment site hierarchy was recently suggested as a mechanism to specify <italic>Drosophila</italic> MSL binding to the male X chromosome. Sites of initial recruitment, termed PionX, contain a novel motif specified by DNA sequence and shape that serve to distinguish the X chromosome from the autosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Villa et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, we find here that DCC binding on the <italic>C. elegans</italic> X is initiated at a subset of strong recruitment sites distinguished from weaker sites by the presence of 12 bp motif clusters, intrinsic nucleosome occupancy, and overlap with HOT sites. While each of these factors by themselves cannot distinguish the X chromosome from the autosomes, in combination they define a unique set of X-specific DCC recruitment sites. Interestingly, two strong recruitment sites lack motif sequence. It is possible that some yet-unidentified signal (an alternative DNA motif, histone modification, non-coding RNA or long range interaction) may be guiding the DCC to these sites.</p><p>Our work indicates that SDC-2 is required for maintaining open chromatin at strong DCC recruitment sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Additionally, the 12 bp motifs bound by the DCC on the X chromosome are predicted to have higher nucleosome occupancy than motifs that remain unbound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We reason that closed chromatin at the strong recruitment sites prevents the DCC binding prior to <italic>sdc-2</italic> expression, thus ensuring hermaphrodite-specific recruitment of the dosage compensation machinery. This is similar to a recently described mechanism in <italic>Drosophila</italic> wherein the Zelda pioneer protein activates early enhancers by reducing intrinsic nucleosome occupancy and allowing TFs to bind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). It is not yet clear if SDC-2 acts as a pioneer factor, mediating DCC recruitment by increasing DNA accessibility. Alternatively, some yet unidentified factor(s) might work with or in advance of SDC-2 to recognize and evict nucleosomes. For instance, overlap of clustered 12 bp motifs with annotated HOT sites may reflect interaction between SDC-2 and various TFs in establishing open chromatin at recruitment sites. Recent work in fission yeast has proposed a role for transcriptional co-activators Gcn5 and RSC in evicting nucleosomes prior to condensin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Toselli‐-Mollereau et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, it remains unclear how SDC-2 is able to recognize the 12 bp motif, as it contains no known DNA binding domains.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Multiple recruitment sites cooperate to robustly recruit the DCC to large X chromosomal domains</title><p>Ectopic insertion of recruitment site sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,C</xref>) and deletion of recruitment sites on the X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) revealed an important feature of DCC recruitment: the cooperativity of recruitment sites over long distance. In single copy, both <italic>rex-1 and rex-8</italic> recruited the DCC to an autosomal locus at a fraction of their activity on the X. While it is possible that reduced ectopic recruitment is a consequence of chromosomal location, our data shows little evidence for positional effects. We found that <italic>rex-1</italic> sequence inserted in three copies at a secondary autosomal locus similarly showed reduced <italic>rex-1</italic> activity compared to the endogenous site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), and ectopic recruitment to <italic>rex-8</italic> sequence was largely consistent between three chromosome II insertion sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Additionally, others have recently reported that <italic>rex-32</italic> (a strong recruitment site) recruits the DCC to multiple sites across the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Wheeler et al., 2016</xref>). In light of these observations, lack of ectopic DCC recruitment to single-copy autosomal <italic>rex-1</italic> sequence suggests that recruitment activity of this intermediate strength recruitment site is X-dependent, requiring the cooperation of nearby sites. The importance of recruitment site cooperativity is supported by previous observations that several X chromosome duplications containing recruitment sites do not recruit the DCC when detached from the X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Csankovszki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blauwkamp and Csankovszki, 2009</xref>). Here, we found that adding multiple recruitment site sequence either nearby (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) or at a distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) increased ectopic <italic>rex-1</italic> recruitment, while recruitment site deletions resulted in reduced DCC binding across large chromosomal domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Together these results demonstrate the functional importance of cooperation between multiple recruitment sites in establishing robust DCC binding to the X chromosome.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A distinction between condensin DC and SDC subunits of the DCC</title><p>Notably, our ChIP-qPCR data suggests a distinction between recruitment of the condensin DC core and the SDC subunits. In single-copy ectopic <italic>rex-1</italic> and <italic>rex-8</italic> insertions, SDC-3 was recruited better than DPY-27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Adding additional recruitment sites nearby resulted in comparatively larger gains in DPY-27 enrichment, suggesting a greater role for cooperativity in the recruitment of condensin DC. Previous work has also demonstrated a difference in the X-chromosome binding pattern between condensin DC and the SDC proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ercan and Lieb, 2009</xref>). By comparing DCC subunit binding between a well-defined site of spreading and a site of recruitment, it was shown that condensin DC spreads more effectively than both SDC-2 and SDC-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ercan and Lieb, 2009</xref>). Lastly, our ChIP-seq data indicates the presence of the DCC recruitment module (SDC-2, SDC-3, and DPY-30) at scattered sites across all autosomes that fail to recruit condensin DC. These differences, combined with a lack of biochemical evidence for an intact DCC, are highly suggestive of distinct mechanisms governing recruitment of the SDC proteins and of condensin DC. While SDC proteins recognize and target specific sites on the X and the autosomes, condensin DC binding is much more dependent on cooperativity of multiple recruitment sites on the X.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Role of long-range cooperativity and nuclear localization in X-specific DCC targeting</title><p>Because recruitment sites are separated by a median distance of ~90 kb (544 bp – 1.2 Mb) in the native X chromosome, we expect cooperation to act over long-distances. But what is the mechanism governing recruitment site cooperativity? We can imagine several possibilities, none of which are mutually exclusive. First, cooperative 3D interactions between recruitment sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crane et al., 2015</xref>) might reinforce DCC binding by increasing the local concentration of condensin DC. Previous work indicates that DCC binding alters the nuclear positioning of the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Sharma et al., 2014</xref>) and compacts it by ~40% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lau et al., 2014</xref>). It has been postulated that condensin complexes induce chromosome compaction by introducing and stabilizing long-range contacts between distant chromosomal loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cuylen and Haering, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Thadani et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, condensin, similar to cohesin, can entrap DNA, mediating interactions between distant chromosomal sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cuylen et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cuylen et al., 2013</xref>). Recent work in fission yeast demonstrated the ability of condensin to drive long-range associations across distances spanning 100 kb to 1 Mb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, SDC-2 depletion, which results in lack of condensin DC recruitment to the X, reduced the number of 3D contacts between recruitment sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crane et al., 2015</xref>). It is possible that DCC binding strengthens pre-existing X chromosome contacts while simultaneously inducing conformational changes that mediate interactions between recruitment sites and that these direct 3D interactions allow for the cooperative recruitment of the DCC.</p><p>We envision that physical interaction between the DCC recruitment sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crane et al., 2015</xref>) paired with X chromosome compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lau et al., 2014</xref>) may generate a nuclear compartment of high DCC concentration. Sequestration of the DCC to a compacted X chromosome territory may function in restricting re-loading of the DCC to the X chromosome. Potential recruitment sites on the autosomes would not benefit from this increased concentration of the DCC and would fail to maintain DCC binding. This model is reminiscent of transcription factories wherein stable nuclear compartments containing a high local concentration of Pol II lower the threshold for preinitiation complex formation for all nearby promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cook, 2010</xref>). A surplus of DCC would reinforce complex binding at strong sites while simultaneously allowing for DCC recruitment to weaker recruitment sites. Clustering of recruitment sites in the nucleus to generate a compartment for DCC loading is an effective and elegant mechanism by which to cooperatively and specifically recruit the DCC to the X chromosomes.</p><p>Second, it was shown that in vivo depletion of SUMO significantly disrupts DCC recruitment to the X chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Pferdehirt and Meyer, 2013</xref>). Although it is not clear if this effect is direct, western blot and mass-spectrometry analyses indicated that SDC-3, DPY-27, and DPY-28 are targets of SUMOylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Pferdehirt and Meyer, 2013</xref>). DPY-28, the non-SMC subunit that functions in both condensin I and condensin DC, is SUMOylated only in the context of the DCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Pferdehirt and Meyer, 2013</xref>). It may be that successive SUMOylation of DCC subunits at multiple recruitment sites along the X somehow modulates DCC dynamics on the chromatin, perhaps increasing DCC affinity at recruitment sites, thereby reinforcing X specificity.</p><p>Finally, recruitment site cooperativity may be mediated through condensin DC spreading. It has been proposed that after recruitment, the DCC spreads along the length of the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ercan et al., 2009</xref>). Spreading may be achieved by sliding of condensin DC ring along the chromatin. Alternatively, condensin DC may hop to distant chromosomal loci via long-range interactions between recruitment and spreading sites. The mechanism of DCC spreading remains unknown. Notably, the size of the region affected by a recruitment site deletion is similar to the distance that the DCC can spread from the X chromosome into autosomal sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ercan et al., 2009</xref>). In three X;A fusion chromosomes, levels of DCC enrichment on autosomal sequence was shown to be inversely proportional to the distance from the fused end of the X chromosome. Similarly, reduced DCC binding near a deleted recruitment site is also dependent on proximity to the deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The observed pattern of decreased DCC binding in the recruitment site deletion strains suggests that DCC spreading is restricted to TAD boundaries. In mouse embryonic cells, deletion of a boundary element within the <italic>Hox</italic> locus resulted in spreading of active chromatin across the border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Narendra et al., 2015</xref>). Spreading of SMC complexes such as cohesin and condensin, as well as other chromatin regulating proteins may be limited by the TAD boundaries. The DCC is also implicated in the creation of the TAD boundaries themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crane et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that the mechanism by which the DCC is loaded onto and spreads across the chromosome may influence boundary formation. Mechanistically, spreading may serve to both establish and reinforce DCC binding sites across the length of the X chromosome.</p><p>It is not clear if cooperativity also contributes to the X-specific recruitment of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> MSL complex. Although the strategies are distinct, X-specific binding of <italic>the C. elegans</italic> DCC and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> MSL show significant parallels. In both, a DNA sequence motif is important for recruitment, but is not specific to the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Conrad and Akhtar, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alekseyenko et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alekseyenko et al., 2008</xref>). Recent work has indicated that GA repeat expansion around an 8 bp motif core helps specify MSL binding at high affinity sites, mediated through CLAMP zinc-finger binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kuzu et al., 2016</xref>). This dinucleotide expansion may serve to distinguish X and autosomal motif sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kuzu et al., 2016</xref>). However, just like the DCC recruiters (SDC-2, SDC-3 and DPY-30), CLAMP binds to autosomal loci independent of MSL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Soruco et al., 2013</xref>). Previous studies found that ectopic insertion of <italic>Drosophila</italic> high affinity MSL recruitment sites are sufficient to recruit the MSL complex to an autosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kelley et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alekseyenko et al., 2008</xref>). Although the level of this ectopic recruitment was not precisely quantified, it results in spreading to nearby active genes where the complex functions to up-regulate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Ramírez et al., 2015</xref>). It would be interesting to determine if the specific recruitment of <italic>Drosophila</italic> MSL to the X chromosome also involves cooperativity between high affinity sites on the X.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Specificity of condensin targeting to chromosomes</title><p>Condensin complexes are conserved from yeast to humans, functioning in both chromosome condensation during cell division and gene regulation during interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hirano, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cobbe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hirano, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lau and Csankovszki, 2014</xref>). Studies in several organisms have revealed high-resolution condensin binding patterns, demonstrating that condensin complexes bind to distinct intergenic sites that are enriched for promoters and enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kranz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pferdehirt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Dowen et al., 2013</xref>). In yeast, the TATA box binding protein (TBP), the histone acetyltransferase, Gcn5, and the RSC remodeling complex have been shown to recruit condensin to its chromosomal binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Toselli‐-Mollereau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Iwasaki et al., 2015</xref>). While the metazoan condensin recruiters remain largely uncharacterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Piazza et al., 2013</xref>), our previous work indicated that, similar to condensin DC, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> condensin II complex binds to DCC recruitment sites in an SDC-2 dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kranz et al., 2013</xref>). It remains unclear if, similar to condensin DC, recruitment is cooperative for canonical condensins. Interestingly, in yeast, tRNA genes that recruit condensin cluster in three-dimensional space and this clustering is, in part, mediated by condensin itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Haeusler et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, yeast ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeat region robustly recruits condensin in a FOB1 dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Johzuka et al., 2006</xref>). It is possible that the repetitive structure of the rDNA locus allows for cooperative recruitment through multiple tandem copies of the recruiting sequence. Notably, the weaker DCC recruitment sites are enriched at tRNA gene loci, suggesting that once the initial X-specific sites recruit the DCC, common mechanisms of condensin loading help to maintain DCC binding on the X chromosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Long-range cooperation in genome organization and transcriptional regulation</title><p>Our model postulates that long-range cooperation between a hierarchical set of recruitment sites allows for the robust and specific targeting of the DCC to the X chromosomes without the necessity of evolving and maintaining domain-specific motifs at every recruitment site. This model has important implications for TF targeting and domain-level transcriptional regulation in eukaryotic genomes. Recent work in various organisms has begun to focus on the functional role of cooperation between regulatory elements. For example, in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> tandem gene duplications often exhibit higher than 2-fold increased transcription, potentially due to the additive effects of transcription factors binding identical sites on both gene copies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Loehlin and Carroll, 2016</xref>). In human B cells, long-range enhancer interactions help explain lineage-specific control of Tcrb recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Proudhon et al., 2016</xref>). In yeast, cooperation between mating-type silencers leads to transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boscheron et al., 1996</xref>). Finally, similar to how weak recruitment sites bind the DCC only in multiple copies or in the context of the X chromosome, it has been proposed that some <italic>Drosophila</italic> Polycomb domains with weak binding sites may recruit the Polycomb group protein, PHO, through cooperation between high affinity sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Schuettengruber et al., 2014</xref>). From yeast, to flies, to humans, cooperative interactions in 3D space are increasingly being used to explain genome-targeting specificities of proteins important in processes ranging from recombination to transcriptional silencing. We add to this list a clear paradigm for studying the genetic mechanisms behind long-range cooperativity: recruitment of the dosage compensation complex to the <italic>C. elegans</italic> X chromosomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Worm strains and growth</title><p>Wild-type (N2), ERC06 (knuSi254[SNP400bprex-1, unc-119(+)] II; unc-119(ed3) III), ERC08 (knuIs6[pSE-02(400bprex-1SNP), unc-119(+))] I; unc-119(ed3) III), ERC09 (knuIs7[pSE-02(400bprex-1SNP), unc-119(+))] III; unc-119(ed3) III), ERC38 (ers30[delX:17544437–17544484, delX:17545624–17545624]), ERC51 (ersIs17[SNP400bp_rex1, X:14373144]), ERC54 (ers20[delX:4394846–4396180]; knuIs6[pSE-02 (400bprex-1SNP), unc-119(+))] I; unc-119(ed3) III), ERC64 (ers28[delX:806628–806813]; knuIs6[pSE-02(400bprex-1SNP), unc-119(+))] I; unc-119(ed3) III), ERC61 (ersSi25[wt400bp_rex8, cb-unc-119(+)] II; unc-119(ed3) III), ERC62 (ersIs26[X:11093923-11094322[rex-8], II: 8449965); knuSi254[SNP400bprex-1, unc-119(+)] II; unc-119(ed3) III), ERC63 (ersIs27[X:11093923-11094322[rex-8], II:8371600, II:8449968); knuSi254[SNP400bprex-1, unc-119(+)] II; unc-119(ed3) III), ERC66 (ersIs30[V:14040305-14040785[chrV_clusteredmotifs], X:14373144]), TY2205 (her-1(e1520) sdc-3(y126) V; xol-1(y9) X), TY1072 (her-1(e1520) V; sdc-2 (y74) X), MT14911 (set-4 (n4600) II).</p><p>Information regarding strain names, genotype, and generation of all new strains, used in this study can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>. Briefly, for all insertion strains, 400 bp of either <italic>rex</italic>-1 (chrX:4395400–4395799, WS220) or <italic>rex-</italic>8 sequence (chrX:11093923–11094322, WS220), (centered at the DCC ChIP binding peak summit and containing recruitment motif sequence) was integrated into an ectopic genomic location using MosSci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Zeiser et al., 2011</xref>), bombardment, or CRISPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dickinson and Goldstein, 2016</xref>) based techniques. In the bombardment strains (ERC08 and ERC09), insertion sites were mapped using genomic DNA paired end Illumina sequencing data. We isolated discordant read pairs that connected bombarded plasmid sequence to a specific region of the genome, eliminating spurious connections by comparing against paired-end sequencing data obtained from wild-type N2 genomic DNA. Insertion copy-numbers were calculated using qPCR analysis of genomic DNA, normalizing against a negative control region in the genome, and using the single-copy insertion strain (ERC06) generated by MosSCI as a positive control reference. Deletion strains were generated using CRISPR; sgRNAs were designed flanking recruitment site sequence, ensuring deletion of all identified 12 bp motifs contained within. PCR followed by Sanger sequencing was used to validate insertions and deletions. Deleted sequences and the motifs contained within can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>. Strains were maintained at 20°C on NGM agar plates using standard <italic>C. elegans</italic> growth methods. Mixed stage embryos were isolated from gravid adults by bleaching. For ChIP experiments, embryo samples were fixed by treating with 2% formaldehyde for 30 min. For RNA experiments, embryo samples were resuspended in 10 volumes of Trizol.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Antibodies, ChIP-seq, and ChIP-qPCR</title><p><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref> includes the list of the ChIP experiments and information on the antibodies. For ChIP, embryos were washed and dounce homogenized in FA buffer (50 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate; 150 mM NaCl). Sarkosyl (0.1% sodium lauroyl sarcosinate) was added before sonicating to obtain chromatin fragments between 200 and 800 bp in length. As in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ercan et al., 2007</xref>, 1 to 2 mg of embryo extract and 3 to 8 ug of antibody was used per ChIP. For library preparation, half of the ChIP DNA was ligated to Illumina TruSeq adapters and amplified by PCR. Library DNA between 250 and 500 bp was gel purified. Single-end 50 bp sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSeq-2000 at the New York University Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, New York, NY. ChIP-qPCR was performed using 4–5% of each ChIP sample and the corresponding diluted input DNA, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Mukhopadhyay et al. (2008)</xref>. KAPA SYBR FAST 2X qPCR Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems, MA) was used in 20 μl reactions and performed on the Roche LightCycler 480 system. Data (input and chip sample) were used to calculate ∆∆Ct between experimental and control loci. Briefly, ∆∆Ct = (experimental Ct –control Ct) <sub>ChIP</sub> –(experimental Ct –control Ct) <sub>input</sub>. Enrichment over background for both endogenous and ectopic loci was calculated as 2<sup>-∆∆Ct</sup>. Percent endogenous recruitment was then calculated by taking the ratio of ectopic enrichment over endogenous enrichment and multiplying by 100. Because background enrichments are variable between biological replicates, ∆∆Ct and percent endogenous were calculated individually for each replicate.

Mapped reads from ChIP and input were used to call peaks and obtain read coverage per base using MACS version 1.4.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) with default parameters. Coverage per base was normalized to the genome-wide median coverage (excluding the mitochondrial chromosome).

Only those peaks from the combined set that were also present in the majority of the individual replicates were included in the final peak set. Peak summits were determined as the position with the maximum ChIP enrichment score in the combined average. To avoid penalization of long peaks with multiple summits, peaks were split into smaller peaks using PeakAnalyzer version 1.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Salmon-Divon et al., 2010</xref>), with the minimum height being equal to the median coverage at all determined summits of the given data set and a separation float of 0.85.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript Albritton et al. investigate the targeting mechanisms for the dosage compensation machinery in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The nature of the sequences/chromatin features that are required for the targeting of the DCC have been sought, and although rex sequences that are enriched on the X chromosome have indeed been found, unique X-linked sequences do not appear to exist and the question of DCC targeting specificity is still very much open. The authors use ChIP-seq data in embryos, for various DCC components (including SDC-2, SDC-3, DPY-30, DPY-27) and H3K4me3 to identify potential features that can explain X-specificity. The present study analyzed ChIP-seq data for SDC-2, SDC-3, DPY-30, DPY-27 and H3K4me3 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos to identify the 64 strongest binding sites (for DCC subunits that do not overlap with H3K4me3), all of which are on the X, and then analyzed the features of the 17 strongest binding sites in that set of 64. Their analysis supports the existence of a relatively small number of recruitment sites that share several features which together confer X specificity. Those features include a high-scoring binding sequence, other nearby binding sequences, a HOT domain, and intrinsic DNA-driven nucleosome occupancy. The authors also perform elegant functional studies – deletions and knock-ins of predicted recruitment sites. The emerging model is that SDC-2 and other DCC subunits are initially recruited to relatively few strong recruitment sites, spread to nearby weaker recruitment sites via cooperativity, and can further spread within TADs. The paper is well written and represents a significant advance with novel mechanistic insights into the process of dosage compensation in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, although some points need to be addressed:</p><p>Main Points:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> shows reduced association of SDC-2 with X recruitment sites in <italic>sdc-3</italic> mutants. The authors interpret this as persistent association with the strong sites and loss of association with the intermediate and weak sites and use this as evidence for a hierarchy of recruitment between strong and weak sites. Another interpretation is that SDC-2 association is equivalently reduced at all sites. A possible way to examine this further is via a scatter plot and correlation analysis of SDC-2 binding in wild type versus SDC-2 binding in the <italic>sdc-3</italic> mutant. That might help illuminate if in the <italic>sdc-3</italic> mutant the level of SDC-2 binding is reduced equivalently or not on strong, intermediate, and weak recruitment sites. It could also be used to address if there are new SDC-2 binding sites in <italic>sdc-3</italic> compared to wild type.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, how were HOT sites defined i.e. how many TFs bound?</p><p>3) The authors should be more cautious regarding the claim that SDC-2 opens chromatin for initial DCC recruitment. They base themselves on the presence of H3 in <italic>sdc-2</italic> null mutant at the rex sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, in the absence of SDC-2, this site is not bound by the DCC, which allows it to be chromatinized (hence H3 presence). With the current data, it is difficult to distinguish between chromatin opening and simple occupancy of the site by the DCC (in wild-type animals).</p><p>4) Related to the above point, can the authors distinguish if Sdc-2 acts to load the DCC as opposed to trigger focal enrichment (ChIP-seq peaks) at the Sdc-2 binding sites? This could be addressed by analyzing the total number of condensin ChIP-seq tags across the X chromosome (not just peaks) in Sdc-2 (and -3) mutants. If numbers are similar this implies that condensin can still be loaded on the X even without Sdc-2, and that Sdc-2 is therefore likely to be important for concentrating condensin at its binding sites, rather than loading it. Alternatively, if condensin is still present diffusely on the X in <italic>Sdc-2</italic> mutants, then the authors might wish to consider a model whereby long range cooperativity arises by pairs of Sdc-2 bound sites blocking the translocation of condensin, leading to focal condensin enrichment, accumulation of chromatin loops and formation of a TAD boundary (see below).</p><p>5) The part of the paper dealing with TADs raises some very interesting and important issues but merits some clarification and further analyses:</p><p>– In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, a horizontal line indicating zero would be helpful. For the <italic>rex-41</italic> deletion, the DPY-27 signal appears to be consistently below zero for maybe 5MB, across several strong TAD boundaries. Similarly for <italic>rex-40</italic>.</p><p>– The authors chose a 1MB window to average the DPY-27 signal, and report a &quot;significant decrease in DCC binding across ~1-2 MB regions surrounding each deletion&quot;. But with a large 1 MB window the smallest regions that can be detected as DCC depleted seem to be 1-2MB. If DCC depletion were highly localized, for example lost only on one strong DCC site, it is conceivable that it would significantly lower the DPY-27 signal on smoothing windows 1MB in both directions, even though DPY-27 reduction is narrowly localized. It would be helpful to see the data analyzed with significantly smaller smoothing windows in addition to the large-window analysis.</p><p>– The authors state that to be able to compare the DPY-27 signal between wild type and each rex deletion strain, they first normalized each to their respective rex-8 locus DPY-27 signal. Are the authors confident that DPY-27 signal at the rex-8 locus is unaffected in the rex site deletions, e.g. that there is not a global reduction of DPY-27?</p><p>– In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>. A horizontal line indicating zero would again be helpful. In addition to the right-most box, 10th from the right box also has an asterisk and is therefore significantly upregulated? The p-values seem not to be very strong. Were they corrected for multiple hypothesis testing? The authors tested &gt;30 boxes, which would make a corrected p-value significantly higher.</p><p>– In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>. This panel addresses an important point. Please explain what this analysis shows.</p><p>6) An analysis of rex site orientation would be very informative. Current models of TAD formation suggested by the Mirny and the Liebermann-Aiden laboratories (PMIDs 27210764, 27224481, 26499245), based on an early model from Kim Nasmyth suggest a loop extrusion model involving complexes (e.g. SMC) that are stopped by proteins bound at oriented boundaries (CTCF sites in mammalian cells). The parallel for rex sites with the mammalian Cohesin / CTCF system is striking. The authors could explore the orientation of the motifs presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> at recruitment sites (cf. Rao et al. Cell 2014) to see whether pairs of neighboring strong / weak sites tend to be in a specific configuration (convergent, divergent or tandem). In particular they could assess whether orientation of sites inside clusters correlates with DCC recruitment strength and could potentially explain some results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (the orientation is not described in these experiments). This could also be investigated for the TAD boundaries that are found to interact. In this regard, the Crane paper suggests that the strongest rex sites are associated with TAD boundaries, while the model in this paper suggests that strong sites are located inside TADs. A line-up of the relative positions of TAD boundaries and strong/weak recruitment sites will shed light on this. And <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> should be accordingly modified. It would also be informative to show condensin enrichment over oriented strong / weak sites.</p><p>7) More detailed information on the bioinformatics approaches – normalization procedures – for the different data sets should be provided. The use of the mixtools package should be better described. Ideally the authors could provide scripts as part of the paper, or even the entire analysis as in some recent cases (PMID 27919068).</p><p>8) The authors should correct/modify several statements:i) In Abstract: &quot;SDC-2 is required to open chromatin&quot; – please moderate this statement.ii) The second paragraph of the Introduction – the authors introduce dosage compensation and focus only on male / female differences – they should also discuss X:A ratio dosage compensation.iii) In the same paragraph the authors state that in each case of dosage compensation a protein complex is specifically targeted to the X in only the sex where is regulates transcription: this is not true in mammals, Xist RNA is expressed from the X only when there are 2 or more X chromosomes, regardless of whether there is a Y present or not: thus in XO females, as in XY males, there is no targeting of Xist and its protein partners to the X.iv) The authors state in this paragraph that the targeting of the DCC involves a 2-step strategy – recruitment and spreading – again this is a proposal – it should not be stated as a fact.v) At the end of their introduction the authors mention TADs – they do not describe what these correspond to at all – and it is not clear that TADs are universal entities (for example, see review by Dekker and Heard 2015), particularly in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Crane et al., 2015) where they only appear to exist on the dosage compensated X. The authors should explain and cite appropriate references.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Cooperation between a hierarchical set of recruitment sites targets the X chromosome for dosage compensation&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Kevin Struhl (Senior editor), and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are a few remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined in the reviewers comments.</p><p>One particular point concerns the new H3 data provided in Figure 3—figure supplement 1. This data is not strong and the H3 plots should probably be left out. Also, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, it is important to explain if the vertical pink line represents 1 or all 3 deletion-affected regions. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5</xref>, the TAD boundaries as defined by Crane et al. should also be shown on the same graph. Once these changes and the other minor points outlined below are taken into account your paper will be ready for acceptance.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors have addressed most of the issues raised and have improved their manuscript according to many of the suggestions from the reviewers.</p><p>There are just a couple of points that are discussed in the response to reviewers points but that merit inclusion in the revised text:</p><p>Point 4 &quot;While we cannot exclude the possibility that, prior to <italic>sdc-2</italic> expression, some DPY-27 is loosely associated with all chromosomes, the current data suggest that SDC-2 is required for X-specific loading of condensin DC.&quot;</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This revised submission is certainly improved and almost ready for publication.</p><p>The new analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> is nice. We are a bit surprised that in panel B all of the intermediate sites and some of the strong sites display more loss of SDC-2 in the <italic>sdc-3</italic> mutant than the average across the X. Is the X average of -1.280 in panel B driven by many regions of the X having low levels of SDC-2 in both N2 and <italic>sdc-3</italic> (the leftward cloud of gray spots in panel A)? In the main text, I suggest changing &quot;To eliminate the possibility&quot; to &quot;To test the possibility&quot; to avoid having a bias toward certain expected results.</p><p>Are the authors convinced by Figure 3—figure supplement 1 that H3 is enriched at the strong sites in EE? The EE profiles look noisy and would need error bars. Most of the EE samples generated by modENCODE were not that early (not necessarily skewed for &lt;40-cell stage as mentioned in subsection “SDC-2 is required to maintain open chromatin at strong recruitment sites, which display intrinsic DNA-encoded nucleosome occupancy<italic>”</italic>, and later-stage embryos containing more nuclei might dominate ChIP patterns), so using them as representative of pre-DC seems risky. Finally, why are the scales different in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and Figure 3—figure supplement 1?</p><p>In the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, please explain the pink vertical line. Does it represent 1 or all 3 deletion-affected regions?</p><p>In the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5A</xref>, please explain that the numbers in parentheses in panel A are the ranks. In the legend, the sentence &quot;Recent HiC data&quot; needs to be fixed.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This revised version of the manuscript by Albritton et al. integrates all major modifications which we requested on the first review round. Technically, the paper is currently very good and the interpretations of the data careful.</p><p>I was however a little frustrated by the analysis of the TAD boundary/rex site orientation and the subsequent discussion, which is limited to the old loading-spreading model.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23645.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Main Points:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> shows reduced association of SDC-2 with X recruitment sites in sdc-3 mutants. The authors interpret this as persistent association with the strong sites and loss of association with the intermediate and weak sites and use this as evidence for a hierarchy of recruitment between strong and weak sites. Another interpretation is that SDC-2 association is equivalently reduced at all sites. A possible way to examine this further is via a scatter plot and correlation analysis of SDC-2 binding in wild type versus SDC-2 binding in the sdc-3 mutant. That might help illuminate if in the sdc-3 mutant the level of SDC-2 binding is reduced equivalently or not on strong, intermediate, and weak recruitment sites. It could also be used to address if there are new SDC-2 binding sites in sdc-3 compared to wild type.</italic> </p><p>We followed this excellent suggestion and added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. In part A, plotting the average SDC-2 ChIP enrichment within a 200 bp window sliding 100 bp along the genome, in N2 vs TY2205 (<italic>sdc-3</italic> mutant), we observe a striking difference between strong recruitment sites and weaker recruitment sites. Across the X chromosome, the median SDC-2 enrichment ratio between the <italic>sdc-3</italic> mutant and N2 is 0.420. This relationship suggests a consistent decrease in SDC-2 binding across the length of the X chromosome, in agreement with what is known in the literature. We use this median value across the X as a background difference in SDC-2 binding between N2 and our mutant. Focusing next on windows overlapping with weak recruitment sites, a simple linear regression model gives a slope of 0.16. Thus, compared to the background, weak recruitment sites exhibit markedly reduced levels of SDC-2 binding in the <italic>sdc-3</italic> mutant. In contrast, a linear regression model comparing SDC-2 enrichment at the 200bp windows overlapping strong recruitment sites gives a slope of 28.190. This suggests a marked increase in SDC-2 binding at strong recruitment sites in the <italic>sdc-3</italic> mutant compared to background. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> part B includes a scatter plot comparing SDC-2 enrichment in N2 to the log2 change in enrichment in the mutant. Here we focus on just the 64 recruitment sites. Each data point represents a 40bp window around the recruitment site summit. The median log2 ratio across the X chromosome is -1.280. We see that weaker recruitment sites exhibit a markedly lower log2 ratio (median -3.042). Strong recruitment sites have a median log2 ratio of -1.057. In summary, in plotting the SDC-2 enrichment across the X chromosome, we find further support for our interpretation: in an <italic>sdc-3</italic> mutant, SDC-2 is able to identify and bind strong recruitment sites. Lastly, we see no evidence for new SDC-2 binding sites on the X chromosome.</p><p><italic>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, how were HOT sites defined i.e. how many TFs bound?</italic> </p><p>For these analyses, we utilized a previously defined list of annotated HOT sites (see Van Nostrand et al., 2013). Briefly, they identified 296 HOT sites as those bound by 38 or more of the 57 assayed transcription factors (&gt; 65%). We edited the main text to explicitly state this definition, referencing the original paper.

They base themselves on the presence of H3 in sdc-2 null mutant at the rex sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, in the absence of SDC-2, this site is not bound by the DCC, which allows it to be chromatinized (hence H3 presence). With the current data, it is difficult to distinguish between chromatin opening and simple occupancy of the site by the DCC (in wild-type animals).</italic> </p><p>To address this question, we downloaded early embryo H3 ChIP-seq data from modENCODE (GEO Accession: GSE50259). We use the early embryo data as a proxy to measure H3 occupancy before the onset of DCC binding and sdc-2 expression, with the caveat that the early embryo collections are skewed for less than 40-cells, but not absolutely, so some of the cells may already have some SDC-2 binding. Comparing this to mixed stage embryos (which skew toward more than 100-cell stages with full SDC-2 expression) showed a quantitative difference. H3 enrichment across a 1000bp window, centered on the recruitment site summit show that H3 enrichment is higher in the early embryos compared to the mixed stage embryos. In mixed stage embryos, H3 enrichment is reduced in a narrow window around the summit. This observation supports our hypothesis that strong recruitment sites are occupied before SDC-2 binding. This analysis has been added as Figure 3—figure supplement 1. We commented on this analysis in the main text.</p><p><italic>4) Related to the above point, can the authors distinguish if Sdc-2 acts to load the DCC as opposed to trigger focal enrichment (ChIP-seq peaks) at the Sdc-2 binding sites? This could be addressed by analyzing the total number of condensin ChIP-seq tags across the X chromosome (not just peaks) in Sdc-2 (and -3) mutants. If numbers are similar this implies that condensin can still be loaded on the X even without Sdc-2, and that Sdc-2 is therefore likely to be important for concentrating condensin at its binding sites, rather than loading it. Alternatively, if condensin is still present diffusely on the X in Sdc-2 mutants, then the authors might wish to consider a model whereby long range cooperativity arises by pairs of Sdc-2 bound sites blocking the translocation of condensin, leading to focal condensin enrichment, accumulation of chromatin loops and formation of a TAD boundary (see below).</italic> </p><p>The suggested analysis (assessment of condensin DC loading in the mutant background) would require ChIP-seq of the condensin DC-specific subunit, DPY-27, in wild-type as well as the two <italic>sdc</italic> mutant animals. We do not currently have that data. However, the literature indicate that prior to the onset of sdc-2 expression, DPY-27 is diffuse in the nucleus and onset of <italic>sdc-2</italic> expression triggers DPY-27 association with the X chromosome (PMID 10364546). While we cannot exclude the possibility that, prior to sdc-2 expression, <italic>some</italic> DPY-27 is loosely associated with all chromosomes, the current data suggest that SDC-2 is required for X-specific loading of condensin DC.</p><p><italic>5) The part of the paper dealing with TADs raises some very interesting and important issues but merits some clarification and further analyses:</italic></p><p><italic>– In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, a horizontal line indicating zero would be helpful. For the rex-41 deletion, the DPY-27 signal appears to be consistently below zero for maybe 5MB, across several strong TAD boundaries. Similarly for rex-40.</italic> </p><p>These are added.</p><p><italic>– The authors chose a 1MB window to average the DPY-27 signal, and report a &quot;significant decrease in DCC binding across ~1-2 MB regions surrounding each deletion&quot;. But with a large 1 MB window the smallest regions that can be detected as DCC depleted seem to be 1-2MB. If DCC depletion were highly localized, for example lost only on one strong DCC site, it is conceivable that it would significantly lower the DPY-27 signal on smoothing windows 1MB in both directions, even though DPY-27 reduction is narrowly localized. It would be helpful to see the data analyzed with significantly smaller smoothing windows in addition to the large-window analysis.</italic> </p><p>We have added analyses with 500 kb, 1Mb and 2Mb windows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>. Using different size windows show roughly the same pattern of decreased enrichment, and the significant windows are roughly the same size. Furthermore, we are using a variable step sliding window analysis wherein a fixed size window is stepped one peak at a time across the ~2500 DPY-27 peaks on the X. The median distance between the peaks is 4.8kb (with a range of 114bp to 60kb), which is the resolution of the statistics test. Because we are only looking at changes in DPY-27 enrichment at the DPY-27 peaks across the X, window sizes must be large enough to ensure they contain a sufficient number of peaks to allow calculation of p-value using student’s t-test. At a window size of 1Mb, there are between 45 and 183 DPY-27 peaks per window. At a window size of 500kb, there are between 10 and 100 DPY-27 peaks per window. If we were to further reduce the window size to 100kb, there would be only between 2 and 32 DPY-27 summits per window, making a significance test very difficult.</p><p><italic>– The authors state that to be able to compare the DPY-27 signal between wild type and each rex deletion strain, they first normalized each to their respective rex-8 locus DPY-27 signal. Are the authors confident that DPY-27 signal at the rex-8 locus is unaffected in the rex site deletions, e.g. that there is not a global reduction of DPY-27?</italic> </p><p>It is difficult to ascertain absolute level of DPY-27 binding from ChIP data, but the worms with the recruitment site deletions are rigorous and wild type looking, suggesting there is no global changes in dosage compensation. Since ChIP efficiency differs between replicates, to compare data between multiple recruitment site deletion strains, we chose to normalize data to the <italic>rex</italic>-8 locus, which is one of the strongest recruitment elements that is far from the deleted loci. Normalizing the data in this manner affects neither the overall trend of the plot nor the calculated p-values. Even if it were the case that the <italic>rex-</italic>8 had slightly reduced levels of DPY-27, we would be underreporting the percent deviation values without any affect on the localized depletion. For these reasons, we feel confident in presenting the data as the percent deviation normalized to the <italic>rex-</italic>8 locus.</p><p><italic>– In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>. A horizontal line indicating zero would again be helpful. In addition to the right-most box, 10th from the right box also has an asterisk and is therefore significantly upregulated? The p-values seem not to be very strong. Were they corrected for multiple hypothesis testing? The authors tested &gt;30 boxes, which would make a corrected p-value significantly higher.</italic> </p><p>The DCC has only a 2-fold repressive effect on transcription, and the percent reduction in binding is also modest, so we expect the changes to be very subtle. Here, multiple test correction is not appropriate because we are actually doing one test: is the last window on the X containing the deleted site show significant reduction in expression? This is not the same type of question inherent to multiple testing problems in which the tester is interested in <italic>finding the windows</italic> that show significant reduction in expression.</p><p><italic>– In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>. This panel addresses an important point. Please explain what this analysis shows.</italic> </p><p>The analysis shows that the borders of the deletion-affected region and the TAD boundaries are close to each other. Since the effect of each recruitment site deletion is stronger closest to the deleted locus, and tempers off near the TAD boundaries, we interpret this result as TAD boundaries stop the spreading of condensins.</p><p><italic>6) An analysis of rex site orientation would be very informative. Current models of TAD formation suggested by the Mirny and the Liebermann-Aiden laboratories (PMIDs 27210764, 27224481, 26499245), based on an early model from Kim Nasmyth suggest a loop extrusion model involving complexes (e.g. SMC) that are stopped by proteins bound at oriented boundaries (CTCF sites in mammalian cells). The parallel for rex sites with the mammalian Cohesin / CTCF system is striking. The authors could explore the orientation of the motifs presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> at recruitment sites (cf. Rao et al. 2014) to see whether pairs of neighboring strong / weak sites tend to be in a specific configuration (convergent, divergent or tandem). In particular they could assess whether orientation of sites inside clusters correlates with DCC recruitment strength and could potentially explain some results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (the orientation is not described in these experiments). This could also be investigated for the TAD boundaries that are found to interact. In this regard, the Crane paper suggests that the strongest rex sites are associated with TAD boundaries, while the model in this paper suggests that strong sites are located inside TADs. A line-up of the relative positions of TAD boundaries and strong/weak recruitment sites will shed light on this. And <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> should be accordingly modified. It would also be informative to show condensin enrichment over oriented strong / weak sites.</italic> </p><p>We have added relevant analyses as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5</xref>. We investigated if the motif orientation is important for the formation of recruitment site-mediated TAD boundaries across the <italic>C. elegans</italic> X chromosome. We plotted the motif orientation as it relates to DCC binding, both within individual recruitment sites and between neighboring recruitment sites. We could not find an obvious interaction pattern with respect to motif orientation. However, this does not mean that motif orientation does not matter, as we do not know which of the motifs are leading the binding and the interactions.</p><p><italic>7) More detailed information on the bioinformatics approaches – normalization procedures – for the different data sets should be provided. The use of the mixtools package should be better described. Ideally the authors could provide scripts as part of the paper, or even the entire analysis as in some recent cases (PMID 27919068).</italic> </p><p>The Materials and methods section details our normalization procedures and the data analysis steps, and we added the module used in mixtools package, which is referenced if readers require for further information. Our scripts are mostly hardcoded for our HPC system, and not streamlined into a pipeline, but we have a collection of the scripts and a detailed protocol for their usage, and combined them into a Supplementary file. A note to this end is added to the Materials and methods section.</p><p><italic>8) The authors should correct/modify several statements:i) In Abstract: &quot;SDC-2 is required to open chromatin&quot; – please moderate this statement.</italic> </p><p>Abstract edited.</p><p> <italic>ii) The second paragraph of the Introduction – the authors introduce dosage compensation and focus only on male / female differences – they should also discuss X:A ratio dosage compensation.</italic> </p><p>This information is added.</p><p> <italic>iii) In the same paragraph the authors state that in each case of dosage compensation a protein complex is specifically targeted to the X in only the sex where is regulates transcription: this is not true in mammals, Xist RNA is expressed from the X only when there are 2 or more X chromosomes, regardless of whether there is a Y present or not: thus in XO females, as in XY males, there is no targeting of Xist and its protein partners to the X.</italic> </p><p>We are focusing on the wild type conditions, but of course, X chromosome dosage compensation can be uncoupled from sex under mutant conditions in mammals, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. For instance <italic>her-1</italic> mutant XO animals do not recruit the DCC to their X chromosome, despite being phenotypically female. And <italic>tra-1</italic> XX males are able to dosage compensate. We find it is useful to describe the elegance by which the targeting of dosage compensation machinery to the X chromosome happens in one sex in the three described systems.</p><p> <italic>iv) The authors state in this paragraph that the targeting of the DCC involves a 2-step strategy – recruitment and spreading – again this is a proposal – it should not be stated as a fact.</italic> </p><p>This is corrected.</p><p> <italic>v) At the end of their introduction the authors mention TADs – they do not describe what these correspond to at all – and it is not clear that TADs are universal entities (for example, see review by Dekker and Heard 2015), particularly in C. elegans (Crane et al., 2015) where they only appear to exist on the dosage compensated X. The authors should explain and cite appropriate references.</italic></p><p>Text and references have been added.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are a few remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined in the reviewers comments.</italic> </p><p><italic>One particular point concerns the new H3 data provided in Figure 3—figure supplement 1.
