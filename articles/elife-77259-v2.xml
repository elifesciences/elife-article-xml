Transcription factors (TFs) determine cellular identity via direct modulation of genetic transcription and recruiting chromatin modifiers. However, our understanding of the mechanisms that define neuronal identity and their magnitude remain a critical barrier to elucidate the etiology of congenital and neurodegenerative disorders. The rodent vomeronasal organ provides a unique system to examine in detail the molecular mechanisms underlying the differentiation and maturation of chemosensory neurons. Here, we demonstrated that the identity of postmitotic/maturing vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs), and vomeronasal-dependent behaviors can be reprogrammed through the rescue of <italic>Tfap2e/</italic>AP-2ε expression in the <italic>Tfap2e<sup>Null</sup></italic> mice, and partially reprogrammed by inducing ectopic <italic>Tfap2e</italic> expression in mature apical VSNs.

During neuronal differentiation, terminal selectors can activate identity-specific genes that define functional properties specific to a particular neuronal type. However, reprograming postmitotic neurons by ectopically expressing terminal selectors in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> suggests that the ‘reprogrammability’ of neurons is progressively lost during postembryonic life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Patel and Hobert, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Patel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rahe and Hobert, 2019</xref>). This reduction in cellular plasticity may arise from chromatin modifications that prevent the activation of alternative differentiation programs. However, sensory neurons of the vomeronasal organ (VNO) in rodents can undergo some postnatal reprogramming following the aberrant expression of TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lin et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The accessory olfactory system (AOS) contains the VNO, which is primarily responsible for detecting odors and chemosignals that trigger social and sexual behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Trouillet et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Trouillet et al., 2021</xref>). The vomeronasal sensory epithelium of rodents is mainly composed of VSNs. The VSN populations selectively express only one or two receptors encoded by the two vomeronasal receptor (VR) gene families: V1R and V2R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dulac and Axel, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herrada and Dulac, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matsunami and Buck, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ryba and Tirindelli, 1997</xref>). V1R- and V2R-expressing neuronal populations each detect distinct chemosignals, induce different innate behaviors, show distinct localization patterns in the VNO, and project to specific areas of the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cloutier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dulac and Axel, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Isogai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Katreddi and Forni, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mohrhardt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mombaerts et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stowers et al., 2002</xref>). The V2R-expressing neurons localize to the basal portions of the vomeronasal epithelium (VNE) and around the vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Naik et al., 2020</xref>), while V1R-expressing neurons localize to the apical part. Basal and apical VSNs continually regenerate from common pools of Achaete Scute like-1 (Ascl1)-positive neural progenitor cells localized in the lateral and basal margins of the VNE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cau et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de la Rosa-Prieto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Katreddi and Forni, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martínez-Marcos et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Murray et al., 2003</xref>). However, we are only starting to understand how the apical and basal VSN cell differentiation programs are initiated and which factors aide in maintaining apical and basal neuronal identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Enomoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Katreddi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Naik et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Oboti et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Establishing functional basal and apical VSNs is crucial for intra- and interspecies social interactions in rodents. Deficits in basal neuron functionality prevented sex discrimination, reduced male-male and maternal aggressive behaviors, and inhibited the detection of predator odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chamero et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stowers et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>TFs can drive cellular processes that control the expression of genes defining their cellular and functional identity. The AP-2 family of TFs is comprised of five members: AP-2α, AP-2β, AP-2γ, AP-2δ, and AP-2ε, which are encoded by distinct genes (<italic>Tfap2a, Tfap2b, Tfap2c, Tfap2d, Tfap2e</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eckert et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pellikainen and Kosma, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wankhade et al., 2000</xref>). AP-2 family members play critical roles during development, such as contributing to neural crest differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Luo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rothstein and Simoes-Costa, 2020</xref>), cell specification, limb development, and organogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bassett et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chambers et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kantarci et al., 2015</xref>). Some AP-2 family members may have pioneer factor properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fernandez Garcia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rothstein and Simoes-Costa, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Seberg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Williams et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Aside from <italic>Tfap2e</italic>, Notch signaling and Bcl11b control Gαo+VSNs’ differentiation, homeostasis, and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Enomoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Katreddi et al., 2022</xref>). We previously proposed that <italic>Tfap2e</italic>, which is only expressed after the apical and basal VSN dichotomy is established, is necessary for further specification of basal VSN identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lin et al., 2018</xref>). Using mice expressing non-functional AP-2ε, we discovered that VSNs can still acquire the Gαo+/basal identity; however, these VSNs have reduced survival and can acquire some Gαi2+/apical VSNs’ molecular features over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lin et al., 2018</xref>). While we examined the role of <italic>Tfap2e</italic> in maintaining cellular identity and homeostasis of the VNE, critical outstanding questions remain unresolved. What role does this TF actively play to control the basal genetic program? What is the extent of cellular plasticity in differentiated neurons in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Patel and Hobert, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rahe and Hobert, 2019</xref>)?</p><p>Here, we aimed to understand (1) if AP-2ε functions as a terminal selector factor for basal VSNs, (2) how much cellular plasticity postmitotic neurons retain once differentiated, and (3) to what extent genetic dysregulation in mature VSNs translates into behavioral changes. We generated a Cre-inducible mouse line, where we inserted the <italic>Tfap2e</italic> gene into the <italic>Rosa26</italic> locus. Using this knock-in mouse line, we could (1) rescue the <italic>Tfap2e</italic> knockout (KO’s) VNO morphology and functionality and (2) ectopically express <italic>Tfap2e</italic> in maturing Gαi2+/apical VSNs. This approach enabled us to assess its ability to reprogram differentiated apical VSNs to basal VSNs. By combining histological analyses, behavioral assessments, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, we examined whether <italic>Tfap2e</italic> functions as a master regulator to reprogram differentiated neurons and alter animal behaviors. In addition, we used CUT&amp;RUN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Skene et al., 2018</xref>) to identify direct genetic targets of AP-2ε that controls the basal VSNs’ identity program. Overall, we suggest that AP-2ε partially functions as a terminal selector by activating some basally enriched genes while simultaneously suppressing specific apically enriched genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transcriptome differences between apical and basal VSNs</title><p>Using scRNA-seq on VNOs from <italic>Omp<sup>Cre</sup></italic> heterozygous control mice at P10, we identified key features of VSNs based on the expression plots.

This suggests that in control animals apical VSNs either express V2R genes below immune detectability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>) or that post-transcriptional mechanisms may play roles in silencing translation.</p><p>Using pS6 immunoreactivity to detect activated VSNs, and cFos to detect signal transduction in the AOB revealed that ectopic mutants have an overall decreased apical cells’ ability to detect and transduce signals to the aAOB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Notably these defects resulted more obvious, in both males and females, after female bedding exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Although the transcriptome profile of apical neurons in <italic>Omp<sup>Cre</sup>/</italic>R26AP-2ε mutants is changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), we did not observe significant changes in V1R gene expression. As many genes seem to be mis-regulated, it is tempting to speculate that the reduced response of apical neurons to stimuli is a result of changes in post-transcriptional or post-translational modification, trafficking of the receptors, or even competition between <italic>Gnai2</italic> and <italic>Gnao1</italic>. Conditional ablation of normal apical VSN signal transduction does not undermine intermale aggression, rather it enhances territorial aggression in mutant males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Trouillet et al., 2019</xref>). In line with this, we found that <italic>Omp<sup>Cre</sup>/</italic>R26AP-2ε mutants displaying aggressive behavior had higher levels of aggression toward male intruders when compared to WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). These data indicate that ectopic <italic>Tfap2e</italic> expression in V1R neurons is sufficient to partially subvert their function and therefore alter intrinsic social behaviors.</p><p>In rodents, olfactory sex discrimination persists after VNO excision; however, preference for opposite sex odorants is mediated by the AOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Keller et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pankevich et al., 2004</xref>). Despite the partial desensitization of the apical VSNs in <italic>Omp<sup>Cre</sup>/</italic>R26AP-2ε mutants, transcriptome and morphological changes in the VNO did not compromise normal sex odorant preference in male or female mutants. In fact, conditional ablation of Gαi2, which is required for normal signaling of apical VSNs, did not alter normal male sexual behavior, including male preference for estrous female urine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Trouillet et al., 2019</xref>). Our data support a dispensable role for apical VSNs neurons in the tested sexual behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C, D and H</xref>).</p><p>To elucidate the mechanism of action of AP-2ε, we performed CUT&amp;RUN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Skene et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Skene and Henikoff, 2017</xref>). This analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) identified putative direct targets of AP-2ε and showed 3000+ putative binding sites in the vomeronasal tissue. The specificity of binding was confirmed by CUT&amp;RUN experiments on <italic>Tfap2e</italic> KOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). In the identified AP-2ε target genes, we found that most of the binding sites were primarily in promoter regions, not in intergenic and intronic regions. These data suggest that AP-2ε’s main mechanism of action directly regulates gene transcription with perhaps a secondary role at enhancer regions. We found that AP-2ε bound to the up- and downregulated genes in both apical VSNs and sustentacular cells in the <italic>Omp<sup>Cre</sup>/</italic>R26AP-2ε ectopic mouse line, which suggests that AP-2ε can act as both a transcriptional activator and repressor. Motif analysis of these up- and downregulated regions indicates that AP-2ε may function in concert with specific transcriptional cofactors to fulfill a dual role in maintaining the basal VSN genetic program and restricting cellular plasticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Notably our CUT&amp;RUN data showed an enrichment of factors involved in transcription coregulator activity, histone modification, and chromatin modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). These data indicate that AP-2ε may play a role in modifying the chromatin landscape indirectly or in tandem with these transcriptional cofactors to regulate the basal genetic program. Even though transcriptome and histological analysis of the VNE showed significant changes in canonical apical and basal specific genes, we only had <italic>Gnai2</italic> and <italic>Krt18</italic> AP-2ε peak assignments, suggesting that AP-2ε acts indirectly to regulate these genes. However, since peaks were assigned to the nearest gene, we cannot exclude long-distance gene regulation through enhancer regions as a contributor. CUT&amp;RUN peaks of ectopic mutants were largely similar to that of WTs, while only background peaks were found in <italic>Tfap2e</italic> KOs. Notably, our data suggests that ectopic expression of <italic>Tfap2e</italic> in apical neurons allows for access of AP-2ε to the promoter of apical-enriched genes as they are in the euchromatic state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the results of our study indicate that <italic>Tfap2e</italic> has some features of a terminal selector gene. In fact, <italic>Tfap2e</italic> plays roles in controlling the expression or expression levels of several basal-enriched VSN genes and repressing apical ones, which is necessary for normal basal VSN functions that mediate territorial and sex preference behaviors in mice. We recently found that the establishment of the apical/basal identity is a slow and multistep process, and that the apical/basal identity is primarily established by Notch signaling as soon as the cells become postmitotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Katreddi et al., 2022</xref>). In line with this, we observed that after ectopic <italic>Tfap2e</italic> expression in maturing apical neurons the core of their default apical identity is maintained, however some of the genes normally expressed in alternative basal identity are turned on in apical neurons. Our data suggest that after <italic>Tfap2e</italic> expression, the apical VSNs acquire an ambiguous transcriptome identity as ectopic expression is sufficient to bypass some layers of cellular plasticity restrictions over time. These changes translate into a reduced functionality of the apical neurons, rather than into a transdifferentiation to basal VSNs. The genetic changes induced by ectopic <italic>Tfap2e</italic> further manifest in a progressive disorganization of the vomeronasal neuroepithelium like that reported in aging animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wilson and Raisman, 1980</xref>).</p><p>Our study suggests that as previously hypothesized by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hobert and Kratsios, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rahe and Hobert, 2019</xref>), aberrant expression of terminal selector genes in postnatal neurons can alter the transcriptomic identity of neurons, organization neuroepithelia, and potentially lead to neuropathologies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All reviewers were enthusiastic about the manuscript, but also noted that some additional evidence is required to support key conclusions.</p><p>(1) All three reviewers noted that expression of vomeronasal receptors and signaling proteins, like G proteins, are not generally examined throughout the manuscript. Since receptors/G proteins are the key functional expression differences between apical/basal neurons, their expression should be examined in all key experiments, including Figure 1, Figure 5, and Figure 6.</p><p>(2) Please pay particular attention to comments 1 and 2 of Reviewer #2 and comment 2 about pS6 data of Reviewer #3.</p><p>You will also note that the reviewers have several other comments related to solidifying conclusions in the comments below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Throughout the manuscript, the authors omit analysis of key functional genes that discriminate apical and basal layers, with the exception of V2R2. In (1) AP-2e knockout mice, (2) basal rescue, and (3) OMP-Cre rescue, it is critical to quantify the number of cells expressing Gi2, Go, and a much larger number of V1Rs, V2Rs, and FPRs. This is needed in almost every figure. (A) How much of the sensory receptor repertoire is governed by AP-2e status? (B) In Figure 1 and Figure 6 (and all other related UMAP analyses), it is critical to show expression of functional apical/basal markers like Gi2 and Go. Are cells really 'reprogrammed' if the receptors and signal transduction elements are not changed?</p><p>2) On a related note, Figure 2N indicates a mild 2-fold reduction in V2R2 expression. Why is that sufficient to alter behavior? V2R2 is a broadly expressed V2R – are there other V2Rs that are more substantially impacted?</p><p>3) In figure 6, the 'reprogrammed cells' do not appear to be re-clustered in the UMAP plot, as they occupy the same position in UMAP space but are just colored differently (which I assume is the expression of one gene). The apical and basal character instead needs to be defined by the expressed receptor; where are V1Rs and V2Rs in these UMAP plots, and is their expression altered in AP-2e mutants?</p><p>4) In Figure 1, VSNs were isolated from OMP-Cre mice. Yet, OMP is only expressed in mature sensory neurons; how is it possible that other early-stage cells were obtained?</p><p>5) Are any receptor genes direct targets of AP-2e, and how does it correlate with changes in receptor expression across AP-2e mutants?</p><p>6) In Figure 4, the number of cells not the area labeled is the relevant measure.</p><p>7) Odor preference is not odor discrimination. The authors make claims about mice distinguishing male/female urine, but the behavioral assay needed for that (an odor dishabituation test) is not used. It would be surprising if mice could not distinguish male/female urine since the MOE can also detect sex-specific volatiles.</p><p>8) Sample sizes need to be reported for all experiments- it looks like 4 mice were used for 3D?</p><p>9) The manuscript should be extensively edited for language and precision.</p><p>10) Figure 6: it is not clear what the difference is between A', A', and A'.</p><p>11) Apical vs basal VNO are distinguished by the types of chemicals they detect: V1Rs detect sulfated steroids while FPRs and V2Rs detect peptides. While some V1Rs detect sulfated estrogens, the idea that female odors preferentially activate apical VNOs is rather coarse (Touhara reported a female-specific activator of basal VNOs too, for example in Nature 2005).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In general, I find the experiments well designed, rigorously executed, and producing results of general interest (meaning beyond olfaction). I think there are a few points they need to clean up:</p><p>1. Not surprisingly, considering the timing of the ectopic AP2-epsilon induction, apical VSNs that now adopt a Vmn2R fate, are still projecting to their original territory of the accessory olfactory bulb. This suggests that apical VSNs that respond to inappropriate stimuli activate regions of the bulb that should elicit different responses. In this vein, it is weird that these mice have normal behavioral responses. One explanation would be that the transformed VSNs do not send signals to the brain because the Vmn2R signaling pathway cannot function properly in the transformed neurons. Alternatively, upstream wiring changes may be responsible for the normal behavioral responses. It would be very informative for the understanding of this phenotype for the authors to provide some measure of ligand-induced activity in the OBs of these mice compared to control mice.</p><p>2. Although I commend the authors for their efforts to functionally characterize AP2-epsilon binding by CUT&amp;RUN, this analysis is missing important controls. First, CUT&amp;RUN has a tendency to provide false positives, as any accessible region gives some signal regardless of whether the transcription factor is actually bound. The fact that AP2 motifs are the most significantly enriched in this dataset is a good sign for specificity, but it does not really reveal if individual peaks are specific or not. Thus, the authors need to provide control CUT&amp;RUN experiments from the AP2-epsilon KO mice. Further, and rather more importantly, in order to evaluate whether ectopically expressed AP2-epsilon can access binding sites in apical cells that constitute its targets in the basal cells, the authors need a direct comparison between wild type AP2-epsilon CUT&amp;RUN in basal cells vs ectopic AP2-epsilon CUT&amp;RUN in apical cells.</p><p>3. The authors should explore the effects of AP2-epsilon expression in olfactory neurons as it is possible that cellular transformation in the main olfactory epithelium contributes to the behavioral phenotype (or the lack of a behavioral change). Also they should show whether V1Rs and their signaling components are still expressed in the transformed VSNs.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The authors have examined the molecular markers of basal and apical VSNn in ectopic AP-2e and control animals using scNRA-seq, IHC, and in situ experiments. However, they did not show the changes of V1Rs and V2Rs that can be achieved by bulk RNA-seq and in situ using specific receptor probes. Although AP-2e may not directly bind to the VR genomic regions as revealed by the CUT &amp; RUN results, expression of VRs can be regulated by other AP-2e targets. This is very critical as the receptors directly detect the sex-specific odorants, which is also related to the following point.</p><p>2) I suggest moving Figure 3 to the end and merging with Figure 7 to a single figure or two figures with one having behavioral data and the other having pS6 activation results. Meanwhile, the pS6 activation experiments from the following animals are needed to interpret the behavioral data: (1) male AP-2e KO, AP-2e rescue, and littermate controls to female and male soiled bedding; (2) male ectopic AP-2e and littermate controls to female soiled bedding; (3) female ectopic AP-2e and littermate controls to male soiled bedding. Quantification of the above activation experiments and receptor changes (see point 1) could help to link the molecular data with the behavioral data.</p><p>3) The authors stated that ectopic expression of AP-2e in apical VSNs turns on expression of some basa VSN markers. However, the current evidence for this statement is not very convincing. Co-staining of AP-2e, basal VSN markers (Gαo or V2R2 or some V2Rs marked by receptor probe mix), and apical VSN marker (Gai or Meis2 or some V1Rs marked by receptor probe mix) in ectopic AP-2e and littermate controls would elucidate whether the basal VSN marker genes are indeed turned on in apical VSNs.</p><p>4) The authors used different words and possibly different genotypes (controls/wild-type/OMP-Cre+/-) in the main text and figures when referring to control animals.

The extent of reprogramming seems rather subtle across the functional repertoire of the VNO. I am still confused why there are changes in behavior, and changes in apical neuron responsiveness (6E/F) if the vomeronasal receptor repertoire and signaling components are unchanged. This leads me to worry about the quality of behavioral experiments. The key evidence of a behavioral change is in Figure 6G, as 6H provides only negative data. Furthermore, 6G has a p value &gt; 0.05; the phrase 'non-significant reduction' is misleading and should not be used.

However, we only see significant changes in expression of genes belonging to the Vmn2r C-family (Figure 4 —figure supplement 2). The most obvious expression changes are for Vmn2r7, notably we also found that low mRNA levels for Vmn2r7 can be found in some apical VSNs of controls. Due to the variability in expression among a limited number of analyzed cells we do not know if the expression of other Vmn2r also change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(B) In Figure 1 and Figure 6 (and all other related UMAP analyses), it is critical to show expression of functional apical/basal markers like Gi2 and Go.</p></disp-quote><p>We added Gai2 and Gao in Figure 1. The new version of figure 1 gives a much more complete description of the gene expression of the two main types of VSNs. In old Figure 6 now Figure 7 we included Gai2 and Gao in the heatmap (Figure 7C). Gnao1 is significantly upregulated, but Gai2 has no difference in mRNA expression, reinforcing the idea that, even after ectopic tfap2e, apical VSNs retain the expression of many of their default genes. We now added a new Figure 4 where we visualize the upregulation of Gao in apical cells via RNAscope.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are cells really 'reprogrammed' if the receptors and signal transduction elements are not changed?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting and philosophical point. We believe that our Sc-Seq data (figure 4, 7, Figure 4 —figure supplement 2, Figure 4 —figure supplement 3, Figure 7 —figure supplement 1) support the conclusion that ectopic expression of tfap2e is sufficient to turn on a considerable number of genes normally enriched the basal cell type transcriptome only and to downregulate apical genes. Therefore ectopic tfap2e changes the transcriptome/program of these cells.</p><p>The current idea, mostly driven by Hobert’s lab, is that differentiated neurons cannot be reprogrammed as the chromatin modifications prevent that from happening. Our data indicate that after tfap2e expression we turn on programs that normally are not active in apical neurons, therefore we do, to a certain extent, reprogram the neurons. This reprogramming however does not seem to be sufficient to induce a transdifferentiation. In fact, the apical VSNs that express basal genes still retain the expression of most of their original apical identity genes, including V1Rsignal transduction machinery( Figure 4; Fig6, Figure 4 —figure supplement 2), and guidance receptors (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1) but with the addition of several basal enriched genes (see Figure 7, Supplementary files 1 and 2, Figure 6 —figure supplement 1). These data are in line with newly published observations that suggest that the initiation of the two alternative apical and basal programs is established prior to AP-2e expression (Katreddi et al., 2022).</p><p>To better visualize that the cells change their transcriptopme after AP-2e expression, we now added a correlation plot (Figure 7 —figure supplement 1). This shows that while in controls we have sets of genes that correlate in their expression in either apical or basal VSNs, in the mutants, we lose part of the cell type specific correlation.</p><p>Please, note that the conclusion of our paper is not that tfap2e turns the apical neurons in basal neurons but that tfap2e is a key player in defining the basal identity and that dysregulation of a TF can alter the transcriptome of differentiated neurons. In this paper we identified several previously unreported basal markers. We see significant changes in those as well as changes in some of the markers with role in controlling signal transduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) On a related note, Figure 2N indicates a mild 2-fold reduction in V2R2 expression. Why is that sufficient to alter behavior?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question that is hard to answer unless we did single cell sequencing of WT and KO, we believe that this could be addressed somewhere else. However, we previously published that tfap2e loss of function leads to a progressive degeneration of the basal VSNs. In figure 2 we used V2R2 as a classic marker to show the phenotype: less V2R cells in the KO, thinner basal layer. The V2R2 antibody broadly recognizes the family C of V2r receptors, and thus gives a broad readout of general V2r expression.</p><p>Moreover, we previously showed that without tfap2e some basal VSNs start to express apical genes (Lin et al., 2018). We never stated that the defective behavior of tfap2eKOs (Figure 3) is a result of the sole V2R reduction. As tfap2e controls multiple basal genes it is very likely that the behavioral deficiencies we observe on the KOs, which are clear and significant (Figure 3), might result from mis regulations of multiple genes which translate in a pathological state of the basal neurons.</p><p>The point of this experiment, in the narrative of the article, is to shows that reintroducing tfap2e is sufficient to partially restore the tissue homeostasis (FIGURE 2 D,D’,G,J,M) and to reach a functional response to male pheromones (Figure 3). This experiment shows (a) that our R26AP2e mouse works, (b) that exogenous tfap2e is functional. So, whatever is the actual mechanism or mechanisms determining degeneration and reduced response basal VSNs to male stimuli in the KO are rescued.</p><p>We show simultaneous changes in multiple markers and a general reduction of the basal population in Tfap2e KOs that, in combination, result in the behavioral defects. We show in the rescue that the number of cells expressing these markers is partially restored and that this is sufficient to rescues the behavioral phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>V2R2 is a broadly expressed V2R – are there other V2Rs that are more substantially impacted?</p></disp-quote><p>Our previous RNA seq data from the KOs did not show loss of specific V2R. However, by analyzing our sc-seq data from ectopic mice we noticed that, in these, most of the upregulated V2Rs belong to the family-C.</p><p>To show this we now generated a dot plot comparing Vmn2r expression of control apical and ectopic (Figure 4 —figure supplement 2). Interestingly our data suggest that a small percentage of apical VSNs can express low levers of Vmn2r of the C-family. However, we do not have any evidence that these are directly upregulated by tfap2e. Moreover, our data indicate that even though Vmn2r expression is significantly increased in apical neurons after ectopic tfap2e, the cells that express Vmn2r are only a fraction of all the apical VSNs.</p><p>The fact that we see upregulation of V2R of the c-family is likely due to the fact that they are represented enough to reach significance. In order to analyze the expression of multiple V2R we would have to largely increase the number of sequenced cells, this is a very expensive experiment that we could develop in a follow-up story focused on this specific aspect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In figure 6, the 'reprogrammed cells' do not appear to be re-clustered in the UMAP plot, as they occupy the same position in UMAP space but are just colored differently (which I assume is the expression of one gene). The apical and basal character instead needs to be defined by the expressed receptor; where are V1Rs and V2Rs in these UMAP plots, and is their expression altered in AP-2e mutants?</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 6, now Figure 7 the UMPAS in A’-B’’’ show the normal and ectopic expression of tfap2e (red) in control and mutants with respect to Meis2 (blue), we increased the size of the font in the figure to make that visible.­ Moreover we made the overlap more visible. Tfap2e and Meis2 are early and reliable markers for the apical basal lineages (see Figure 4 A1,D1 and Figure 5). These two transcription factors are expressed in mutually exclusive way before Ga0 and Gai2 expression fully segregates. We better characterized this in a recently published article (Katreddi R.R. et al., Development 2022)</p><p>We generated a new supplementary figure (Figure 4 —figure supplement 2) with volcano plot and a dot plot showing the percentage of cells expressing V2Rs in control apical and mutant apical VSNs (Figure 4 —figure supplement 2).

In fact, the apical clusters of the controls and of the tfap2e ectopic do not occupy the same position in the UMAP. To make that more visible we now generated a new version of Figure 6 now Figure 7, (See Figure 7 A’’’’; B’’’’ and A+B’’’’) where we show the UMAP of controls in gray, the UMAP of OMPCreR26AP2e in magenta and an overlay to show segregation of the mature apical populations in the two genotype. As shown in the merged UMAP the apical neurons of controls and mutants do not occupy the same position in the UMAP space.</p><p>Notably, the heat map (Figure 7C), which is more informative and detailed than the feature map, shows that the apical neurons of mice with ectopic tfap2e still express most of the apical genes including Gai2 (Supplementary file 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 1, VSNs were isolated from OMP-Cre mice.

We tried to do cell counts after immunostaining, but we found that the complex patterning of Gαo expression in the epithelium and the variability in immunoreactivity across cells made it difficult to quantify cells in a reliable way. In the new version of the article, we kept the area percentage of tissue reactive for ISH Figure 4G.

While some V1Rs detect sulfated estrogens, the idea that female odors preferentially activate apical VNOs is rather coarse (Touhara reported a female-specific activator of basal VNOs too, for example in Nature 2005).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the above-mentioned reference. Nonetheless in our hands, as illustrated in the graph (new Figure 6), we do see, regardless of the sex, a clear bias in the activation of apical VSNs after exposure to female soiled bedding. Both tfap2e ectopic males and females showed reduction in apical VSNs activation in response to female urines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In general, I find the experiments well designed, rigorously executed, and producing results of general interest (meaning beyond olfaction). I think there are a few points they need to clean up:</p><p>1. Not surprisingly, considering the timing of the ectopic AP2-epsilon induction, apical VSNs that now adopt a Vmn2R fate, are still projecting to their original territory of the accessory olfactory bulb. This suggests that apical VSNs that respond to inappropriate stimuli activate regions of the bulb that should elicit different responses. In this vein, it is weird that these mice have normal behavioral responses. One explanation would be that the transformed VSNs do not send signals to the brain because the Vmn2R signaling pathway cannot function properly in the transformed neurons. Alternatively, upstream wiring changes may be responsible for the normal behavioral responses. It would be very informative for the understanding of this phenotype for the authors to provide some measure of ligand-induced activity in the OBs of these mice compared to control mice.</p></disp-quote><p>By analyzing the gross connectivity of the mice with ectopic AP2-epsilon we did not see obvious changes: apical VSNs projected to the anterior while basal to the posterior AOB (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1). These data suggest that after tfap2e ectopic expression the core of the apical identity is not lost. However, though, in ectopic mice, we found a reduction in the number of activated v1r VSNs in response to female odorants (Fig6C,D,F) we could still find c-Fos activation in the AOB. These data suggest that ectopic tfap2e only partially compromises the functionality of the apical neurons. So, even with ectopic expression of some basal genes, a sufficient number of apical neurons appears to be able to detect, and transduce signals to the brain and to trigger “normal” behaviors in response to stimuli. More details are now provided in new Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Although I commend the authors for their efforts to functionally characterize AP2-epsilon binding by CUT&amp;RUN, this analysis is missing important controls. First, CUT&amp;RUN has a tendency to provide false positives, as any accessible region gives some signal regardless of whether the transcription factor is actually bound. The fact that AP2 motifs are the most significantly enriched in this dataset is a good sign for specificity, but it does not really reveal if individual peaks are specific or not. Thus, the authors need to provide control CUT&amp;RUN experiments from the AP2-epsilon KO mice. Further, and rather more importantly, in order to evaluate whether ectopically expressed AP2-epsilon can access binding sites in apical cells that constitute its targets in the basal cells, the authors need a direct comparison between wild type AP2-epsilon CUT&amp;RUN in basal cells vs ectopic AP2-epsilon CUT&amp;RUN in apical cells.</p></disp-quote><p>In the new version of the manuscript, we added new CUT&amp;RUN data obtained from knockout cells and cells from ectopic expressors Figure 7, and Figure 7 —figure supplement 2. These data indicate that the identified peaks were not false positives. In fact, even though we found some peaks in the TFAP2E KO datasets, these appeared to be largely localized to centromeres/telomeres/repetitive regions. These peaks, that did not overlap with the previously identified peaks in WT animals were now used as 'background' peak.</p><p>CUT&amp;RUN from ectopic expressors gave tracks that largely overlap with those of the WT controls (Figure 7; Figure 7 —figure supplement 2). However, plotting the signals at the promoter of apical and basal enriched genes for WT, AP-2e KO and AP-2e ectopic expressors we found more signal at the apical-enriched promoters in the ectopic mice dataset. This data suggests that ectopic expression of AP-2e in apical neurons facilitates its access to the promoter of apical enriched genes as these are normally active in the apical neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors should explore the effects of AP2-epsilon expression in olfactory neurons as it is possible that cellular transformation in the main olfactory epithelium contributes to the behavioral phenotype (or the lack of a behavioral change). Also they should show whether V1Rs and their signaling components are still expressed in the transformed VSNs.</p></disp-quote><p>The single cell seq data indicate that after ectopic Ap-2e there is no significant change in V1Rs expression (at least as mRNAs) between controls and mutants (Figure 4 —figure supplement 2, supplementary file 2). This is the same for Gai2 that however in the VSNs of ectopic animals is, in some cells, co-expressed with Gao. (Figure 4). Based on these observations together with the fact that the mutants’ apical neurons, project to the anterior AOB (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1), and still detect and transduce the signals (Figure 6), we can extrapolate that the apical neurons still express their signaling machinery.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) The authors have examined the molecular markers of basal and apical VSNn in ectopic AP-2e and control animals using scNRA-seq, IHC, and in situ experiments. However, they did not show the changes of V1Rs and V2Rs that can be achieved by bulk RNA-seq and in situ using specific receptor probes. Although AP-2e may not directly bind to the VR genomic regions as revealed by the CUT &amp; RUN results, expression of VRs can be regulated by other AP-2e targets. This is very critical as the receptors directly detect the sex-specific odorants, which is also related to the following point.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this data, we added supplementary data analyzing the expression of V1R and V2Rs. By analyzing the expression level across apical cells of controls and mutants we do not see significant changes/loss of in V1Rs, suggestive of the fact that AP-2e levels do not (directly or not) change V1Rs expression (Figure 4 —figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I suggest moving Figure 3 to the end and merging with Figure 7 to a single figure or two figures with one having behavioral data and the other having pS6 activation results.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion, we made some changes in the figure organization that we think go well with the narrative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Meanwhile, the pS6 activation experiments from the following animals are needed to interpret the behavioral data: (1) male AP-2e KO, AP-2e rescue, and littermate controls to female and male soiled bedding; (2) male ectopic AP-2e and littermate controls to female soiled bedding; (3) female ectopic AP-2e and littermate controls to male soiled bedding.

A statement explicitly stating this has been added to the manuscript at lines: 768-769.

In fact, as explained in the methods test subjects were housed with intact females for at least one week prior to testing.

Females were removed immediately before testing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More concerning, the knockout phenotype is not VNO-specific and could very well be due to other physiological or neuronal changes in these mice.</p></disp-quote><p>The statement is correct, the AP2eKO is a full KO. However, we previously explored Cre lineage tracing showing very limited AP2e expression to the VNO and subsets of mitral cells. Moreover, we have previously published that without AP2e the basal VSNs degenerate in a similar fashion to what reported for Gao, Ggamma8, TRPC2 KOs. So, vit a progressive loss of V2R+ neurons a reduction in basal VSNs dependent behavior (e.g. aggressive behavior), was expected. If the behavioral changes that we observed are solely dependent on AP2e LOF in the VNO is a point that we cannot resolve here.</p><p>However, we observed that re-expressing AP2e using our new R26AP2e mouse line was sufficient to (a) restore the basal VSNs (b) rescue the aggressive behavior. This experiment was mostly intended to validate our R26 model and the biological functionality of the R26Ap2e model.</p></body></sub-article></article>
