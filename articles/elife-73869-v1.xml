Here, we show how aquatic animals (i.e. carp, crabs, and softshell turtles) benefit paddy ecosystems when cocultured with rice. Three separate field experiments and three separate mesocosm experiments were conducted. Each experiment included a rice monoculture (RM) treatment and a rice-aquatic animal (RA) coculture treatment; RA included feed addition for aquatic animals. In the field experiments, rice yield was higher with RA than with RM, and RA also produced aquatic animal yields that averaged 0.52–2.57 t ha<sup>-1</sup>. Compared to their corresponding RMs, the three RAs had significantly higher apparent nitrogen (N)-use efficiency and lower weed infestation, while soil N contents were stable over time. Dietary reconstruction analysis based on <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>15</sup>N showed that 16.0–50.2% of aquatic animal foods were from naturally occurring organisms in the rice fields. Stable-isotope-labeling (<sup>13</sup>C) in the field experiments indicated that the organic matter decomposition rate was greater with RA than with RM. Isotope <sup>15</sup>N labeling in the mesocosm experiments indicated that rice used 13.0–35.1% of the aquatic animal feed-N. All these results suggest that rice-aquatic animal coculture increases food production, increases N-use efficiency, and maintains soil N content by reducing weeds and promoting decomposition and complementary N use. Our study supports the view that adding species to monocultures may enhance agroecosystem functions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Monoculture, where only one type of crop is grown to the exclusion of any other organism, is a pillar of modern agriculture. Yet this narrow focus disregards how complex inter-species interactions can increase crop yield and biodiversity while decreasing the need for fertilizers or pesticides. For example, many farmers across Asia introduce carps, crabs, turtles or other freshwater grazers into their rice paddies. This coculture approach yields promising results but remains poorly understood. In particular, it is unclear how these animals’ behaviours and biological processes benefit the ecosystem.</p><p>To examine these questions, Guo, Zhao et al. conducted three separate four-year field experiments; they compared rice plots inhabited by either carp, mitten crabs or Chinese softshell turtles with fields where these organisms were not present.</p><p>With animals, the rice paddies had less weeds, better crop yields and steady levels of nitrogen (a natural fertiliser) in their soil. These ecosystems could breakdown organic matter faster, use it better and had a reduced need for added fertilizer. While animal feed was provided in the areas that were studied, carp, crabs and turtles obtained up to half their food from the field itself, eating weeds, algae and pests and therefore reducing competition for the crops.</p><p>This work helps to understand the importance of species interactions, showing that diversifying monocultures may boost yields and make agriculture more sustainable.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>paddy ecosystem</kwd><kwd>aquatic animals</kwd><kwd>nitrogen recycling</kwd><kwd>carp</kwd><kwd>crab</kwd><kwd>soft-shell turtle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U21A20184</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100017599</institution-id><institution>Science and Technology Program of Zhejiang Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022C02058</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100017599</institution-id><institution>Science and Technology Program of Zhejiang Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LGN22C030002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Liangliang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31661143001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31770481</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Aquatic animals cocultured with rice in paddy ecosystems can increase food production, improve nitrogen (N)-use efficiency, and maintain soil fertility by reducing weeds, and promoting recycle and complementary use of N.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Biological simplification and reliance on chemicals have increased the concern with the low levels of biodiversity in modern, intensive agriculture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Smith et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kremen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ren et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brooker et al., 2021</xref>).

Researchers have also proposed that facilitation or resource complementarity between species may increase the sustainability of agricultural production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ren et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brooker et al., 2021</xref>). Although an increase in species richness in a natural plant community is expected to result in an increase in plant mass, an increase in species richness in agriculture may not always lead to increases in yield due to competition for light or nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Omer et al., 2007</xref>). Understanding how species may or may not benefit is therefore critical for using species diversity in agriculture.</p><p>Intercropping systems (e.g. the interplanting of corn or wheat with a legume) or the planting of cover crops are examples of the successful use of crop diversity in agriculture. In legume-based cropping systems, legume crops provide intercropped non-legume crops with symbiotically fixed nitrogen (N) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tsialtas et al., 2018</xref>) and with increased phosphorus (P) availability due to the lowering of soil pH by N<sub>2</sub>-fixing bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li et al., 2007</xref>); these effects increase the yield of the intercropped species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li et al., 2007</xref>). Other intercropping systems can increase the diversity of soil microorganisms, natural enemies, and pollinators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cardinale et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kremen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Letourneau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Norris et al., 2018</xref>). Using diverse cover crops can also help reduce soil erosion and greenhouse gas emissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kaye and Quemada, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Because paddy fields provide a shallow water habitat suitable for some aquatic animals (e.g. carp, crabs, and softshell turtles), the coculturing of rice with aquatic animals has been practiced in many countries (e.g. Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Halwart and Gupta, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Frei and Becker, 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed and Garnett, 2011</xref>). Several rice-aquatic animal coculture systems (e.g. rice-carp, rice-crab, and rice-turtle) have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hu et al., 2016</xref>). Field surveys and experiments have shown that these coculture systems can increase rice yields and soil fertility while reducing the need for fertilizers and pesticides compared to rice monoculture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Xie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Guo et al., 2020</xref>). Why coculturing these aquatic animals with rice can reduce the application of fertilizers and pesticides, however, is poorly understood. Understanding how aquatic animals contribute to the reductions in fertilizer and pesticide application in coculture systems would help the development of sustainable rice production.</p><p>Animal behaviors (e.g. moving and grazing) are important drivers of ecosystem processes (e.g. carbon and nutrient cycling, and energy flux) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vanni et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schmitz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">McInturf et al., 2019</xref>). In wetland or aquatic ecosystems, grazing, ‘muddying’, and burrowing by aquatic animals have important roles in nutrient cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vanni, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Thrush et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Devlin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Atkinson et al., 2021</xref>). For paddy ecosystems in which rice and aquatic animals coexist, understanding whether and how the behavior of aquatic animals affects ecosystem processes and functions could help researchers predict the effects of a coculture system of rice and an aquatic animal, and could also help improve the coculture system.</p><p>In this study, we conducted three field experiments and three mesocosm experiments to determine how coculture with aquatic animals benefits a rice paddy ecosystem in terms of productivity, nutrient-use efficiency, and the stability of soil N content. Because some fresh water animals (e.g. carp, crabs, crayfish, and softshell turtles) that are cultured in fish ponds or in paddy fields are omnivores and may use weeds, algae, and phytoplankton as food, we expected that the coculture of these aquatic animals would increase rice yield by reducing competitors of rice. We also expected that the cocultured aquatic animals would promote organic matter decomposition because of their feeding activity and would thereby promote nutrient recycling in the paddy ecosystem. Feed is often applied in the form of pellets to increase the growth of aquatic animals in coculture systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Guo et al., 2020</xref>), and significant percentages of the N in the feed is often unconsumed and unassimilated by the animals. We therefore expected that this unconsumed and unassimilated feed-N could be used by rice plants, resulting in higher N-use efficiency and a more stable soil N content in a coculture system than in a rice monoculture.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Yield, soil N content, and N-use efficiency in the field experiments</title><p>We conducted three 4-year-long field experiments: one with rice-carp, one with rice-crabs, and one with rice-turtles.

The current study provides another example of exploiting positive species interactions in agriculture. In this case, the interactions involve the use of an aquatic animal (i.e. carp, crabs, or turtles) as a partner crop for rice with the goals of stabilizing soil N and increasing the productivity and N-use efficiency of paddy ecosystems.</p><p>The role of animals in ecosystems has been increasingly recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vanni, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dirzo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schmitz et al., 2018</xref>). Animals can mediate carbon exchange between ecosystems, can mediate organic matter transformation within ecosystems, and can also drive nutrient cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schmitz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schmitz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vanni, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">McInturf et al., 2019</xref>). In many aquatic ecosystems, aquatic animals can also significantly affect the plant community, primary productivity, and nutrient availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Attayde and Hansson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vanni, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vanni et al., 2006</xref>). In this study, coculturing with aquatic animals (i.e. carp, crabs, and turtles) increased rice yield and N-use efficiency, and helped maintain soil N compared to the corresponding rice monoculture.</p><p>The aquatic animals had two important roles in these cocultured paddy ecosystems. One role involved competition, that is, aquatic animals reduced competitors (i.e. weeds) of rice plants and thereby enhanced rice yield. Some freshwater animals (e.g. carp, crabs, and crayfish) are omnivores that may consume some living organisms (e.g. weeds, algae, and phytoplankton) that compete with rice plants for nutrients. Carp and crabs, for example, can greatly reduce weeds in rice-carp systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Frei and Becker, 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Xie et al., 2011</xref>) and in rice-crab systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lv et al., 2011</xref>). Our field experiments also showed a reduction (45.3–51.9%) of weeds in the plots with carp, crabs, or turtles compared to the monoculture plots without herbicide use (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Our dietary reconstruction based on stable-isotope data of δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>15</sup>N showed that carp and crabs obtained 34.8–50.2% of their total food from the rice field, including weeds, macro-algae, and phytoplankton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>); these results provide indirect evidence that carp and crabs reduced competitors of rice. Although some freshwater animals (e.g. turtles in our study) do not prefer to feed on weeds and other vegetative food sources, their activities disturb the paddy soil and thereby inhibit weed germination and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">He, 2017</xref>).</p><p>A second role of aquatic animals concerned N, that is, aquatic animals increased the recycling of N in these cocultured paddy ecosystems. Many studies have shown that grazers can accelerate nutrient cycling in natural grassland and freshwater ecosystems by increasing nutrient availability in soil and nutrient-use efficiency of plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McNaughton et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atkinson et al., 2017</xref>). In our study, the carp, crabs, and turtles obtained 50.2, 34.8, and 16.0%, respectively, of their food from the field rather than from the feed although sufficient feed was applied in our experiment to support the aquatic animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Similar to the effects of grazers in the natural ecosystems, the aquatic animals (carp, crabs, and turtles) in the paddy ecosystem foraged on weeds, algae, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and benthic invertebrates that used N directly from the paddy field. Once these food source organisms are ingested, the aquatic animals convert them into biomass, feces, and excretions. Because ammonia represents from 75% to 85% of the N in aquatic animal excretions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Chakraborty and Chakraborty, 1998</xref>), the excretions can be directly utilized by rice plants. The aquatic animal feces may release nutrients once they are decomposed, or they may be stored in the form of soil organic matter. Thus, the promotion of N cycling by aquatic animals apparently explains, at least in part, why N-use efficiency of rice was higher and soil N content was more stable in the rice-aquatic animal coculture plots than in the monoculture plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>In addition to reducing competition and increasing nutrient availability for rice plants via grazing, aquatic animals apparently increased nutrient availability for rice plants by enhancing organic matter decomposition. The percentage of maize leaves (added to the plots in ‘litter tubes’) that remained after 80 days (as indicated by the percentage of <sup>13</sup>C remaining) was significantly lower in the three RA treatments than in the RM treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), indicating that carp, crabs, and turtles promoted organic matter decomposition in the field. Nutrients (e.g. N and P) in the organic matter (e.g. unconsumed feed, aquatic animal feces, and leaf litter) may be released by decomposition and then used by rice plants or other organisms in the field. Our tracing of feed-<sup>15</sup>N demonstrated that 13.0–35.1% of the feed-N was found in the rice plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). These results suggested that the N in unconsumed or unassimilated feed was released via decomposition and was then used by the rice plants.</p><p>Unlike traditional rice-fish coculture systems in which no fish feed is applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Xie et al., 2011</xref>), the current coculture systems, like those described in this study, often include the application of feed in order to obtain high aquatic animal yields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hu et al., 2016</xref>). Whether such feed affects rice yield and soil fertility was also assessed in our study. The mesocosm experiments showed that 1.27 ± 0.09 g m<sup>–2</sup> (rice-carp), 0.36 ± 0.09 g m<sup>–2</sup> (rice-crab), and 1.12 ± 0.10 g.m<sup>–2</sup> (rice-turtle) of feed-<sup>15</sup>N accumulated in the rice plant biomass (grain and straw) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). The mesocosm experiments also showed that feed-<sup>15</sup>N accumulated in the soil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These results suggest that N use by cocultured rice and animals can be complementary and can increase N-use efficiency. The results also suggest that the unconsumed or unassimilated feed can function as a fertilizer for rice and can thereby increase the rice yield and the N content in the soil. In addition to N, phosphorus (P) also entered rice-animal coculture systems <italic>via</italic> feed in our study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table1">Appendix 2—table 1</xref>). Like N, P is important for rice growth and yield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahmed et al., 2017</xref>). In our 4-year field experiments, the level of soil total P was similar at the end vs. the beginning under both rice monocultures and rice-animal cocultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>), but rice yields were higher and more P was removed with the harvested products with coculture than with monoculture (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table2">Appendix 2—table 2</xref>). It follows that the P input via feed may contribute to the rice yield increase and the maintenance of soil P in the coculture systems.</p><p>The current results increase our understanding of how agricultural systems can use species diversity to increase sustainability. Planting diverse wild or crop species in field margins has been found to improve the management of crop pests and their natural enemies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bianchi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tschumi et al., 2016</xref>). Overyielding often occurs in intercropping systems when the coexisting crops benefit each other or when one benefits the others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Snapp et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kremen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ren et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brooker et al., 2021</xref>). In our study, the rice plants and the three aquatic animals (i.e. carp, crabs, and turtles) have a similar growing period and have similar water and temperature requirements, making it possible to develop a rice–aquatic animal partnership. Although carp, crabs, and turtles differ in biological traits and feeding activities, they play similar roles in increasing rice yield and N-use efficiency, and in stabilizing soil N.</p><p>Rice paddies provide food for half of the world’s population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gross and Zhao, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Edzesi et al., 2016</xref>), and also provide other ecosystem services, including groundwater recharge, flood control, water purification, and the conservation of biodiversity, landscapes, and human cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bouman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Natuhara, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Modern rice farming currently faces the great challenge of how to increase yield while minimizing negative environmental effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mueller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). Our study suggests that this challenge can be at least partially met by adding certain species of aquatic animals to rice monocultures. The resulting cocultures could produce more food (rice grain and fish) with less fertilizer and pesticides than rice monocultures. In our field experiment, an average annual aquatic animal yield ranging from 0.52 to 2.57 t ha<sup>–1</sup> was produced from the rice fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), suggesting that local farmers can obtain more income from their paddy fields. Moreover, the prices for grain and aquatic animal products from these cocultures were higher than from the local rice monoculture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hu et al., 2016</xref>). Although costs of the cocultures are higher than the costs of monoculture because of the feed input and increased labor required for the management of two species, net income was still higher for cocultures than for monocultures because of the higher prices of the products and the reduced use of fertilizers and pesticides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Over the last two decades in China, the increased income has greatly increased farmer enthusiasm for the rice–aquatic animal cocultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>While our current study and other previous studies have shown the positive effects of rice-aquatic animal coculture on rice production, farmer income, and soil N, possible negative effects resulting from the input of feed and the increased decomposition rate should be considered. These potential negative effects include eutrophication and increased carbon emission. Previous studies, however, found that rice-aquatic animal coculture would not cause serious N eutrophication in the field when the target aquatic animal yields were set below the following thresholds: 2.11 ± 0.22 t ha<sup>–1</sup> for rice-carp, 0.66 ± 0.08 t ha<sup>–1</sup> for rice-crab, and 3.62 ± 0.25 t ha<sup>–1</sup> for rice-turtle coculture systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hu et al., 2016</xref>). The effects of rice-aquatic animal coculture on carbon emission (e.g. CH<sub>4</sub> emission) varied among reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ding et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sun et al., 2021</xref>). Some experiments indicated that CH<sub>4</sub> emissions were lower in rice–aquatic animal coculture systems than in rice monocultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yuan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sun et al., 2021</xref>), while other experiments indicated that CH<sub>4</sub> emissions were higher in rice–aquatic animal coculture systems than in rice monocultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Frei and Becker, 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). These differences in CH<sub>4</sub> emission could be caused by differences in aquatic animals, natural environments, and field management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ding et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dai et al., 2022</xref>). In our study, the aquatic animals increased organic matter decomposition in the paddy field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that the release of nutrients but also of CO<sub>2</sub> would be higher with coculture than with monoculture.</p><p>In our previous survey, the three typical types of coculture (i.e. rice-carp, rice-crab, and rice-turtle) were compared in terms of financial returns for the farmers. Financial returns were higher for rice-turtle systems (which is the most common type of coculture in south China) than for rice-carp and rice-crab systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).

In some areas, farmers apply feed to obtain higher animal yield from the cocultures, and the main components of the feed are residues of soybean after the oil has been extracted. Given the millions of hectares of rice fields with suitable conditions for rice-aquatic animal coculture, the cropland available for soybean production and the integration of rice-aquatic animal coculture with soybean production should be taken into account before substantial increases in coculture area are promoted.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>The rice–aquatic animal coculture systems in the study</title><p>Three coculture systems, namely rice-carp, rice-crab, and rice-turtle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), were studied.

In these systems, the aquatic animals (i.e. carp, crabs, and softshell turtles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) are partnered with rice plants during the whole rice-growing period (130–150 days) and are harvested every year when the rice matures. These three aquatic animals are economically important, and are usually cultured in fish ponds or paddy fields by local farmers. The meat of all these species is a popular food of the local people. To increase the growth and quality of aquatic animals in coculture systems, farmers often apply feed in the form of pellets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table1">Appendix 2—table 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Illustration of the field experiments.</title><p>The rice plants and carp (<bold>A</bold>), crab (<bold>B</bold>), and turtle (<bold>C</bold>) were photographed in the corresponding experimental plots (<bold>D</bold>, <bold>E</bold>, and <bold>F</bold>), which were arranged in completely randomized blocks in three rice-planting areas in Qingtian County (<bold>G</bold>), Panshan County (<bold>H</bold>), and Deqing County (<bold>I</bold>), respectively. The red circle in A indicates a rice hill. Photos of A, B and C were taken by Lufeng Zhao, Zhiming Li and Genlian Wang, respectively.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-73869-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The common carp (<italic>Cyprinus carpio</italic>) has adapted to paddy habitats and is predominantly used for rice-carp coculture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Xie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). The growing season for rice-carp systems is usually from late May to early October (ca. 125 days). Carp fry (ca. 40 g each) are often released into the rice field 1 week after rice is transplanted. The carp, which do not feed on rice plants, live in the paddy field until the rice plants are mature, at which time the carp are harvested. In the current study, pellet feed (5.37% N) was applied each day at ca. 6:30 am. The daily amount of feed was initially set as 4% of the fish fresh weight and was increased by 3% every 10 days afterwards. By carp harvest, the total inputs of the feed and feed-N for RA plots were 1.46 t ha<sup>–1</sup> and 78.41 kg ha<sup>–1</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table1">Appendix 2—table 1</xref>). After they are harvested from paddy fields, the carp are directly used as food or are temporary cultured in fish ponds until they are used as food.</p><p>The Chinese mitten crab (<italic>Eriocheir sinensis</italic> Milne-Edwards) is used in the rice-crab system and is also well adapted to the paddy environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). In the rice-crab system, the growing season is from middle May to middle October (ca. 150 days). The juvenile crabs (ca. 1.15 g each) are released into rice fields 1 week after rice is transplanted. The juvenile crabs do not feed on rice plants and ‘live’ together with rice plants until harvest. The crabs molt several times during their time in the paddy field. In the current study, pellet feed (4.52% N) was applied once each day at ca. 6:30 am. The daily amount of feed was initially set as 3–5% of the crab fresh weight and was increased by 3% every 10 days afterwards. By crab harvest, the total inputs of the feed and feed-N for RA plots were 1.78 t ha<sup>–1</sup> and 80.46 kg ha<sup>–1</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table1">Appendix 2—table 1</xref>). After they are harvested from the paddy fields, the crabs are used as food or are placed in ponds and are used as a source of crabs for the next year.</p><p>The Chinese softshell turtle (<italic>Pelodiscus sinensis</italic>) is often cultured in paddy fields by local farmers in southeastern China (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The turtles are omnivores but prefer animal diets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">He, 2017</xref>). In this rice-turtle system, the growing season is from middle June to early November (ca. 140 days). The baby turtles (ca. 150 g each) are released into the field 1 week after rice is transplanted. The turtles remain with the rice plants for the whole rice-growth period. In the current study, pellet feed (6.51% N) was applied twice per day at ca. 7:00 am and 5:00 pm throughout the coculture period. The daily amount of feed was initially set as 0.5%–1.0% of the turtle fresh weight but was increased as the turtles grew. By turtle harvest, the total inputs of the feed and feed-N for RA plots were 1.62 t ha<sup>–1</sup> and 105.46 kg ha<sup>–1</sup>, respectively.

After they are harvested from paddy fields, the turtles are used as food or are temporarily cultured in fish ponds until they are used as food.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>In the following experiments, the samples of all aquatic animals (i.e. carp, crabs, and softshell turtles) were collected and measured in accordance with the approved guidelines of the Zhejiang University Experimental Animal Management Committee (reference number SYXK(Zhe)2018–0016). Details on the handling of animal samples were described in the Methods section.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Field experiments</title><p>Each of three field experiments (one each for rice-carp, rice-crab, and rice-turtle systems) was conducted for 4 years (2017–2020) at a site (one system per site) where the particular system was widely practiced. The three sites are described in the supporting information (see Appendix 3).</p><p>All three experiments used a completely randomized block design with two treatments: rice monoculture (RM) and rice-aquatic animal coculture (RA) with feed addition for aquatic animal (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table1">Appendix 2—table 1</xref>). Each treatment at each site was represented by six replicate plots with a size of 0.01 ha per plot for rice-carp and rice-crabs, and 80 m<sup>2</sup> per plot for rice-turtles. No chemicals were used to control weeds, pests, or diseases during the experiments. The plot size and detailed experimental procedures are described in Appendix 4.</p><p>In 2018, the stable-isotope <sup>13</sup>C labeling method was used to determine the organic matter decomposition rate in the three field experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Cheng et al., 2012</xref>). ‘Litter tubes’ containing maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic> L.) leaves enriched with <sup>13</sup>C (δ<sup>13</sup>C –13.6‰) were used as described in Appendix 5. The percentage of <sup>13</sup>C remaining in the litter tubes after 40 and 80 days represented the decomposition rate.</p><p>We used a stable isotope (<sup>13</sup>C and <sup>15</sup>N) technique to determine how the aquatic animals (i.e. carp, crabs, or turtles) used food resources (e.g. weeds, zoobenthos, zooplankton, and phytoplankton) in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Michener and Schell, 1994</xref>). During the rice growing period in 2019, we collected living organisms that were consumed by the aquatic animals in each of the three experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Caut et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Guo et al., 2016</xref>) (see Appendix 6). Before and after the experiments, we also collected muscles from the aquatic animals (carp, crabs, or turtles) (see Appendix 7).</p><p>We ground all dried samples of food sources and aquatic animals and analyzed their isotopic δ value and content (<sup>13</sup>C and <sup>15</sup>N). The δ value was calculated as ([R<sub>sample</sub> /R<sub>standard</sub>]−1) × 1000, where R represents <sup>13</sup>C:<sup>12</sup>C or <sup>15</sup>N:<sup>14</sup>N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Peterson and Fry, 1987</xref>). Dietary contributions of input feed and potential food sources from the rice field were analyzed by stable isotopic dietary reconstruction with the R package ‘siar’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Phillips and Gregg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Phillips et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Parnell and Jackson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">R Core Team, 2021</xref>). The discrimination factors of <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>15</sup>N for carp, crabs, and turtles in dietary reconstruction were previously determined (see Appendix 8).</p><p>Three weeks before rice was harvested in each experimental year (from 2017 to 2020), 5 quadrats (1 m<sup>2</sup>) were randomly placed in each plot to evaluate weed infestation. For each quadrat, the aboveground dry weed biomass was measured.</p><p>In each experimental year (from 2017 to 2020), rice and aquatic animals were harvested from the whole experimental plots when rice plants matured. Rice yield was determined by manually harvesting entire plots. Rice grain was air-dried and weighed. Rice yield was estimated as tons of air-dried grain per ha. One week before rice was harvested, aquatic animals were collected from entire plots by driving them into the corner of field as the water was drained. Yield was expressed as tons of fresh aquatic animal biomass per ha.</p><p>At harvest in each year of the experiments, samples of rice plants and aquatic animals were collected for determining N content. Five hills of rice were collected in each plot. The separated grain and straw were oven-dried at &lt;65℃ to a constant weight. The aquatic animal samples were kept in water for 24 hr to permit the emptying of intestinal contents. The clean aquatic animal samples were oven-dried at 105℃ to a constant weight. Both rice and aquatic animal samples were ground with a ball mill (RETSCHMM 400, Germany). The N content in rice straw and grain and in the aquatic animals was measured by the Kjeldahl method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bremmer and Mulvaney, 1982</xref>).</p><p>Every experimental year, soil samples (0–20 cm depth) were collected immediately after harvest from each plot.

N<sub>y</sub> was determined by multiplying the biomass of rice (grain and straw) and aquatic animals by the percentage of N in rice and aquatic animals. We assumed that the natural N input (e.g. N fixed by bacteria, N in the irrigation water, and atmospheric N deposition) was similar between RM and RA plots, and natural N input was therefore not included in our estimations of ANUE.</p><p>Statistical analysis was conducted using the GLM in SPSS (V.20.0, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_002865">SCR_002865</ext-link>). All data were subjected to a homogeneity test. If the data did not meet the assumptions of normality and homogeneity, they were log-transformed before analysis. For each field experiment, ANOVAs with a split-plot design (i.e. treatment RM and RA as the main plots and experimental years as the sub-plots) were performed on rice yields, total soil N content, ANUE, and weed biomass. For RM or RA plots, total N in the soil at the beginning and end of the experiment were compared by using paired <italic>t</italic>-tests (SPSS V.20.0, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_002865">SCR_002865</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Mesocosm experiments</title><p>To determine whether unconsumed and unassimilated feed-N is used by aquatic animals in rice-carp, rice-crab, or rice-turtle systems, we conducted three independent mesocosm experiments (one for each kind of system) at the Experimental Station of Zhejiang University in Deqing County, Zhejiang Province (30°33′N, 119°32′E.). The mesocosm experiments were conducted in 2019. The fate of feed-N was traced by using stable-isotope <sup>15</sup>N-labeled feed in each mesocosm experiment.</p><p>For rice-carp and rice-crab experiments, each mesocosm was a cylindrical, 1017 L plastic stock tank. Intact soil (300 L) from a corresponding rice field was added to each mesocosm to a depth of 30 cm. The mesocosms were placed in a rice paddy field (the corresponding fields that were used for the three field experiments) so that their bottoms were 20 cm below the soil surface, and the top of each microcosm was above the water line. For the rice-turtle system, 2 m × 2 m plots were established in a rice paddy field. Each plot had an independent water inlet and outlet and was separated from water mixing by concrete ridges.</p><p>Each of the three mesocosm experiments had a completely randomized block design with six replicate blocks. The treatments were rice monoculture (RM) and rice-aquatic animals coculture (RA). For the RM and RA, varieties of rice and aquatic animal species were the same as in the field experiment. The detailed procedures for each mesocosm experiment are provided in Appendix 9.</p><p>Because soybean is the major raw ingredient of feeds for the three aquatic animals (carp, crabs, and turtles), we first labeled soybean powder with <sup>15</sup>N (see Appendix 10).

The authors aimed to compare rice monocultures to co-cultures of rice and an aquatic animal (carp, crab, or turtle). The data analyses appear adequate, though I do request the degrees of freedom for F-tests to double check that the repeated measures analysis was properly implemented. The findings are of widespread importance, given that rice is one of the most widely consumed crops worldwide. Increasing the yield of rice through co-culture may reduce the demand of land for rice production, leaving more land for non-human species.</p><p>I have two main suggestions for the authors, which I hope will help further improve their manuscript. First, it is necessary to clarify in visible places, including the Abstract, that feed was added in co-culture. This confounds, to some extent, the extra nutrient inputs in the feed with the comparisons between monocultures and co-cultures. It might also help to include further discussion of the extent to which the increased rice yield is likely explained by each of these two things: the animals or the nutrient inputs in the feed. The diet analyses help get at this and are another strength of this study.</p><p>Second, it would help to also briefly discuss the broader implications of these results for land use and climate change. Currently, the manuscript presents only the positive outcomes. Would changing from monocultures to co-cultures likely lead to more carbon emissions? The decomposition results suggest that this should be further investigated. Would changing from rice monocultures to co-cultures likely lead to more demand for cropland, given that soybean feed source for the aquatic animals? These implications of the results deserve a bit more attention in the Discussion section.</p><p>Title</p><p>I recommend removing 'soil nitrogen' from the title, given the non-significant results shown in Figure 1b.</p><p>Abstract</p><p>L44: here or elsewhere in the Abstract, please include a few words to let readers know that there were also feed inputs.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>L115: It would help to use a different word here, rather than 'functions' because some of the previous studies, including those in the preceding sentence, considered ecosystem functions. Also, I tend to find it more compelling when studies explain why a knowledge gap needs to be filled, rather than stating that it exists. Many things are unknown. Why should we know more about this particular knowledge gap?</p><p>L129-131: This argument seems sound if these animals do not eat the rice plants. Do these aquatic animals eat any parts of the rice plant?</p><p>Results</p><p>L147: Here and throughout, please include the numerator and denominator degrees of freedom for the F-tests.

Note that this enhanced decomposition would not only contribute to the benefit of N recycling, but would also affect the C cycle in a potentially undesirable manner.</p><p>L314-316: I am not sure that I fully understand the proposed mechanism here. Is this interpretation similar to the arguments made by McNaughton et al., (1997 Science)?

Food production needs a comprehensive overhaul in terms of sustainability, with better approaches to producing safe and healthy food, while leaving little footprint. Globally, chemical fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides are rolled back as part of our commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and the urgent need for a greener renaissance in sustainability (SDG 2, 12 and 13).</p><p>The coupling of two agricultural systems (i.e., integrated agriculture-aquaculture or integrated crop-livestock) have been proposed as one of the important ways that reduce the negative effects of food production on the environment: using lesser chemical fertilizers, no herbicide was needed for weed suppression, uneaten animal feed serving as nutrients for rice, no eutrophication, etc. While the idea of harnessing co-cultivation of plant-animal system for food production is great and beneficial to the environment, the availability of large-scale and long-term experimental data is lacking. Thus, this manuscript is an important contribution to the literature on integrated agriculture and aquaculture. The science in the manuscript is well thought out and executed and the manuscript is well written. The central research question – can yields in rice and aquatic animals be maintained in coupled rice-&quot;animal&quot; (&quot;animal&quot; refers to carps, crabs and turtles, collectively) systems, is timely.</p><p>The authors described their long-term and integrated agriculture-aquaculture experimental systems and the results of the multi-year study highlighted a 'solution' to the problem of historical environmental impacts caused by our current and common intensive food production systems (mainly monocultural).</p><p>The results suggested that the coupling of rice with aquatic animal production could achieve synergies between food production systems while reducing their associated environmental impacts per unit of production.</p><p>Going beyond the science, to help policy makers to better appreciate the co-cultivation strategy, a mention of the comparative financial returns (for the farmers) should perhaps be provided by the authors in their China-wide research? Such analyses (financial returns from selling rice in monocultures, selling rice and aquatic animals together) would strengthen the case for supporting various options: the crab-rice versus fish-rice co-cultivation systems in certain localities. Perhaps in certain situations (e.g. seasonality, lack of farm labour, brackish water issues), the other aquatic animals (prawns/amphibians/ducks) could be the preferred approach?</p><p>It is interesting to note that in China, rice yields were similar or higher using the rice-&quot;animal&quot; co-cultivation systems than under monocultures of rice. To help the readers, I would recommend that some photos for the coupled rice-&quot;animal&quot; (&quot;animal&quot; refers to carps, crabs and turtles, collectively) systems be included as a figure in this paper. The alternate is to provide some illustration to highlight the coupled rice-&quot;animal&quot; systems.</p><p>With the strong focus of this paper on N, which appeared to be an important (or dominant driver) factor, we still cannot rule out the plausible influence of animal manures releasing additional phosphorus (P) to drive rice growth. Thus, is there some baseline data about the dynamics in the soils and irrigation waters among the research sites?

In this case, not different plant species are grown together (as typically done in intercropping) but aquatic animals (carp, crabs and turtles) are cultured together with rice. Using three multi-year field experiments (one experiment for each combination between one animal species and rice plants) and three corresponding field mesocosm experiments, the authors found that generally, rice yield and apparent nitrogen-use efficiency were higher and weed infestation of the rice paddies lower in coculture with animals, compared with rice monocultures. These results are attributed to the additional feed-N unused by the animals that was shown to be taken up by plants, as well as likely feeding on insect pests and weeds by the animals and higher decomposition (also measured in the experiment) in the coculture plots. Overall, these results provide support for multispecies systems in rice production. Additionally, animal yield was measured in this study and adds to the increased economic advantage of such a system compared with rice monocultures.</p><p>This study is interesting for both, ecologists with an interest in biodiversity effects and food webs, and for agronomists aiming to increase yield while supporting agricultural diversity and limiting synthetic inputs at the same time. It is a very valuable applied study that underlines the value of diversity in agriculture. I appreciated the interesting combination of organisms across trophic levels in this culture. I also found it fascinating that this old cultural form of agriculture has a strong relevance for today's production schemes which aim for low input of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides and high organismal diversity in agricultural areas.</p><p>The experimental design of the study is clear and simple. It has relatively low power (n=6 for each treatment) but the experiments were done across several years, increasing the applicability of the results. The authors measured many relevant variables (e.g. nitrogen use efficiency) and even use C and N labelling to follow the fate of different elements in the system.</p><p>The results of the study are well supported and indicate that the coculture with animals indeed has many advantages. However, I missed a discussion of caveats and potential disadvantages of this coculture method. As far as I can see, the authors did not determine whether rice plants were destroyed or fed upon by the animals. Furthermore, coculture may pose logistical challenges such as a higher effort in management or harvest of two species that may increase costs to farmers and may make them reluctant to use this method. In addition, total nitrogen that entered the system was different between treatments (because no animal feed was used in the rice monocultures, I think), so this additional input may account for differences in yield, even if no animals are used.</p><p>I have a few major points regarding potential improvements to the analysis and presentation of the data.</p><p>Statistical analysis: I struggled to understand how the data was analysed. Was year nested within plot? Or was the experiment completely restarted every year and the data points across years can be considered independent replicates (I think they cannot, see also the temporal development in Figure 1,2)? I was also confused at times about the sample sizes behind the figures and when averages across years or replicates were used. Please be more specific here (e.g. state n in legends or on figure panels or in the text). Generally, many tests are being used where one model (testing several explanatory variables, e.g. RA/RM, time and their interaction) would likely have been the better solution.</p><p>Ethical considerations: The manuscript contains an ethics statement. However, there are few methodological details regarding the treatment of animals in the study. For example, I assume that the animals were killed in some way before drying/freezing at -20{degree sign}? How were they &quot;harvested&quot;?</p><p>Methodological details: I missed some details on the general method for non-experts of this culture technique. Most importantly: In this system, is harvest of the aquatic animals done every year? How long is the usual growing season? Do the animals grow as fast as rice? Even the turtles? Is the amount of fertilizer added in the experiment (550-750kg/ha) similar to what would normally be added to regular rice monocultures?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73869.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Statistical analysis: it seems this was done correctly, e.g using years as subplots and not as independent measurements.

The authors aimed to compare rice monocultures to co-cultures of rice and an aquatic animal (carp, crab, or turtle). The data analyses appear adequate, though I do request the degrees of freedom for F-tests to double check that the repeated measures analysis was properly implemented. The findings are of widespread importance, given that rice is one of the most widely consumed crops worldwide. Increasing the yield of rice through co-culture may reduce the demand of land for rice production, leaving more land for non-human species.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for the comments.

First, it is necessary to clarify in visible places, including the Abstract, that feed was added in co-culture. This confounds, to some extent, the extra nutrient inputs in the feed with the comparisons between monocultures and co-cultures. It might also help to include further discussion of the extent to which the increased rice yield is likely explained by each of these two things: the animals or the nutrient inputs in the feed.

In the revision, we separately discussed the effects of animals and feed input in rice-aquatic animal coculture systems.</p><p>The aquatic animals had two important roles in these cocultured paddy ecosystems. One role involved competition, i.e., aquatic animals reduced competitors (i.e., weeds) of rice plants and thereby enhanced rice yield. A second role of aquatic animals concerned N, i.e., aquatic animals increased the recycling of N in these cocultured paddy ecosystems. Detailed discussion indicate in line 266-323.</p><p>Unlike traditional rice-fish coculture systems in which no fish feed is applied, the current coculture systems, like those described in this study, often include the application of feed in order to obtain high aquatic animal yields.

Currently, the manuscript presents only the positive outcomes. Would changing from monocultures to co-cultures likely lead to more carbon emissions?

Would changing from rice monocultures to co-cultures likely lead to more demand for cropland, given that soybean feed source for the aquatic animals?

Food production needs a comprehensive overhaul in terms of sustainability, with better approaches to producing safe and healthy food, while leaving little footprint. Globally, chemical fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides are rolled back as part of our commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and the urgent need for a greener renaissance in sustainability (SDG 2, 12 and 13).</p><p>The coupling of two agricultural systems (i.e., integrated agriculture-aquaculture or integrated crop-livestock) have been proposed as one of the important ways that reduce the negative effects of food production on the environment: using lesser chemical fertilizers, no herbicide was needed for weed suppression, uneaten animal feed serving as nutrients for rice, no eutrophication, etc. While the idea of harnessing co-cultivation of plant-animal system for food production is great and beneficial to the environment, the availability of large-scale and long-term experimental data is lacking. Thus, this manuscript is an important contribution to the literature on integrated agriculture and aquaculture. The science in the manuscript is well thought out and executed and the manuscript is well written. The central research question – can yields in rice and aquatic animals be maintained in coupled rice-&quot;animal&quot; (&quot;animal&quot; refers to carps, crabs and turtles, collectively) systems, is timely.</p><p>The authors described their long-term and integrated agriculture-aquaculture experimental systems and the results of the multi-year study highlighted a 'solution' to the problem of historical environmental impacts caused by our current and common intensive food production systems (mainly monocultural).</p><p>The results suggested that the coupling of rice with aquatic animal production could achieve synergies between food production systems while reducing their associated environmental impacts per unit of production.</p><p>Going beyond the science, to help policy makers to better appreciate the co-cultivation strategy, a mention of the comparative financial returns (for the farmers) should perhaps be provided by the authors in their China-wide research? Such analyses (financial returns from selling rice in monocultures, selling rice and aquatic animals together) would strengthen the case for supporting various options: the crab-rice versus fish-rice co-cultivation systems in certain localities. Perhaps in certain situations (e.g. seasonality, lack of farm labour, brackish water issues), the other aquatic animals (prawns/amphibians/ducks) could be the preferred approach?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks, we accepted all these comments.

To help the readers, I would recommend that some photos for the coupled rice-&quot;animal&quot; (&quot;animal&quot; refers to carps, crabs and turtles, collectively) systems be included as a figure in this paper. The alternate is to provide some illustration to highlight the coupled rice-&quot;animal&quot; systems.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for these great comments. In the revision, we grouped the photos of the animals and experimental plots for the coupled rice-&quot;animal&quot; in Figure 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With the strong focus of this paper on N, which appeared to be an important (or dominant driver) factor, we still cannot rule out the plausible influence of animal manures releasing additional phosphorus (P) to drive rice growth. Thus, is there some baseline data about the dynamics in the soils and irrigation waters among the research sites? Or from past literature about P dynamics in relation to the present or absence of crabs/fishes/turtles, within a certain level of N? Current plant physiological papers, especially those involving rice growth and yield had frequently mentioned the dual roles of N and P? Some comments from the authors about P would be appropriate with reference to soil fertility and health</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for these great comments.</p><p>In the revision, the amount of N and P input <italic>via</italic> animal feed were applied in Appendix 2- table 1. Soil P before and after experiment in both RM and RA treatment were also provided in Appendix 1- figure 3. Because P is not our focus in this study, we did not present the data of P in the main text. But we had a brief discussion on the potential effects of feed- P on yield increase and soil P maintenance in RA compared to RM.

In this case, not different plant species are grown together (as typically done in intercropping) but aquatic animals (carp, crabs and turtles) are cultured together with rice. Using three multi-year field experiments (one experiment for each combination between one animal species and rice plants) and three corresponding field mesocosm experiments, the authors found that generally, rice yield and apparent nitrogen-use efficiency were higher and weed infestation of the rice paddies lower in coculture with animals, compared with rice monocultures. These results are attributed to the additional feed-N unused by the animals that was shown to be taken up by plants, as well as likely feeding on insect pests and weeds by the animals and higher decomposition (also measured in the experiment) in the coculture plots. Overall, these results provide support for multispecies systems in rice production. Additionally, animal yield was measured in this study and adds to the increased economic advantage of such a system compared with rice monocultures.</p><p>This study is interesting for both, ecologists with an interest in biodiversity effects and food webs, and for agronomists aiming to increase yield while supporting agricultural diversity and limiting synthetic inputs at the same time. It is a very valuable applied study that underlines the value of diversity in agriculture. I appreciated the interesting combination of organisms across trophic levels in this culture. I also found it fascinating that this old cultural form of agriculture has a strong relevance for today's production schemes which aim for low input of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides and high organismal diversity in agricultural areas.</p><p>The experimental design of the study is clear and simple. It has relatively low power (n=6 for each treatment) but the experiments were done across several years, increasing the applicability of the results. The authors measured many relevant variables (e.g. nitrogen use efficiency) and even use C and N labelling to follow the fate of different elements in the system.</p><p>The results of the study are well supported and indicate that the coculture with animals indeed has many advantages. However, I missed a discussion of caveats and potential disadvantages of this coculture method. As far as I can see, the authors did not determine whether rice plants were destroyed or fed upon by the animals. Furthermore, coculture may pose logistical challenges such as a higher effort in management or harvest of two species that may increase costs to farmers and may make them reluctant to use this method. In addition, total nitrogen that entered the system was different between treatments (because no animal feed was used in the rice monocultures, I think), so this additional input may account for differences in yield, even if no animals are used.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for the comments.</p><p>(1) We accepted the comments that the manuscript lacks a discussion of caveats and potential disadvantages of the coculture method. Combining with the similar comments of other reviewers we reconstructed the Discussion section, and had a discussion on possible negative effects (including eutrophication, greenhouse-gas emissions) resulting from the input of feed and the increased decomposition rate. Please see line 376-395.</p><p>2) As to the &quot;---rice plants were destroyed or fed upon by the animals&quot;, the three animals (carp, crab and turtle) do not feed on rice plants because rice seedlings have grown up (about 40 days old, 15-20 cm height) when the animals are released into paddy field. The young animals do eat the hard stems of rice plants. This information has provided in Method section. Please see line 425-461.</p><p>3) As to the fee-N input, yes, rice plants used some of fee-N in the coculture compared to rice monoculture. Thus, we have a discussion on how complementary use of feed-N between rice plants and animal can contribute N use efficiency in coculture systems. We also discuss potential effect of other nutrients (e.g. P) in the feed on rice yield and soil fertility. Please see line 324-343.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I have a few major points regarding potential improvements to the analysis and presentation of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Statistical analysis: I struggled to understand how the data was analysed. Was year nested within plot? Or was the experiment completely restarted every year and the data points across years can be considered independent replicates (I think they cannot, see also the temporal development in Figure 1,2)? I was also confused at times about the sample sizes behind the figures and when averages across years or replicates were used. Please be more specific here (e.g. state n in legends or on figure panels or in the text). Generally, many tests are being used where one model (testing several explanatory variables, e.g. RA/RM, time and their interaction) would likely have been the better solution.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for the comments.</p><p>(1) Statistical analysis: yes, the experimental year nested within plot. In our study, the same treatment (RM or RA) in each experimental plot continued across 4 years, not completely restarted every year. We thus used years as subplots and not as independent measurements in the statistical analysis.</p><p>(2) We accepted the comments that more specific explanations should be provided in legends or on figure panels or in the text. We checked all the results of the statistical analysis. The nominator and denominator degrees of freedom for F-tests or T-tests have been provided in text. The number of replicates have been provided in legends. Please see line 151-152, line 159-169, line 177-179, line 204-209, line 221-222, line 234-243, line and Figure 1-2, Figure 4-6 of legends.</p><p>(3) For the field experiment, we used a repeated measure design with four years and two culture types (RM vs RA). In our statistical analysis, we actually used repeated-measure ANOVA and focused on the effect of RM and RA, but we did not care about the effect of time or the interaction between experimental year and culture type. We thus only presented the effect of culture type in our text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ethical considerations: The manuscript contains an ethics statement. However, there are few methodological details regarding the treatment of animals in the study. For example, I assume that the animals were killed in some way before drying/freezing at -20{degree sign}? How were they &quot;harvested&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for the comments. In the revision, detail methods of the animal sampling and harvesting in the field, and methods of animal sample handling in lab were provided in. Method section and Appendix 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Methodological details: I missed some details on the general method for non-experts of this culture technique. Most importantly: In this system, is harvest of the aquatic animals done every year? How long is the usual growing season? Do the animals grow as fast as rice? Even the turtles? Is the amount of fertilizer added in the experiment (550-750kg/ha) similar to what would normally be added to regular rice monocultures?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for the comments.</p><p>(1) In our study, the aquatic animals were harvested every year. The growing season for rice-carp was from late May to early October (around 125days), for rice-crab was from middle May to middle October (around 150 days), for rice-turtle was from middle June to early November (around 140 days). In the revision, these information have provided in Method section. Please see line 425-461</p><p>(2) The coculture systems, both rice plants and aquatic animals grow as the time passed on. But growth rate of rice plants and aquatic animals was not the same. These information have provided in Method section.</p><p>3) Yes, to test the effects of animals, we designed the amount of fertilizer added in the experiment were similar to regular rice monocultures.</p></body></sub-article></article>
