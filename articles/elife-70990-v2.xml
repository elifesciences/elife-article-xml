Upon fertilization, gametes fuse and restore the diploid chromosome complement in the zygote. This sexual cycle of meiosis and fertilization was likely present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goodenough and Heitman, 2014</xref>). Studies in plants, animals, fungi, and protists have revealed intriguing diversity in the details of meiotic mechanisms.</p><p>A defining feature of meiosis is a ‘reductional’ division in which homologous chromosomes are separated, usually during the first of two nuclear divisions. A highly choreographed series of chromosome transactions precedes this division and ensures faithful homolog segregation: (1) pairing, in which chromosomes contact and recognize their homologous partners; (2) synapsis, defined as the assembly of a protein ensemble called the synaptonemal complex (SC) between homologs, which stabilizes pairing and leads to their lengthwise alignment; and (3) crossover (CO) recombination, which creates physical links between chromosomes that promote proper biorientation during anaphase I. Failure to form at least one ‘obligate’ CO between each pair of homologs typically results in missegregation and aneuploid gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zickler and Kleckner, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Although homolog pairing, synapsis, and CO recombination during meiosis are nearly ubiquitous among eukaryotes, key aspects of these chromosomal transactions show remarkable diversity across different lineages. In most model fungi, plants, and animals, synapsis is thought to be triggered by early steps in recombination. Meiotic recombination is initiated by double-strand breaks (DSBs) catalyzed by the conserved topoisomerase-like enzyme Spo11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergerat et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Keeney et al., 1997</xref>). DSBs are resected to form 3′ single-stranded DNA overhangs. Dmc1, a meiosis-specific recombinase, forms filaments along the resulting ssDNA segments and promotes interhomolog strand invasion to form joint molecules (JMs). In some organisms, Rad51 is required as a cofactor for Dmc1. A subset of these JMs is ultimately repaired through a meiosis-specific pathway that generates COs, while the rest are mostly repaired through a more ‘mitotic-like’ homologous recombination pathway to yield non-CO products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hunter, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kohl and Sekelsky, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Spo11-dependent induction of DSBs and Dmc1-dependent strand invasion are crucial for synapsis, and thus for stable homolog pairing, in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the flowering plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana,</italic> and in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bishop et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Couteau et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grelon et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pittman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rockmill et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yoshida et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, the formation of JMs is considered to be an intrinsic part of the pairing process by which chromosomes recognize their partners. In contrast, recombination-independent mechanisms of pairing and synapsis have been characterized in other prominent model systems, including the dipteran insect <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lake and Hawley, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rog and Dernburg, 2013</xref>). While crossing-over is essential for successful execution of meiosis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and in female fruit flies, homolog pairing and synapsis can be uncoupled from DSB induction and JM formation. In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> females, pairing initiates in proliferating germline cells even before they enter meiosis and is stabilized by SC formation during early prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christophorou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Christophorou et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> males lack both recombination and SCs and have apparently evolved a distinct mechanism to stabilize homolog pairing and enable reductional segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McKee et al., 2012</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, pairing and synapsis are both mediated by pairing centers (PCs), specialized sites on each chromosome bound by a family of zinc-finger proteins that interact with nuclear envelope proteins and promote large-scale chromosome movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">MacQueen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Phillips et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Phillips and Dernburg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sato et al., 2009</xref>). While interactions between chromosomes and nuclear envelope proteins play important roles in meiotic pairing and synapsis across eukaryotes, in <italic>C. elegans</italic> they have acquired a critical role in coupling homolog pairing to synapsis initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Penkner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Penkner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sato et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>To investigate how the meiotic program is modified during evolution, we have established tools to investigate meiosis in the free-living nematode <italic>Pristionchus pacificus,</italic> which has been established as a model for studies in development, evolution, and ecology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sommer, 2015</xref>). Like its distant relative <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>P. pacificus</italic> is an androdioecious species, with populations consisting of self-fertilizing hermaphrodites (XX) and a low frequency of spontaneous males (XO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sommer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sommer et al., 1996</xref>). <italic>P. pacificus</italic> also shares with <italic>C. elegans</italic> a short life cycle of 3.5 days at 20°C, produces large broods of about 200 progeny by self-fertilization, and is easily cultured in the lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hong and Sommer, 2006</xref>). Although <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>P. pacificus</italic> diverged an estimated 60–90 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Werner et al., 2018</xref>), they share the same number of chromosomes (2n = 12). Other than one major chromosomal translocation, macrosynteny is largely maintained between the two species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dieterich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rödelsperger et al., 2017</xref>) as well as other Rhabditids. Like other nematodes, <italic>P. pacificus</italic> is thought to have holocentric chromosomes, which we confirm here through cytological analysis. Recent improvements in the genome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rödelsperger et al., 2017</xref>) and advances in genome editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Namai and Sugimoto, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Witte et al., 2015</xref>) have facilitated investigation of developmental and cell biological processes at a more mechanistic level.</p><p>We became interested in exploring meiosis in <italic>P. pacificus</italic> in part because of differences in the inventory of meiotic genes predicted from its genome sequence compared to <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In particular, genome sequencing and annotation have revealed the presence of genes encoding an ortholog of Dmc1 as well as two Dmc1 cofactors, Mnd1 and Hop2, all of which are absent from the entire <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> clade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dieterich et al., 2008</xref>). Loss of Dmc1 correlates with the adaptation of recombination-independent mechanisms for pairing and synapsis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Villeneuve and Hillers, 2001</xref>). Therefore, we were keen to examine how homologous chromosomes pair and synapse in <italic>P. pacificus</italic>. In addition, genetic linkage maps have suggested that multiple COs typically occur per chromosome pair during meiosis in <italic>P. pacificus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hong and Sommer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Srinivasan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Srinivasan et al., 2002</xref>), while only a single CO per chromosome pair normally occurs during meiosis in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, suggesting potential differences in CO regulation.</p><p>Using genome editing, cytogenetic analysis, and recombination mapping, we have characterized the early events of meiotic prophase in <italic>P. pacificus</italic>. We show that homolog pairing, synapsis, and CO recombination are dependent on <italic>Ppa-spo-11</italic> and <italic>Ppa-dmc-1</italic>, while <italic>Ppa-rad-51</italic> is not essential for meiosis. We find that CO sites are designated very early during meiotic prophase, prior to completion of synapsis, and are limited to one per chromosome pair. We also present a new genetic map, which corroborates our cytological evidence that a single CO normally occurs between each pair of homologs per meiosis in both spermatocytes and oocytes. The map also provides evidence of CO suppression and segregation distortion of specific chromosomes in hybrids, indicative of reproductive barriers between strains. Our work highlights both conserved and flexible features of the meiotic program within the nematode lineage and establishes a platform for future investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>P. pacificus</italic> as a comparative model system for meiosis</title><p>The morphology and organization of the <italic>P. pacificus</italic> germline are very similar to that of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Hermaphrodites have two tubelike gonad arms in which sperm and ova are produced sequentially, while males have a single arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rudel et al., 2005</xref>). These are organized as a cylindrical monolayer of cells abutting a central core, or rachis. The distal tip is populated by proliferating germline stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B and D</xref>), as confirmed by the incorporation of microinjected fluorescently labeled nucleotides into replicating DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The injected nucleotides label nuclei at various stages of S-phase; some preferentially incorporate fluorescence into the X-chromosomes, which are silenced in the germline, as in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kelly et al., 2002</xref>). The onset of meiotic prophase is marked by an obvious change in nuclear organization in which fluorescently stained chromosomes form a conspicuous crescent-shaped mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Immediately proximal to this ‘transition zone,’ DAPI staining reveals parallel tracks, indicative of paired and synapsed homologous chromosomes at the pachytene stage. Gametogenesis switches from spermatogenesis to oogenesis during early adulthood. As oocytes approach maturation, chromosomes undergo striking decondensation between diplotene and diakinesis, a stage that has been referred to as the ‘growth zone’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rudel et al., 2005</xref>). Similar chromosome morphology is observed during a late ‘diffuse stage’ of meiotic prophase in many other eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zickler and Kleckner, 1999</xref>), but is rarely seen in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We use the term ‘diffuse stage’ for consistency with other organisms. In the most proximal region of the hermaphrodite gonad, oocytes mature and form a single row of large cells, and chromosomes condense dramatically as the nuclei grow in size. Six bivalents can be detected as compact DAPI-staining bodies in oocytes at diakinesis, the last stage of meiotic prophase preceding the first meiotic division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rudel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sommer et al., 1996</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Germline organization and meiotic nuclear morphology in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>pacificus</italic> are superficially similar to <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Projection image of the distal arm of a <italic>P. pacificus</italic> hermaphrodite gonad stained with DAPI.

The distribution of CENP-C on mitotic chromosomes in embryos and mitotic germ cells confirmed their holocentric organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Kinetochores appeared as linear structures along the full length of each chromatid on mitotic chromosomes, rather than discrete foci.

We analyzed the genome sequences of other nematodes to determine the evolutionary history of these genes within the nematode lineage.

We identified homologs of these proteins in many of the genome sequences from Clade V nematodes, but not in <italic>Pristionchus</italic>.</p><p>We tested whether homolog pairing in <italic>P. pacificus</italic> depends on DSBs or strand-exchange proteins. To generate <italic>spo-11, dmc-1,</italic> and <italic>rad-51</italic> null mutants, we first employed TALEN-mediated gene disruption, and later CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing techniques (this study; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Witte et al., 2015</xref>). Genome editing has thus far been less efficient in <italic>P. pacificus</italic> than in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and techniques such as co-CRISPR (in which another locus is simultaneously edited to an allele with an obvious visible phenotype) have not been helpful to enrich for the desired edited progeny in our hands or others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Witte et al., 2015</xref>; data not shown). Nevertheless, we were readily able to isolate mutant alleles by screening a large number of F1 progeny from injected hermaphrodites (see Materials and methods). Independent alleles isolated from either TALEN- or CRISPR-mediated genome editing resulted in identical mutant phenotypes. All data presented here were based on alleles generated by CRISPR/Cas9. Because balancer chromosomes are not currently available for <italic>P. pacificus</italic>, most mutations described here were maintained in unbalanced heterozygotes, with PCR-based genotyping performed every few generations and immediately before each experiment. Self-fertilization of heterozygotes results in broods with 25% homozygous mutant animals, which can be identified based on their small brood size and high incidence of male self-progeny. Immunostaining was also used to determine the presence or absence of the protein of interest. We also found that a freezing method developed for <italic>C. elegans</italic> that uses DMSO and trehalose as cryoprotectants (Kevin F. O’Connell, Worm Breeders’ Gazette, pers. comm.) allowed robust recovery of frozen <italic>P. pacificus</italic>, facilitating strain maintenance and archival storage.</p><p>As expected, disruption of either <italic>spo-11</italic> or <italic>dmc-1</italic> resulted in the detection of 12 DAPI-staining univalent chromosomes at diakinesis, indicative of a failure in CO recombination (Figure 5). Surprisingly, <italic>rad-51</italic> mutants were fertile and displayed only mild meiotic defects (see below). We thus validated the loss of RAD-51 function in mutant animals by generating multiple alleles, which showed indistinguishable phenotypes. We also confirmed the absence of RAD-51 protein by immunofluorescence with a polyclonal antibody raised against recombinant Ppa-RAD-51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>, see Materials and methods). Mutations in <italic>spo-11</italic> or <italic>dmc-1,</italic> but not <italic>rad-51,</italic> resulted in an obvious extension of the region of the germline displaying the crescent-shaped nuclear morphology characteristic of early meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). A similar ‘extended transition zone’ phenotype is seen in <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants that fail to synapse their chromosomes during meiosis, suggesting that <italic>spo-11</italic> and <italic>dmc-1</italic> might be required for synapsis in <italic>P. pacificus</italic>.</p><p>To visualize and quantify homolog pairing, we generated FISH probes against two short tandem repeats found on chromosomes X and IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We measured the distance between pairs of homologous FISH signals in individual nuclei for each genotype. To analyze pairing kinetics, we divided the distal gonads into five zones of equal length. In zone 1 in wild-type <italic>P. pacificus</italic> hermaphrodites, which contains mostly proliferating germ cells, pairs of FISH signals remained far apart, with an average distance of 2.4 ± 1.0 μm (SD) and 2.5 ± 0.8 μm for chromosomes X and IV, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>). In zone 2, which spans the transition zone, the average distances between homologous loci decreased significantly (1.2 ± 1.1 μm and 1.1 ± 1.1 μm for probes on chromosomes X and IV, respectively). Surprisingly, homologous FISH probes were more frequently separated in zones 4 and 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>).

To address this, we measured the distances between pairs of heterologous FISH signals in the premeiotic region (dispersed) versus the transition zone (clustered). We observed that FISH signals on different chromosomes were also significantly closer to each other in the transition zone compared to premeiotic nuclei in both wild-type and mutant animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

Notably, the region of the germline containing nuclei with fully aligned stretches of SYP-4 and HOP-1 was very short compared to <italic>C. elegans,</italic> in which SC disassembly occurs close to the bend of the gonad arm, shortly prior to diakinesis. In contrast, SC disassembly initiated much earlier in <italic>P. pacificus</italic>; the major fraction of prophase nuclei are thus in diplotene since chromosomes are only partially synapsed. Six short stretches of SYP-4 were apparent in these nuclei, which persisted over an extended region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). This asymmetrical pattern of SC disassembly is highly reminiscent of a more transient diplotene stage in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, in which the SC remains associated with one ‘arm’ of each homolog pair and subsequently contributes to the stepwise loss of cohesion during the meiotic divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Martinez-Perez et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>HOP-1 localized normally to chromosome axes in <italic>spo-11</italic> and <italic>dmc-1</italic> mutants, but extensive SC assembly failed. Instead, small, dispersed puncta of SYP-4 were observed along chromosome axes, with occasional longer tracks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The number of these tracks was variable. They did not appear to associate preferentially with specific chromosomes, and our pairing analysis indicates that they represent nonhomologous synapsis. In contrast to <italic>spo-11</italic> and <italic>dmc-1</italic> mutants, <italic>rad-51</italic> mutants displayed robust synapsis with a distribution of stages similar to that seen in wild-type hermaphrodites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

DMC-1::V5 supported normal meiosis, as evidenced by a normal brood size, high embryonic viability, and low percentage of males (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). Surprisingly, the two proteins showed distinct and nonoverlapping patterns of localization. DMC-1 localized very broadly along chromosomes in transition zone nuclei and disappeared immediately upon completion of synapsis. RAD-51 displayed a much more restricted, punctate distribution along chromosomes, which was only detected in nuclei in which DMC-1 no longer coated the chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Occasional nuclei at the border between the transition zone and pachytene region exhibited both DMC-1 and RAD-51, although DMC-1 was very faint in these nuclei and did not overlap with RAD-51 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Additionally, DMC-1 remained strongly associated with chromosomes in some late nuclei that retained clustered DAPI morphology, presumably either ‘straggler’ nuclei with delays in synapsis or CO designation, or apoptotic cells, both of which are typically observed in the germlines of wild-type <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Differences between the localization of DMC-1 and RAD-51 were further validated by inserting a V5 epitope tag at the C-terminus of RAD-51. Staining of this strain with anti-V5 recapitulated the sparse, punctate localization seen with anti-RAD-51 antibodies, demonstrating that the broader distribution of DMC-1 is not an artifact of the V5 epitope tag or antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). RAD-51::V5 also supported normal meiosis, with a normal brood size, high embryonic viability, and low frequency of male self-progeny (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).

First, the map lengths for each chromosome are close to 50 cM for both oocyte and spermatocyte meiosis, very similar to genetic map lengths in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. This indicates that a single CO usually occurs between each pair of chromosomes per meiosis, consistent with our cytological observations. Close to half of all chromatids inherited from each parent were nonrecombinant as expected if a single CO occurs between two of the four possible chromatids. We did observe a few examples of double COs in our data, but such events were rare (6/1012 chromatids), and were most prevalent on the longest chromosome (chromosome I; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Second, the distal regions (‘arms’) show higher recombination rates than the central regions of each chromosome, as in <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnes et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rockman and Kruglyak, 2009</xref>). This bias was also evident in a map constructed using RNA sequencing data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rödelsperger et al., 2017</xref>) and seems to be a widely conserved feature among Rhabditids and perhaps other nematode clades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doyle et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gonzalez de la Rosa et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Third, the male spermatocyte map showed a pronounced asymmetry for chromosomes III and IV, with COs occurring predominantly on one arm, whereas the corresponding oocyte maps show COs on both arms. Conversely, the oocyte-specific map for the X chromosome shows an absence of COs on the right arm (the single X chromosome does not undergo COs during male spermatogenesis; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). These findings suggest that COs were suppressed on one side of these chromosomes in the hybrid parents. This suppression may reflect structural rearrangements between the parental strains. Specifically, we predict that there are structural differences between the Washington and California versions of chromosomes III and IV, and between the La Réunion and California versions of the X chromosome. A lack of COs on the right arm of the X chromosome was also evident in data from RILs from a cross between the same strains from La Réunion and California (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rödelsperger et al., 2017</xref>). The CO suppression on chromosomes III and IV in WA/CA hybrid spermatocytes likely reflects intra- rather than inter-chromosomal rearrangements since the data do not show pseudolinkage of loci on these chromosomes, as would be expected if a III; IV translocation were present.</p><p>Notably, the asymmetry in CO suppression also suggests that one arm of each chromosome may contain a region that plays a dominant role in CO formation during meiosis, perhaps related to the function of PCs in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (see Discussion for more details). This was unexpected given the absence of obvious homologs of the zinc finger proteins required for PC function in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and the more ‘conventional’ dependence of pairing and synapsis on recombination that we have documented for <italic>P. pacificus</italic> (see Discussion).</p><p>Finally, we detected pronounced segregation distortion for chromosomes I and II in the oocyte map, with inheritance of the La Réunion haplotype strongly favored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In each case nonrecombinant chromosomes of the La Réunion haplotype were inherited about eightfold more frequently than the nonrecombinant California chromatids. These observations are consistent with either a bias in meiosis segregation – that is, meiotic drive – or the presence of loci on these chromosomes that cause genetic incompatibilities (i.e., inviability of some F2 progeny). Analysis of recombinant chromatids suggests that the latter scenario is more likely since a gradient in the severity of the distortion can be detected along the physical length of the chromosomes, consistent with the idea that specific loci on the affected autosomes may be toxic to hybrid progeny; it is more difficult to imagine how specific loci could lead to meiotic drive in a holocentric species.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Distinct roles for DMC-1 and RAD-51</title><p>Comparison of the activities of Rad51 and Dmc1 in vitro has revealed similar profiles: both RecA homologs bind preferentially to single-stranded DNA and can mediate strand exchange reactions. However, Dmc1 is uniquely required during meiosis. The distinct requirements for Rad51 and Dmc1 are thought to be due in part to the activity of Dmc1-specific cofactors Mnd1 and Hop2, which confer different activities, and/or a higher tolerance for mismatches by Dmc1, which may enable it to promote recombination between nonidentical homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Steinfeld et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Our analysis of RAD-51 and DMC-1 in <italic>P. pacificus</italic> reveals their distinct contributions during meiosis. The binding of these proteins to chromatin appears very different; the abundance of DMC-1 foci suggests that it binds to sites other than repair intermediates. In contrast, RAD-51 displays a more restricted punctate localization, and only after DMC-1 is largely removed from chromosomes upon completion of synapsis. Intriguingly, both DMC-1 and RAD-51 depend on SPO-11 for their association with meiotic chromosomes. We interpret these observations to indicate that DMC-1 is positively regulated by a mechanism that responds to SPO-11 activity, likely through activation of a DNA damage signaling pathway. In contrast, the association of RAD-51 with recombination intermediates may normally be inhibited until after the establishment of CO intermediates between each pair of chromosomes.</p><p>The sequential localization of DMC-1 and RAD-51 first suggested that they function independently, and this is further supported by our analysis of loss-of-function mutations. In contrast to budding yeast and <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, we have found that RAD-51 in <italic>P. pacificus</italic> is dispensable for the activity of DMC-1 in pairing, synapsis, and CO formation. Instead, RAD-51 appears to play a supporting role in DSB repair during pachytene, promoting repair of DSBs that remain after CO designation has occurred. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, which expresses only RAD-51, a similar switch between two modes of DSB repair is nevertheless observed during meiotic prophase: association of RAD-51 with repair intermediates is differentially regulated from the onset of meiosis until a mid-pachytene transition that coincides with CO designation; at this time, competence to convert DSBs to interhomolog COs is also lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hayashi et al., 2007</xref>). An analogous switch from a ‘meiotic’ repair to a ‘somatic’-like repair pathway in mid-pachytene has also been described in mouse spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Enguita-Marruedo et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, it appears that DMC-1 and RAD-51 have specialized functions in <italic>P. pacificus</italic>: formation of interhomolog CO intermediates by DMC-1 prior to completion of synapsis, followed by a more generic mode of DSB repair mediated by RAD-51. Our observations that nuclei in <italic>rad-51</italic> mutant<italic>s</italic> display cruciform bivalents and lack fragmented chromatin at diakinesis suggest that excess DSBs can be repaired through an alternate pathway that does not depend on RAD-51 activity, such as non-homologous end joining, or that DMC-1 can compensate for loss of RAD-51 but not vice versa. Future studies may reveal how the activities of RAD-51 and DMC-1 are regulated to accomplish an orderly hand-off during meiotic prophase.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Comparative analysis of meiosis reveals variations and similarities within the nematode lineage</title><p>In addition to establishing key aspects of meiosis in <italic>P. pacificus</italic>, this work also illuminates the evolutionary history of meiosis in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. A body of prior work has revealed that recombination-independent homologous synapsis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> relies on PCs, specialized chromosome regions that interact with nuclear envelope and drive chromosome movement during early prophase. Similar roles in chromosome movement and pairing during meiosis are typically mediated by telomeres, but have shifted to a unique region on each chromosome in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. PCs in <italic>C. elegans</italic> mediate synapsis-independent pairing and also act as the sites of synapsis initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">MacQueen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rog and Dernburg, 2013</xref>). In most other organisms, telomere-led chromosome movement is thought to promote homologous interactions, but stabilization of pairing and initiation of synapsis require and often occur at early recombination intermediates, which depend on Spo11 and Dmc1.</p><p>PC activity in <italic>C. elegans</italic> depends on and is largely defined by the recruitment of a family of zinc finger proteins that bind to DNA sequence motifs in these regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Phillips et al., 2009b</xref>). These proteins, known as ZIM-1, ZIM-2, ZIM-3, and HIM-8 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, act as scaffolds to recruit a cascade of kinase activities required for pairing and synapsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harper et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Labella et al., 2011</xref>). PCs have been regarded as an evolutionary alternative to ‘canonical’ Dmc1-mediated pairing mechanisms, so we found it intriguing that many of the sequenced genomes of nematodes in Clade V include homologs of the HIM-8/ZIM family as well as Dmc1, Hop2, and Mnd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The <italic>Pristionchus</italic> genus is unusual within this Clade in that it lacks apparent homologs of the PC proteins, while <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> is among the few genera that lack Dmc1/Mnd1/Hop2, although these genes were independently lost along the branch leading to <italic>Oscheius tipulae</italic>. Because these homologs are present in species that retain intact DMC-1 genes, it is unlikely that PC proteins arose as an alternative to DMC-1 function in meiosis, although in <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> they may have acquired a synapsis initiation activity that eventually allowed degeneration and loss of DMC-1. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that the ability of PCs to promote homologous synapsis in the absence of DSBs and strand invasion may be recently derived, and perhaps restricted to <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic>.</p><p>The existence of PCs in <italic>C. elegans</italic> was initially inferred because chromosome rearrangements often result in asymmetric CO suppression: regions distal to translocation breakpoints are inhibited from crossing over, while the chromosome region containing the PC undergoes elevated recombination due to a feedback mechanism that helps to ensure an ‘obligate crossover’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rose and McKIM, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). The asymmetric CO suppression we detected in our genetic map data suggests that a directional CO-promoting activity may also be located near one end of each chromosome in <italic>P. pacificus</italic>. This was unexpected given the absence of obvious homologs of the zinc finger proteins required for PC function in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and the more ‘conventional’ dependence of pairing and synapsis on recombination that we have documented for <italic>P. pacificus</italic>. Alternatively, the CO suppression we observed may result from large inversions that suppress homologous pairing or synapsis along entire arms of several chromosomes. However, such large-scale structural heterozygosity has not been detected within other nematode species and would likely result in complete reproductive isolation, so we favor the idea that local interruptions in sequence contiguity may lead to CO suppression due to a CO-promoting activity that acts directionally from one end of each chromosome. Complete genome assemblies of different <italic>P. pacificus</italic> strains will help to resolve this issue.</p><p>If PCs are indeed conserved in <italic>P. pacificus</italic>, they clearly do not mediate recombination-independent synapsis, as in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Based on our cytological observations, it is more likely that synapsis initiates at recombination intermediates in <italic>P. pacificus</italic>, although this has not yet been tested rigorously. We speculate that PCs may act as a source of a protein factor required for CO designation, and that this factor must move from the source to a recombination intermediate along the SC. For example, in mammals Cdk2 is initially found at telomeres and later at CO intermediates; perhaps it moves along the SC, thereby ensuring that only recombination intermediates linked in cis to homologous telomeres can eventually become COs. For this hypothetical movement of molecules to enable CO designation, the SC must span the distance between the ‘source’ and a recombination intermediate, but assembly of the SC could initiate at either site.</p><p>We have previously speculated that unique PC regions may have arisen in holocentric nematodes as part of a meiotic system that promotes karyotype stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">MacQueen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rog and Dernburg, 2013</xref>), an idea that seems more viable in light of our indirect evidence for their conservation in <italic>Pristionchus</italic>. The existence of such a mechanism could potentially account for the preservation of genetic linkage units known as ‘Nigon elements’ over long evolutionary periods, which has been documented through genome sequencing of diverse nematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Foster et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gonzalez de la Rosa et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tandonnet et al., 2019</xref>). When inversions arise that suppress local recombination, they can lead to intraspecies reproductive barriers such as toxin/antitoxin systems, and eventually to full speciation.</p><p><italic>P. pacificus</italic> shares many experimental advantages with <italic>C. elegans</italic> for molecular studies of meiosis. Naturally, it offers a more limited suite of experimental tools since it was more recently developed and is less widely studied. Genome engineering using CRISPR/Cas9 is less efficient than in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and has so far been refractory to large insertions, such as transgenes encoding fluorescent proteins. However, this barrier will likely be overcome, just as technical tweaks have greatly improved editing efficiency in <italic>C. elegans</italic> in less than a decade. Another obstacle has been the absence of balancer chromosomes, which are invaluable for maintaining mutations in essential genes in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Notably, our genetic map data indicating the likely presence of CO-suppressing rearrangements between divergent strains of <italic>P. pacificus</italic> suggests that it may be possible to propagate balancer chromosomes in this species, which would be welcome additions to the experimental toolbox.</p><p>Our work has now established that the recombination landscape is remarkably well conserved between <italic>P. pacificus</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic>. This was initially surprising in light of the major differences in their regulation of synapsis and recombination. Indeed, comparison of <italic>P. pacificus</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> reveals that enrichment of COs on the chromosome arms and robust chromosome-wide CO interference can be implemented through divergent meiotic programs, for example, with synapsis either dependent on or independent of CO precursors, and with CO sites designated either before or after completion of synapsis. Interestingly, other features of chromosome organization, including enrichment for novel and developmentally regulated genes on the arms, with more ancestral and broadly expressed genes concentrated in the centers, as well as chromosome-wide chromatin modification profiles, are also conserved across the Rhabditina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Werner et al., 2018</xref>). How the recombination landscape is shaped by and/or contributes to these genomic features is not well understood, but the conservation of these features over tens of millions of years of evolution suggests that they are important for genome transmission and/or function.</p><p>Nematodes are an ancient and widespread phylum in which most and perhaps all species have holocentric chromosomes. The presence of spindle-attachment sites along the length of chromosomes poses unique challenges for both mitosis and meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dernburg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Melters et al., 2012</xref>). In monocentric organisms, the centromeres and/or pericentromeric regions typically recruit factors such as Shugoshin to maintain cohesion between sister chromatids during the first, reductional meiotic division, while release of cohesion along chromosome arms allows segregation of recombinant homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Watanabe and Kitajima, 2005</xref>). Holocentric chromosomes must use alternate mechanisms to implement the stepwise loss of cohesion needed for two orderly meiotic divisions. The asymmetric SC disassembly we observe in <italic>P. pacificus</italic>, together with our evidence that the orientation of chromosomes during meiotic divisions is stochastically determined by CO position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>) likely reflects conservation of a mechanism discovered in <italic>C. elegans</italic> in which CO designation leads to asymmetric SC disassembly, retention of cohesion on one side of the CO site during the first division, and release on the other side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferrandiz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Martinez-Perez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Severson and Meyer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tzur et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, this particular solution to the problem of segregating holocentric chromosomes in meiosis appears to predate the Rhabditine radiation. This pathway relies on the formation of two bivalent ‘arms’ with reciprocal functions, which in turn depends on strict CO interference; multiple COs ‘confuse’ the system and lead to frequent missegregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hollis et al., 2020</xref>). We expect that these two features of meiosis are widely shared among and perhaps beyond Clade V nematodes. However, they may not be universal among nematodes; for example, studies in Ascarids have shown that heterochromatic regions near one end of a chromosome act as meiotic centromeres and are eliminated in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goday and Pimpinelli, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Melters et al., 2012</xref>). This mechanism may allow for more relaxed CO control and/or a different pattern of COs between homologous chromosomes.</p><p>Inexpensive genome sequencing and the adaptability of CRISPR/Cas-based genome editing has enabled rapid progress in developing new experimental models such as <italic>P. pacificus</italic> for molecular studies. Future studies in <italic>P. pacificus</italic> and other nematodes will likely expand our understanding of core mechanisms and plasticity of sexual reproduction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene(<italic>Pristionchus pacificus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> <italic>cenp-c</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> El Paco genome reference, v1, 2017/Wormbase/this paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">El Paco genome reference, v1, 2017 ID:UMMS71-6.7mRNA-1;

The wild-type strain in which most mutations were generated was a derivative of PS312 designated as ‘97.’ The Sommer lab found that this isolate was more amenable to genome editing by CRISPR-Cas9 than the parental strain. Mutant alleles were maintained in unbalanced heterozygotes. Every few generations and immediately prior to any analysis, single adult hermaphrodites were picked to new plates and allowed to lay embryos for 2 days, after which the genotype of the parent was determined by PCR genotyping.

Briefly, adult hermaphrodites were dissected on a clean coverslip in egg buffer containing 0.05% tetramisole and 0.1% Tween-20. Samples were fixed for 2 min in egg buffer containing 1% formaldehyde and then transferred to a 1.5 ml tube containing PBST. After 5 min, the buffer was replaced with ice-cold methanol and incubated at room temperature for an additional 5 min. Worms were washed twice with PBST, blocked with Roche blocking reagent, and stained with primary antibodies diluted in Roche blocking solution for 1.5–2 hr at room temperature. Samples were washed with PBST and incubated with secondary antibodies raised in donkeys and conjugated with Alexa-488, Cy3 or Cy5 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Worms were then incubated with 1 μg/ml DAPI in PBST, washed with PBST, and mounted in ProLong Gold (Invitrogen) before imaging.</p><p>For immunofluorescence in embryos, mixed-stage worms were washed off of 20 plates in distilled water, pelleted, and treated with household bleach diluted eightfold with distilled water for 5 min at room temperature. Embryos were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with PBS. To dissolve the vitelline membrane, a solution containing 2.6 ml of n-heptane, 2 ml of PBS, and 1% paraformaldehyde (final) was added to the embryo pellet for 5 min at room temperature with shaking. Treated embryos were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with 5 ml MeOH, three times with PBS, and incubated with Roche blocking reagent, primary, and secondary antibodies as described above. Embryos were mounted on agarose pads for imaging.</p><p>To label replicating DNA in proliferating germline stem cells, gonads of age-matched hermaphrodites were injected with 0.3 nM Cy3-dUTP solution.

After incubation in ice-cold methanol, worms were washed with 2× SSCT twice and incubated in 50% 2× SSCT/50% formamide solution overnight at 37°C. The next day, the worms were transferred to a small PCR tube, excess solution was removed from the sample, and 40 μl of hybridization mix containing 250 ng of each probe in hybridization buffer (3.5× SSC, 58% formamide, 12.75% dextran sulfate) was added. DNA was denatured by incubation in a thermocycler at 91°C for 2 min and incubated overnight at 37°C. Following overnight hybridization, samples were transferred to a 1.5 ml tube and washed twice with 2× SSCT. After 5 min, the solution was replaced with fresh 2× SSCT and mounted with ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Invitrogen).</p><p>Images were acquired as stacks of optical sections at 0.2 µm z-spacing using a DeltaVision Elite microscope (GE) with an Olympus 100× NA 1.4 objective.

We began with three parental lines (P0): ‘CA,’ the ‘wild type’ reference strain PS312 from California; ‘WA,’ PS1843 from Washington State; and ‘LR,’ RSB001 from La Réunion Island. These three strains have been previously used to generate genetic linkage maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rödelsperger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Srinivasan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Srinivasan et al., 2002</xref>). We crossed these P0 lines to obtain F1 hybrid CA/WA males and CA/LR hermaphrodites. These F1 hybrid types were then mated to produce the F2 generation, so that each F2 inherits a recombinant genome from both of its F1 parents.</p><p>F2 progeny were genotyped using a custom sequencing approach: juvenile (unmated) F2 hermaphrodites were placed on individual 60 mm plates and allowed to self-fertilize for 2–3 generations until their bacterial food was depleted. Worms were washed from each plates and genomic DNA was extracted using Qiagen DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit (Qiagen) and quantified by Qubit (Invitrogen). Because self- and cross-progeny can be temporally intermingled among broods of <italic>P. pacificus</italic>, we genotyped each sample using several SSLP markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dieterich et al., 2008</xref>) to confirm the presence of the PS1843 (WA) haplotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). A total of 93 validated F2 samples were used to construct genomic libraries for whole-genome sequencing using the plexWell LP384 Library Preparation Kit (seqWell), with ~5× shotgun sequence per F2 sample.</p><p>To obtain a set of reference variants for use in genotyping, we sequenced the three parental lines: CA and LR at 86× depth and WA at 61×, and mapped to the CA ‘El Paco’ reference genome using bwa-mem2 (v2.0pre2-4-gf06fc0c; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Md et al., 2019</xref>). Using freebayes (v1.3.1–17-gaa2ace8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garrison and Marth, 2012</xref>), with the <monospace>--standard_filters</monospace> option, we identified 1,395,065 polymorphic sites with that were (1) homozygous for each P0 genotype and within three standard deviations of the mean depth for all three (CA, 47–125, LR, 44–125, WA, 20–111) and (2) biallelic, with a different nucleotide in one strain relative to the other two. There were 374,862 such cross-informative sites where CA differed from both WA and LR; 490,484 where LR differed from CA and WA; and 529,719 where WA differed from CA and LR. Importantly, these sites were distributed across the genome.</p><p>We genotyped each F2 sample for these cross-informative variants in non-overlapping 100 kb blocks spanning the genome. Our crossing scheme gives rise to four possible genotypes at each position (CA/CA, CA/LR, CA/WA, and WA/LR) that can be easily differentiated based on the relative total depth f<sub>CA</sub>, f<sub>WA</sub>, and f<sub>LR</sub> at cross-informative variant sites within a block, where f<sub>CA</sub>+ f<sub>WA</sub> + <sub>fLR</sub> = 1. Specifically, we called CA/CA if f<sub>CA</sub> &gt;0.95, CA/LR if f<sub>WA</sub> &lt;0.05 and |f<sub>CA</sub>- f<sub>LR</sub>| &gt; 0.1, etc. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Genotypes not satisfying one of these inequalities were not called. Genomic blocks that contained fewer than 100 diagnostic sites or for which more than 30% of F2 individuals could not be called were not genotyped. Of the 1567 non-overlapping 100 kb blocks spanning the genome, 1398 remained after filtering for too few sites, too few individuals genotyped, and segregation distortion (p≤0.001).</p><p>By design, our cross generates sex-specific genetic maps since WA haplotypes can only be transmitted via the sperm of the CA/WA male parent and LR haplotypes can only be transmitted to ova of the CA/LR hermaphrodite parent.

have been mostly explored in model organisms. This study provides a novel view by exploring these processes in a nematode, <italic>Pristionchus pacificus</italic>, distantly related to the model nematode species <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The authors identified several differences in the control of homolog pairing between these nematodes. This work highlights the importance of exploring the evolutionary diversity of meiosis.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Analysis of meiosis in <italic>Pristionchus pacificus</italic> reveals plasticity in homolog pairing and synapsis in the nematode lineage&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Bernard de Massy as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Rillo-Bohn et al. reports the cytological and functional analysis of meiotic prophase in a nematode Pristionchus pacificus, who diverged 200-300 million years ago from <italic>C. elegans</italic> but sharing most biological properties and genomic features.</p><p>Unlike <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the <italic>P. pacificus</italic> genome contains clear orthologs of DMC-1 (and MND-1) but not pairing center proteins (ZIM/HIM), critical for meiotic chromosome pairing/synapsis in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In <italic>P. pacificus</italic>, pairing and synapsis depend on Spo-11 and Dmc-1 but not Rad-51. Dmc-1 is required for bivalent formation, not Rad-51.</p><p>Surprisingly, RAD-51 is not important for crossing over in <italic>P. pacificus</italic>. Further, the authors show that DMC-1 and RAD-51 have spatio-temporally distinct localization patterns and are not dependent on each other for localization,</p><p>Based on cytological analyses and previously published genetic maps, the authors conclude that crossovers result from both class I and II crossover pathways.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the paper is quite interesting and is adding important and novel information for understanding features of meiosis and their evolution. In general, the data needs to be described with more accuracy and conclusions presented in the text should be supported by the data with quantification (see below). Some conclusions presented in the discussions are over-interpretation of the data and should be revised.</p><p>Two conclusions presented in this paper must be clarified as they bring unexpected views about meiotic prophase:</p><p>1) Spo-11 dependent DMC-1 foci not associated to recombination intermediates.</p><p>2) Class II crossovers without chiasma (but check genetic map data, see below).</p><p>1) Whether DMC-1 foci correspond to recombination or not should be determined.</p><p>Several issues emerge from the data as it is presented : Quantify DMC-1 foci (this also applies to RAD-51). Line 292 indicates DMC-1 coats the chromosomes. This data needs to be clarified. Presence of such DMC-1 localization would be extremely puzzling and in contradiction with all current cytogical data on DMC1 localization in many species.</p><p>Either use higher resolution microscopy and/or test another tag, as the V5 tag may create artefacts, despite being functional. Localization of DMC-1 with respect to asynapsed/synapsis should be determined. Conclusions should be based on quantitative analysis not only by showing a few nuclei. As mentioned above, on Line 321, the authors conclude that DMC-1 locates broadly on chromatin rather than specifically to recombination intermediates. This statement needs to be supported by the data.</p><p>Line 298. It is concluded that DMC-1 and RAD-51 do not overlap (Figure 4C). But the legend indicates that the foci do not completely overlap. Please clarify.</p><p>Line 330. If the authors' interpretation is that these RAD-51 foci result from endogenous breaks, it should be mentioned.</p><p>Meiosis II should be analyzed in rad-51 and dmc-1 mutants? Are there broken chromatids? For instance, if there are broken chromatids in rad-51 mutants not in dmc-1, this could suggest that Rad-51 mediates the repair of DSB between sister chromatids.</p><p>2) Class II crossovers. The authors should verify information about the genetic map :</p><p>L456: Where does the information of 100-250 cM per chromosome come from? This statement does not fit the published genetic maps (Srnivasan et al., 2002, 2003) where genetic maps are between 30 and 100cM per chromosome for a total of 338cM for the 6 linkage groups (although the 2003 paper seems to indicate higher values). It does not fit either the more recent genetic map, about 310cM total (Rodelsperger et al., 2017). It seems that most chromosomes have 1 CO which would then fit the bivalent data. In addition, those maps show a strongly reduced CO rate in the center of chromosomes, potentially a similarity with <italic>C. elegans</italic> CO distribution?</p><p>If the conclusion is that there should be class II crossovers, the authors should validate this conclusion by analyzing cosa-1 and mus-81/eme-1 mutants. They should also provide data and interpretation for the presence of only one chiasma per bivalent (ie the statement about cruciform bivalent in Line 293).</p><p>Figure 1, the authors show Cy3-dUTP labeling in the <italic>P. pacificus</italic> germline. There was no mention of this experiment in the Results section. We recommend either removing it, or specifically reporting/discussing this finding. Similarly, in Materials and methods, RNAseq is included but we see no place where it is used.</p><p>Figure 1C, several points should be clarified : indicate the meiotic stages of those nuclei. Is the embryo nuclei at metaphase ? Are there chromatin bridges in the nucleus in the middle?</p><p>Figure 2, Analysis of pairing.</p><p>It is proposed that decreased distances in spo-11 and dmc-1 mutants are due to telomere clustering. One needs to know what is the frequency of clustering-like nuclei in TZ 2 to 4 (wt and mutants), and in which zones were analyzed for the heterologous controls (2E).</p><p>Figure 2D: Presumably, the horizontal bars show median and range of the middle two quartiles, but this is never defined. It is very difficult to see these bars in many of the charts, either because the bars are behind and masked by the data points or because the bars are yellow. Mean and SD should be given, either in the figure or in the text.</p><p>Figure 2E legend: Indicate that heterologous signals are between X and IV.</p><p>Figure 2 supplement 1.</p><p>Clade I is not labelled, please revise ; Clade II and IV have no ortholog for the four proteins tested ? Is this due to issues in genome assemblies ? Do they have Rad-51 orthologs ? Two columns should be added : one for Rad-51 and one for Spo-11.</p><p>Figure 3: There appears to be one to two tracks of SYP-4 in almost all of the spo-11 and dmc-1 mid-prophase nuclei, suggesting that there is some synapsis in the absence of these proteins. Could this &quot;synapsis&quot; be non-homologous? Could it be the X?</p><p>Figure 5B: the text and figure only show the mean. At a minimum, they should also include the SD.</p><p>Figure 5D: It is very difficult to understand the staining shown here. The region of the spermatheca should be indicated. The six bivalents cannot be seen nuclei with, even in WT. Symbols need to be included in the figure to highlight the important points.</p><p>Figure 5E: for % Egg viability, what was the number of eggs laid that were counted? Is this different than the value in the &quot;Eggs laid&quot; column? For &quot;% Male progeny,&quot; what was the number of adult worms counted? This also applies to Figure 3 supplement 1.</p><p>Figure 7: What are the residuals COSA-1 foci in spo-11 mutant?</p><p>Line 22: last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) is only used once, so there is no need to define an abbreviation.</p><p>Line 42: Revise citation: two papers led to the conclusion that meiotic recombination was initiated by a conserved topoisomerase-like enzyme called Spo11: Bergerat et al., 1997 and Keeney et al., 1997.</p><p>Line 113: The switch from spermatogenesis to oogenesis occurs in early adulthood in <italic>P. pacificus</italic>. This seems to be a difference with <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Please clarify.</p><p>Line 118. Please highlight the parallel DAPI tracks, they are not visible on Figure 1A.</p><p>Line 158: Clade V should be defined as the clade that includes both <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>P. pacificus</italic>.</p><p>Line 166: co-CRISPR has &quot;not been helpful for <italic>P. pristionchus</italic>.&quot; What does this mean?</p><p>Line 244, refer to Figure 3.</p><p>Line 267: The use of « pachy-diplotene » should be clarified. If the nuclei are only partially synapsed chromosomes, then these are diplotene ; alternatively it may refer to a zone where there is juxtaposition of pachytene and diplotene nuclei. But then what does early, mid and late mean is not clear.</p><p>Line 301: typo – typical.</p><p>Line 311: &quot;RAD-51 was also observed in some nuclei in dmc-1 mutants&quot; this wording suggests fewer nuclei than normal have RAD-51 foci, but the figure makes it look like most nuclei have RAD-51 foci once they escape from the extended transition zone. Please quantify.</p><p>Line 384: typo.</p><p>Lines 393-395: Provide data showing that all bivalents have a cruciform structure.</p><p>Lines 397-399: Quantification is needed to support the claim of 0 and 6 COSA-1 foci in dmc-1 and rad-51 mutants. At the very least, this needs to be given as a mean +/- SD.</p><p>In the discussion, please revise interpretations:</p><p>Lines 428-430: What is the evidence that association of RAD-51 with recombination intermediates is only permitted after DMC-1 has ensured the formation of CO intermediates? RAD-51 forms foci in dmc-1 mutants.</p><p>Lines 434-436: What is the data suggesting that RAD-51 processes &quot;excess&quot; DSBs that remain after CO designation? This would suggest that RAD-51 is not involved in processing DSBs into CO DSBs, there does not seem to be data to substantiate this claim.</p><p>Table S1: Revise Hop-1 raw, information missing.</p><p>Authors should mention that SYP-4::HA staining does not necessarily imply that the tripartite SC is formed.</p><p>Revise use of italics throughout the text : ie Line 11, 13, 87.</p><p>J4- Please define this stage for non-experts.</p><p>Define COSA-1 when first used.</p><p>Class I and Class II crossovers are first defined in the Discussion section, but they are repeatedly referred to in the introduction and results. An earlier definition seems appropriate.</p><p>For all genetic modifications (null mutations and tag insertion), indicate the protein change (truncation, deletion, position of tag…).

This has included additional experiments, most notably reexamining the genetic map, and being more precise in the description, analysis and conclusion of the experiments. One point that does not appear to be addressed (or if was, I missed it), concerns the single tracks of SYP-4 observed in the spo-11 and dmc-1 mutants (Figure 3). While the authors indicated in the response to reviewers that &quot;Based on our pairing analysis, the synapsis must be nonhomologous and does not appear to occur preferentially on the X chromosome. We have added a comment to this effect. We have seen other examples in other mutants (beyond the scope of this paper)&quot;.</p><p>I do not see any mention of this in the manuscript. Lines 288-290. It also might be worth mentioning that similar tracks have been observed in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>Typos:</p><p>Line 41-42: missing &quot;is&quot;.</p><p>Line 252: the reference is formatted funny.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Dr. Abby Dernburg and colleagues establishes the nematode <italic>Pristionchus pacificus</italic> as a model for studies of meiosis and demonstrates that unlike the more well studied nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, Pristionchus retains the meiosis-specific recombinase Dmc1 and depends on recombination intermediates for stable homolog pairing and synapsis. Thus, in this regard pairing and synapsis during Pristionchus meiosis more closely resemble that of budding yeast and mammals than that of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, which lacks Dmc1 and instead relies on pairing centers rather than recombination for pairing and synapsis.</p><p>This revised manuscript not only addresses the majority of reviewer comments, it goes for beyond the requests to reviewers, for example, adding a newly derived genetic map that clarifies the recombination landscape in Pristionchus and demonstrates cases of transmission distortion and hybrid incompatibilities. These newly added findings will be of great interest to researchers using this nematode and to evolutionary biologists. Thus, the changes in this version not only strengthen the conclusions, they enhance the overall impact of the paper.</p><p>Also of great interest are several unexpected findings that are described in the manuscript and will undoubtedly be the basis of future mechanistic studies. The broad localization of Ppa-DMC-1 on meiotic chromosomes rather than to single-stranded 3' overhangs specifically at DSB sites as expected from studies of other organisms is surprising, and may have implications for how DMC-1 mediates strand invasion. It is also curious that, although Ppa-DMC-1 and Ppa-RAD-51 both associate with meiotic chromosomes, RAD-51 does not function as an accessory protein that promotes DMC-1 filament assembly as has been described in other organisms that utilize both paralogues. Finally, given that reliance on recombination-independent mechanisms for pairing and synapsis correlates with absence of Dmc1 and its accessory factors in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and Caenorhabditis, it is very interesting that the genomes of most Clade V nematodes encode for Dmc1 orthologs and pairing center proteins, and even Pristionchus may retain some pairing center-like activities.</p><p>In summary, this paper is notable for well-conducted and described experiments that define pairing and synapsis mechanisms in Pristionchus as well as unexpected findings that do not presently lead to a mechanistic understanding but clearly whet the appetite for future studies in Pristionchus.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70990.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the paper is quite interesting and is adding important and novel information for understanding features of meiosis and their evolution. In general, the data needs to be described with more accuracy and conclusions presented in the text should be supported by the data with quantification (see below). Some conclusions presented in the discussions are over-interpretation of the data and should be revised.</p><p>Two conclusions presented in this paper must be clarified as they bring unexpected views about meiotic prophase:</p><p>1) Spo-11 dependent DMC-1 foci not associated to recombination intermediates.</p><p>2) Class II crossovers without chiasma (but check genetic map data, see below).</p><p>1) Whether DMC-1 foci correspond to recombination or not should be determined.</p><p>Several issues emerge from the data as it is presented : Quantify DMC-1 foci (this also applies to RAD-51). Line 292 indicates DMC-1 coats the chromosomes. This data needs to be clarified. Presence of such DMC-1 localization would be extremely puzzling and in contradiction with all current cytogical data on DMC1 localization in many species.</p><p>Either use higher resolution microscopy and/or test another tag, as the V5 tag may create artefacts, despite being functional. Localization of DMC-1 with respect to asynapsed/synapsis should be determined. Conclusions should be based on quantitative analysis not only by showing a few nuclei. As mentioned above, on Line 321, the authors conclude that DMC-1 locates broadly on chromatin rather than specifically to recombination intermediates. This statement needs to be supported by the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now addressed this concern by tagging RAD-51 with the same tag (V5), which resulted in sparse, punctate staining essentially identical to that seen with our polyclonal antibody raised against RAD-51. This rules out the possibility that the more diffuse staining and differential timing seen for DMC-1 was a consequence of the localization method or antibodies. We also tried to tag DMC-1, but were unsuccessful after multiple attempts, and felt that it was not worth expending further effort on this in light of our findings with RAD-51::V5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 298. It is concluded that DMC-1 and RAD-51 do not overlap (Figure 4C). But the legend indicates that the foci do not completely overlap. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the legend and text for clarity. These proteins are only occasionally detected in the same nucleus and when they are their localization does not overlap. This is consistent with our evidence from mutants that the two paralogs can function independently of each other.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 330. If the authors' interpretation is that these RAD-51 foci result from endogenous breaks, it should be mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>The RAD-51 foci in the mitotic region of the gonad likely reflect replication-associated DNA damage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Meiosis II should be analyzed in rad-51 and dmc-1 mutants? Are there broken chromatids? For instance, if there are broken chromatids in rad-51 mutants not in dmc-1, this could suggest that Rad-51 mediates the repair of DSB between sister chromatids.</p></disp-quote><p>This is not easy to do in nematodes since Meiosis II is quite transient. However the appearance of oocytes at diakinesis can reveal defects in DNA repair. For example, in <italic>C. elegans rad-51</italic> or <italic>nbs<sup>-1</sup></italic> mutants, or in <italic>mre-11</italic> separation-of function mutants, the chromosomes at diakinesis are typically fragmented and “clumpy” (likely due to NHEJ) and we do not see this in either <italic>dmc-1</italic> or <italic>rad-51</italic> mutants of <italic>P. pacificus</italic>. Thus we conclude that neither DMC-1 nor RAD-51 is essential to repair meiotic DSBs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Class II crossovers. The authors should verify information about the genetic map :</p><p>L456: Where does the information of 100-250 cM per chromosome come from? This statement does not fit the published genetic maps (Srnivasan et al., 2002, 2003) where genetic maps are between 30 and 100cM per chromosome for a total of 338cM for the 6 linkage groups (although the 2003 paper seems to indicate higher values). It does not fit either the more recent genetic map, about 310cM total (Rodelsperger et al., 2017). It seems that most chromosomes have 1 CO which would then fit the bivalent data. In addition, those maps show a strongly reduced CO rate in the center of chromosomes, potentially a similarity with <italic>C. elegans</italic> CO distribution?</p><p>If the conclusion is that there should be class II crossovers, the authors should validate this conclusion by analyzing cosa-1 and mus-81/eme-1 mutants. They should also provide data and interpretation for the presence of only one chiasma per bivalent (ie the statement about cruciform bivalent in Line 293)</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewer for pointing out the discrepancies between the earlier and more recent work from the Sommer lab, and for suggesting that this be reexamined. Although it has taken an inordinately long time (due in part to the pandemic) we have now constructed sex-specific recombination maps for <italic>P. pacificus</italic>, which have clearly shown that the early estimates of genetic distances were greatly inflated. Indeed, the map for <italic>P. pacificus</italic> is very similar to that for <italic>C. elegans</italic>, in that it shows elevated recombination on the arms (as noted by the reviewer) and a single crossover per homolog pair in most meiosis. The map also revealed evidence for crossover suppression and genetic incompatibilities between strains, both of which suggest directions for future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1, the authors show Cy3-dUTP labeling in the P. pacificus germline. There was no mention of this experiment in the Results section. We recommend either removing it, or specifically reporting/discussing this finding. Similarly, in Materials and methods, RNAseq is included but we see no place where it is used.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that these issues were called out and have now clarified both of these issues. Cy3-dUTP injection was used to pulse-label replicating chromosomes to confirm that the distal germline contains a region of proliferating germline stem cells, as in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We have removed the reference to RNA-seq, which was used here only to help verify the structure and expression of meiotic genes, and will be presented in separate work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1C, several points should be clarified : indicate the meiotic stages of those nuclei.

One needs to know what is the frequency of clustering-like nuclei in TZ 2 to 4 (wt and mutants), and in which zones were analyzed for the heterologous controls (2E).</p></disp-quote><p>The proximity between both homologous and heterologous FISH probes increases during the transient leptotene-zygotene stage, which we attribute to chromosome (not telomere) clustering. We have looked for telomere clustering using FISH and have not observed it; this makes it fairly subjective to define nuclei in which chromosomes are clustered. The absence of a discrete hallmark of clustered nuclei also makes it difficult to quantitatively correct for the differences in persistence of the clustered stage between wild-type and mutants. Despite these issues, we think that the conclusions of the pairing analysis are clear and consistent. We have revised our description of the pairing analysis to make our approach easier to understand.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2D: Presumably, the horizontal bars show median and range of the middle two quartiles, but this is never defined.

The fact that RAD51::V5 behaves as RAD51 does not allow to conclude on the potential effect of the V5 tag on DMC1. Otherwise, the authors should mention explicitly the possibility that the broad DMC1 staining observed could be a specificity of the tagged protein.</p></disp-quote><p>In light of the very obvious differences between the distribution of RAD-51::V5 and DMC-1::V5, we felt that it was clear that neither the use of the V5 tag or the antibody used to detect it could have produced the much broader distribution we observed for DMC-1::V5. Nevertheless, we have now made an additional DMC-1::3xFLAG allele. In contrast to the DMC-1::V5 allele, the 3xFLAG-tagged allele was not fully functional: homozygous animals display a loss-of-function phenotype, but heterozygotes show normal meiotic progression, and the localization of DMC1::3xFLAG in these animals is indistinguishable from what we documented for DMC-1::V5. This further indicates that the broad distribution of DMC-1 relative to RAD-51 is not a consequence of either the tag or antibody used for immunolocalization. See Figure 4—figure supplement 2 (scale bar, 30 µm):</p><p>I will note that this additional validation required several weeks to complete, including several full days of hands-on time to design and inject new repair templates, screen many progeny to find insertions, verify them by sequencing, and to characterize and image a new allele, at a cost of several thousand dollars in materials and labor, as well as time that could have been used for other experiments.

As to the differences between <italic>rad-51</italic> and wild type: we reexamined the source images that were quantified and found some genotype-independent variation in the length of the proliferative zones between wild-type and <italic>rad-51</italic> animals. These stochastic differences are often seen even between age-matched animals of the same genotype. Particularly because the region of fully paired nuclei is quite short in <italic>P. pacificus</italic>, such variation can result in minor variations in the representation of meiotic stages and thus interhomolog distances within each “zone” between datasets, but our evidence indicates that this small difference is not biologically significant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 274-287, Figure 3B: The nuclei labeled PM have puncta of SYP-4 and appear to have weak HOP-1 associated with chromosomes rather than excluded from chromosomes, which one might expect if the expression were truly nucleoplasmic. Is it possible that these nuclei are early leptotene, and that in P. pacificus adoption of the crescent shape is not concomitant with the onset of meiosis? It is curious that in the full gonad image in 3A, more distal nuclei do not appear to express SYP-4 or HOP-1, which makes me wonder if the &quot;PM&quot; nuclei are truly premeiotic or very early meiotic.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. Our pulse-labeling of replicating DNA (Figure 1B) shows incorporation in nuclei essentially up to the boundary where crescent-shaped nuclei appear, indicating that – as in <italic>C. elegans</italic> – crescent-shaped morphology occurs concomitantly with the onset of meiotic prophase. It does appear that HOP-1 and SYP-4, and likely other meiotic proteins, are expressed even prior to this stage, which is also the case in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Whether we should consider the S-phase immediately prior to meiotic prophase to be part of meiosis has not really been established even in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and is beyond the scope of this work.

How are the two arms defined?</p></disp-quote><p>They are defined cytologically. In both <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>P. pacificus</italic>, crossovers are enriched on the “arms” of each bivalent, while the central region is relatively cool for crossing-over. The coupling of SC disassembly to CO site designation leads to the formation of a “long arm,” which retains cohesion during MI, and a “short arm” which retains SC through diakinesis, but then releases cohesion during MI. It is also possible that the short arm appears shorter in part due to a greater degree of compaction than the long arm, but this has not been assessed systematically.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L484 and 585.

The absence of COs along entire chromosome arms could be the consequence of large inversions that suppress pairing/synapsis along the entire regions. However, it is also consistent with more limited structural heterozygosity together with the presence of a PC-like activity that promotes COs in a directional fashion from one side of the chromosome. We favor the latter explanation, in part because large inversions have not been detected between different strains of the same species in <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species or other nematodes. A complete genome assembly of each strain will help to resolve this issue but is beyond the scope of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L536.
