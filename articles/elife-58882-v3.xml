homogeneous spatial resolution across the field-of-view (FOV) and limited invasiveness in deep brain regions is fundamental for the progress of neuroscience, yet is a major technical challenge. We achieved this goal by correcting optical aberrations in gradient index lens-based ultrathin (≤500 µm) microendoscopes using aspheric microlenses generated through 3D-microprinting. Corrected microendoscopes had extended FOV (<italic>eFOV</italic>) with homogeneous spatial resolution for two-photon fluorescence imaging and required no modification of the optical set-up. Synthetic calcium imaging data showed that, compared to uncorrected endoscopes, <italic>eFOV</italic>-microendoscopes led to improved signal-to-noise ratio and more precise evaluation of correlated neuronal activity. We experimentally validated these predictions in awake head-fixed mice. Moreover, using <italic>eFOV-</italic>microendoscopes we demonstrated cell-specific encoding of behavioral state-dependent information in distributed functional subnetworks in a primary somatosensory thalamic nucleus. <italic>eFOV-</italic>microendoscopes are, therefore, small-cross-section ready-to-use tools for deep two-photon functional imaging with unprecedentedly high and homogeneous spatial resolution.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Aberration correction</kwd><kwd>3D microprinting</kwd><kwd>two-photon

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The amount of information carried by neural ensembles and the impact that ensemble activity has on signal propagation across the nervous system and on behavior critically depend on both the information and tuning properties of each individual neuron and on the structure of correlated activity, either at the level of correlations between each pair of neurons or at the whole network level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Salinas and Sejnowski, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr"

To study neuronal population coding, it is thus essential to be able to measure with high-precision, large signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), and without distortions the activity of individual neurons and the relationship between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aharoni et al., 2019</xref>). Two-photon imaging makes it possible to record the activity of many hundreds of individual neurons simultaneously and provides reliable measures of correlated neuronal events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kazemipour et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Villette et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Runyan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rumyantsev et al., 2020</xref>). Light scattering within the brain, however, strongly affects the propagation of excitation and emission photons, making effective imaging increasingly difficult with tissue depth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ji et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Helmchen and Denk, 2005</xref>). Various strategies have been developed to improve imaging depth in multi-photon fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kobat et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kobat et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Theer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Horton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ji et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mittmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tischbirek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birkner et al., 2017</xref>), allowing the visualization of regions 1–1.6 mm below the brain surface. However, deeper imaging requires the use of implantable microendoscopic probes or chronic windows, which allow optical investigation of neural circuits in brain regions that would otherwise remain inaccessible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jung and Schnitzer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flusberg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barretto et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Resendez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bocarsly et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A critical barrier to progress is the lack of availability of microendoscopic devices with small cross-sections that maintain cellular resolution across a large FOV, to allow high-resolution and high SNR two-photon population imaging on a large number of neurons while minimizing tissue damage. Preserving short- and long-range connectivity is fundamental to study physiological network dynamics in brain circuits. For example, severing thalamocortical fibers alters low-frequency spontaneous oscillations in the thalamocortical loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lemieux et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lemieux et al., 2015</xref>). Current microendoscopes for deep imaging are frequently based on gradient index (GRIN) rod lenses, which typically have diameter between 0.35–1.5 mm and are characterized by intrinsic optical aberrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barretto et al., 2009</xref>). These aberrations are detrimental in two-photon imaging because they decrease the spatial resolution and lower the excitation efficiency, especially in the peripheral parts of the FOV. This leads to uneven SNR and spatial resolution across the FOV and therefore restricted effective FOV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang and Ji, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ji et al., 2016</xref>). This is a serious issue when measuring correlated neuronal activity, because signals sampled at the periphery of the FOV will be more contaminated by neuropil or by activity of neighboring cells compared to signals sampled near the optical axis. Optical aberrations in GRIN microendoscopes can be corrected with adaptive optics which, however, requires significant modification of the optical path (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang and Ji, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang and Ji, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bortoletto et al., 2011</xref>) and may limit the temporal resolution of functional imaging over large FOVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang and Ji, 2013</xref>). Alternatively, the combination of GRIN lenses of specific design with plano-convex lenses within the same microendoscopic probe has been used to increase the Numerical Aperture (NA) and to correct for aberrations on the optical axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barretto et al., 2009</xref>). However, technical limitations in manufacturing high-precision free-form optics with small lateral dimensions have so far prevented improvements in the performances of GRIN microendoscopes with lateral diameter &lt;1 mm using corrective optical microelements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matz et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report the design, development, and characterization of a new approach to correct aberrations and extend the FOV in ultrathin GRIN-based endoscopes using aspheric lenses microfabricated with 3D micro-printing based on two-photon lithography (TPL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liberale et al., 2010</xref>). These new endoscopic probes are ready-to-use and they require no modification of the optical set-up.

This approach allowed us to compare results of the simulation of calcium data for both uncorrected and corrected endoscopic probes with the known ground truth of neuronal activity. Simulated neuronal activity within a volumetric distribution of cells was generated according to known anatomical and functional parameters of the imaged region (the VPM in this case) and established biophysical properties of the indicator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dana et al., 2019</xref>) (see Materials and methods). <italic>t</italic>-series were generated by sampling simulated neuronal activity across an imaging focal surface resembling the experimental data obtained using the representative case of type II GRIN lenses for both <italic>eFOV</italic>-microendoscopes and uncorrected probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,b</xref>). To scan the imaging focal surface, we used an excitation volume which resembled the aberrated and aberration-corrected PSFs experimentally measured for uncorrected and <italic>eFOV</italic>-microendoscopes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, see Materials and methods). Fluorescence traces were extracted from artificial <italic>t</italic>-series and compared between the uncorrected and corrected case. On average, a slightly larger number of ROIs could be identified in corrected probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Crucially, we observed a nonlinear interaction between the type of probe, the number of detected ROIs, and the SNR of the calcium traces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Using corrected probes did not always allow the identification of a higher number of ROIs (p=0.096, two-way ANOVA with respect to probe type). Rather, the use of corrected probes allowed to segment more ROIs with high SNR, shifting the distribution of SNR across ROIs to higher mean SNR values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, p=1E-5 for ANOVA with respect to the interaction, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). Corrected endoscopes allowed to segment a smaller number of ROIs with low SNR likely because: (i) in the segmentation method we implemented, which was based on the ground truth distribution of the neurons in the simulated sample, at least two pixels belonging to a ground truth neuron were defined as a ROI; (ii) in uncorrected microendoscopes, the axial PSF largely increased as a function of the radial distance. The enlarged axial PSF in the lateral portions of the FOV augmented the probability of sampling voxels belonging to multiple neurons located at different z positions. Once projected in the 2D plane, the contribution of multiple neurons located at different z positions increased the probability of having pixels belonging to ROIs. An increased axial PSF thus led to an increased number of detected ROIs; (iii) corrected endoscopes had smaller axial PSF compared to uncorrected ones in lateral portions of the FOV potentially leading to smaller number of detected ROIs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title><italic>eFOV</italic>-microendoscopes allow higher SNR and more accurate evaluation of pairwise correlation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of the procedure for in silico simulation of imaging data.

However, we found an artefactual increase of correlation strength with the radial distance of neuronal pairs in uncorrected endoscopes due to the cross-contamination of activity at different points generated by the larger and aberrated PSF without the corrective lens. In contrast, correlation strength remained constant in <italic>eFOV</italic>-microendoscopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f,g</xref>), suggesting that the PSF of the corrected probes was small enough across the FOV to decrease contamination of activity across neurons. This result is thus in agreement with the decreased spatial resolution observed in more distal parts of the FOV in uncorrected probes and the improved and homogeneous resolution across the FOV that is instead found in corrected microendoscopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Overall, these findings suggest that signal corresponding to individual neurons could be more accurately extracted from ROIs across the FOV in corrected microendoscopes. We quantified this in synthetic data by evaluating, for each ROI, the correlation of the extracted calcium trace with the ground truth fluorescence signal generated by the simulated neuronal activity contained in that ROI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref> left). For those ROIs whose fluorescence dynamics were determined by more than one neuron, the correlation with the second most relevant cell was also calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref> right). We found that ROIs segmented from <italic>eFOV</italic>-microendoscopes displayed larger correlation with the ground truth signal of an individual neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref> left) and lower correlation with the ground truth signal of other nearby neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref> right) compared to uncorrected probes, suggesting that aberration correction allowed to collect more precisely from single cellular emitters and with decreased cross-contamination between neurons.</p><p>We experimentally validated the results of the simulations performing functional imaging in the VPM using type II <italic>eFOV</italic>-microendoscopes before and after the removal of the corrective microlens in awake head-restrained mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i,j</xref>). The number of ROIs detected under the two conditions was not significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4k</xref>). However, we found increased average SNR of calcium signals in corrected compared to uncorrected probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4l</xref>), confirming also in experimental data (as it happens in simulations, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>) that the use of an <italic>eFOV</italic>-microendoscope shifts the distribution of SNR across ROIs toward having a higher proportion of ROIs with large SNR value. Moreover, the linear fit of pairwise correlations as a function of radial distance for uncorrected endoscopes had a significantly positive slope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4m</xref>, left panel), indicating higher pairwise correlations in lateral compared to more central portions of the FOV. For corrected endoscopes, the slope of the linear fit was not significantly different from zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4m</xref>, right panel), in agreement with the analysis of the artificial calcium <italic>t</italic>-series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). Overall, results of simulations and experiments demonstrate that correcting optical aberrations in <italic>eFOV</italic>-microendoscopes enabled higher SNR and more precise evaluation of pairwise correlations compared to uncorrected probes.</p><p>To evaluate if the segmentation method could affect these results, we compared the quality of the manual segmentation method used in previous experiments with that of a standard automated algorithm (e.g. CaImAn, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Giovannucci et al., 2019</xref>]) by computing precision, recall, and F1 score in simulated data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found that the automated method had recall values, on average across SNR values,&lt;0.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>), leading to the detection of only a minority of the total number of neurons. In contrast, the manual method tended to have higher recall across SNR threshold values. Moreover, for low SNR threshold values the automated segmentation had precision values &lt; 0.8 in both uncorrected and corrected endoscopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>), leading to identification of ROIs which did not correspond to cells in the ground truth. In contrast, the manual segmentation method tended to have larger values of precision across SNR threshold levels. Overall, F1 scores tended to be higher for the manual segmentation method compared to the automated one for both uncorrected and corrected endoscopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>). We extended the comparison between the manual and automated segmentation methods to the real data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i–m</xref>. We observed that in uncorrected endoscopes the automated method identified smaller number of ROIs compared to manual segmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d</xref>). In contrast, the number of ROIs identified with the automated approach and the manual method in <italic>t</italic>-series acquired with the corrected endoscope were not significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1e</xref>). One potential explanation of this finding is that the automated segmentation method more efficiently segments ROIs with high SNR compared to the manual one. Since aberration correction significantly increases SNR of fluorescent signals, the automated segmentation performed as the manual segmentation method in corrected endoscopes.</p><p>We evaluated the effect of aberration correction on the output of the analysis in the simulated and experimental data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> using an automated segmentation method (e.g. CaImAn).

Moreover, the slope of the linear fit of pairwise correlations as a function of radial position for uncorrected endoscopes had a significantly positive slope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2c</xref> left panel), indicating higher pairwise correlations in lateral compared to more central portions of the FOV.

VPM also receives strong cortical feedback from corticothalamic axons of deep cortical layers. Cortical inputs to VPM has been proposed to strongly modulate thalamic activity. Thus, to study VPM physiology it is fundamental to preserve corticothalamic and thalamocortical connectivity. Electrophysiological recordings showed that VPM networks are modulated by whisking and behavioral state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Urbain et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moore et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Poulet et al., 2012</xref>).

We considered neuronal activity both at the single-cell and population level. We quantified the content of mutual information about whisking state (whether or not the mouse was whisking; shortened to whisking information hereafter) based on the fluorescence signals extracted from individual neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). We found that many neurons were informative about whisking, but only a fraction were particularly informative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). Highly-informative neurons were sparse and could be surrounded by low-information-containing neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). This indicates that while informative neurons are distributed across the FOV, information is strongly localized and highly cell-specific. Whisking information in individual cells measured with the <italic>eFOV</italic>-microendoscope was constant over the radial distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>), with no significant difference in the amount of information in ROI positioned at low radial distance (Dist. low in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>) and at high radial distance (Dist. high in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). Moreover, adding neurons recorded at higher radial distances to a population decoder improved the amount of extracted whisking information compared to considering only neurons in the center of the FOV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>). This did not imply that ROIs away from the center carry higher information (information in individual neurons was independent on the cell position within the FOV, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>), but only that information of cells in lateral portions of the FOV summed to the information of more central ROIs in a way that was not purely redundant. Together, these results suggest that the corrected endoscope was effective at capturing information also at the FOV borders. Information of single cells correlated positively with the SNR of their calcium signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f</xref>), with higher amount of information carried, on average, by cells displaying higher SNR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7g</xref>).

This analysis is important because how pairwise correlations shape the redundancy and synergy of information representation is fundamental to the understanding of population codes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Runyan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rumyantsev et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Averbeck et al., 2006</xref>). We found that redundancy and synergy of pairs recorded with the <italic>eFOV</italic>-microendoscopes had, on average, more negative and more positive values in pairs with stronger correlations, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7h</xref>). Importantly, and as a consequence of the fact that <italic>eFOV</italic>-microendoscopes avoid the artificial increase of pairwise correlations close to the FOV borders, we did not observe an increase of synergy or redundancy between nearby neurons close to the FOV border (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7i</xref>). This shows that aberration correction helps avoiding the generation of artificially biased estimates of synergy and redundancy near the FOV border.</p><p>We finally turned to analyzing the properties of firing at the level of the whole population recorded in the FOV. We applied non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee and Seung, 1999</xref>) to identify subpopulations of neurons (modules, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7j</xref>) characterized by correlated activity. Detected modules were differentially activated in time and were sparsely distributed in space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7j</xref>). Moreover, we found that modules could be oppositely modulated by whisking, with the activity of some modules being enhanced and the activity of some other modules being depressed by whisking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7j</xref>). We computed the whisking modulation index (WMI, see Materials and methods for definition) and found that the large majority of modules was positively modulated by whisking (WMI &gt;0 for 89.6 ± 0.4% of total modules number, n = 24 FOVs), while the activity of a minority of modules was suppressed during whisking periods (negatively modulated, WMI &lt;0 for 10.4 ± 0.4% of total modules number, n = 24 FOVs). Sparseness of modules appeared to be negatively correlated with the WMI, suggesting that those few modules that were negatively modulated by whisking were also characterized by few, but highly-informative neurons (within the ensemble) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7k</xref>). In contrast, modules with high WMI values were less sparse, suggesting similar activity (and information) across most of the neurons belonging to these ensembles. Single modules covered distances of hundreds of μm spanning the whole <italic>eFOV</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7l</xref>). We showed that the spatial distances covered by functional modules were higher than distances obtained by chance, using a permutation test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7l</xref>). This suggests that corrected probes allow unveiling functional relationship between groups of neurons spanning the whole <italic>eFOV</italic>. Neurons could belong to different ensembles as quantified by the distribution of the values of the Jaccard index among pairs of modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7m</xref>, left). This distribution showed a peak toward the value 1 (the two modules were composed by the same ROIs). However, when ROIs belonged to more than one module they tended to have module-specific weight (i.e. different weights for different modules). In fact, the distribution of values for the cosine similarity, an index which considers the weight of ROIs within a module (see Materials and methods), was shifted toward smaller values compared to the distribution of the Jaccard index values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7m</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Improving optical performances in ultrathin (diameter ≤0.5 mm) microendoscopes with built-in optical elements is a major technical challenge. Since the insertion of the probe irreversibly damages the tissue above the target area, reducing the size of the probe and consequently its invasiveness is of utmost importance when imaging deep brain regions. In this study, we designed, developed, characterized, and successfully validated a new approach to correct aberrations in ultrathin GRIN-based endoscopes using aspheric lenses microfabricated with 3D micro-printing based on TPL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liberale et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Corrective lenses were fabricated on glass coverslips, which were aligned and assembled with the GRIN rod to form an aberration-corrected microendoscope. This optical design resulted in improved axial resolution and extended effective FOV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), in good agreement with the predictions of the optical simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The absolute values of the axial PSF computed from optical simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>) were generally smaller in the optical simulations compared to real measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). This may be due to multiple reasons. First, high-order aberrations were not included in the simulations. Second, in simulations, although the intensity of the excitation PSF was small in lateral portion of the FOV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), a Gaussian function could still well fit the dim intensity distribution and provide a clear quantification of the PSF dimension. In experimental measurements of fluorescence emitted by subresolved beads, the more degraded PSF in the lateral portions of the FOV would result in low efficacy of the excitation beam in stimulating fluorescence which would result in low SNR fluorescence signals and introduce large variability in the fit. Third, variabilities in some of the experimental parameters (e.g. the distance between the GRIN back end and the focusing objective) were not considered in the simulations.</p><p>Aberration correction in GRIN microendoscopes can be achieved using adaptive optics (AO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang and Ji, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang and Ji, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bortoletto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee and Yun, 2011</xref>). For example, using pupil-segmentation methods for AO, diffraction-limited performance across an enlarged FOV was obtained in GRIN-based endoscopes with diameter of 1.4 mm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang and Ji, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang and Ji, 2012</xref>) and, in principle, this approach could be extended to probes with smaller diameter. Nevertheless, AO through pupil segmentation requires significant modification of the optical setup and the use of an active wavefront modulation system (e.g. a liquid crystal spatial light modulator) which needs the development of <italic>ad-hoc</italic> software control. Moreover, AO through pupil segmentation may limit the temporal resolution of the system, since multiple AO corrective patterns must be applied to obtain an aberration-corrected extended FOV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang and Ji, 2013</xref>). Compared to AO approaches, the technique developed in this study does not necessitate modification of the optical path nor the development of <italic>ad-hoc</italic> computational approaches. Moreover, it is easily coupled to standard two-photon set-ups, and does not introduce limitations in the temporal resolution of the imaging system. A potential alternative to the approach described in this study would be to place a macroscopic optical element of the desired profile in a plane optically conjugated to the objective back aperture along the optical path. This solution could have the advantage of being manufactured using a more standard techniques. However, it would require significant change in the optical set-up in contrast to the built-in correction method that we describe in the present study. Moreover, this macroscopic optical element would have to be changed according to the type of microendoscope used.</p><p>Using synthetic calcium data, we demonstrated that the improved optical properties of <italic>eFOV</italic>-microendoscopes directly translate into important advantages for measuring neural population parameters in vivo. Namely, they achieve a higher SNR of calcium signals and a more precise evaluation of pairwise correlations compared to uncorrected GRIN lenses, predictions that were all confirmed experimentally in awake mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Importantly, synthetic calcium data also allowed us to evaluate the impact of correcting optical aberrations on the accuracy in extracting neuronal activity and population codes from calcium imaging data. We found larger correlation of extracted calcium traces with the known ground truth of neuronal spiking activity in <italic>eFOV</italic>-microendoscopes compared to uncorrected probes. Traces extracted from <italic>eFOV</italic>-microendoscopes were less contaminated by neighboring neurons compared to uncorrected probes, in agreement with the higher and more homogeneous spatial resolution of <italic>eFOV</italic>-microendoscopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). All these achievements were obtained without increasing the lateral size of the probe, thus minimizing tissue damage in biological applications.</p><p>Studying neuronal population codes requires the measurement of neuronal population activity with high-precision, large SNR, and without introducing artificial bias on the activity of individual neurons and the measures of relationship between them, such as pairwise correlations. In particular, pairwise correlations are thought to be fundamental for information coding, signal propagation, and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Salinas and Sejnowski, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shahidi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Panzeri et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Runyan et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that the homogeneous spatial resolution, which characterized <italic>eFOV</italic>-microendoscopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), allowed an unbiased computation of pairwise correlations, a higher correlation of extracted calcium traces with the ground truth neuronal activity, and a smaller contamination of extracted signals by neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Several studies suggested that even small biases in measuring single cell and pairwise properties, either, for example, in incorrectly measuring the average amount of correlations or the heterogeneity of single cell tuning and of correlation values, may lead to large biases in determining how these populations encode information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shamir and Sompolinsky, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Panzeri et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ecker et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>eFOV</italic>-microendoscopes allow to remove the artifacts and biases introduced by uncorrected GRIN endoscopes in measuring both individual cell information properties and correlation between each and every pair of neurons. The advantages introduced by <italic>eFOV</italic>-microendoscopes are therefore essential for unraveling the true nature of population codes in deep brain structure.</p><p>Corrected endoscopes were characterized by a curved FOV. In the case of type II corrected endoscopes, the change in the z coordinate in the focal plane was up to ~75 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This z value was smaller for all other corrected endoscope types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The observed field curvature of corrected endoscopes may impact imaging in brain regions characterized by strong axially organized anatomy (e.g. the pyramidal layer of the hippocampus), but would not significantly affect imaging in regions with homogeneous cell density within the z range described above (&lt;75 µm for type II corrected microendoscopes).</p><p>We used the unique features of the <italic>eFOV</italic>-microendoscopes to study how highly correlated activity is mapped in the VPM thalamic nucleus of awake mice with unprecedented combination of high spatial resolution across the FOV and minimal invasiveness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). The VPM is a primary somatosensory thalamic nucleus which relays sensory information to the S1bf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sherman, 2012</xref>). However, VPM also receives strong cortical innervation which deeply affects VPM activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crandall et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mease et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Temereanca and Simons, 2004</xref>). We first showed that the small cross-section of the <italic>eFOV</italic>-microendoscopes developed here preserved thalamocortical and corticothalamic connectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), a fundamental prerequisite for VPM physiology and a hardly achievable task with larger cross-section GRIN lenses or with chronic windows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7e</xref>). We then imaged GCaMP6s-expressing VPM neurons while monitoring locomotion, whisker movement, and pupil diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We found cell-specific encoding of whisking information in distributed functional VPM subnetworks. Most individual neurons encoded significant amount of whisking information generating distributed networks of informative neurons in the VPM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, the amount of encoded information was highly cell-specific, with high-information-containing neurons being sparsely distributed in space and surrounded by low-information-containing cells. Sparse distribution of information content has been similarly observed in other brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Runyan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ince et al., 2013</xref>). At the population level, we observed the presence of whisking modulated functional ensembles of neurons, which were oppositely modulated by whisking. Some ensembles displayed enhanced activity upon whisking, while some other ensembles showed suppressed activity by whisking. Interestingly, single neurons could belong to multiple functional ensembles, but their weight within one ensemble was ensemble-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Overall, the application of <italic>eFOV</italic>-microendoscopes revealed the complexity and cellular specificity of the encoding of correlated behavioral state-dependent information in a primary thalamic sensory nucleus.</p><p>One important area of future development for <italic>eFOV</italic>-microendoscopes will be to determine whether the approach we described in this study could be used to correct optical aberrations in GRIN lenses different from the ones described here (e.g. longer GRIN rods). A second area of interest will be to develop corrective lenses or compound corrective lenses for 3D imaging in larger volumes. This should be possible given that, in the present study, we designed the corrective lenses to maximize aberration correction only in the focal plane of the endoscope and in optical simulations we found that the Strehl ratio was &gt;0.8 in a 1.7–3.7 times larger volume in corrected compared to uncorrected endoscopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Finally, new fabrication materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Weber et al., 2020</xref>) may allow to develop solutions for effective chromatic aberrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>) in two-photon multi-wavelength applications.</p><p>In summary, we developed a new methodology to correct for aberrations in ultrathin microendoscopes using miniaturized aspheric lenses fabricated with 3D printing based on TPL. This method is flexible and can be applied to the GRIN rods of different diameters and lengths that are required to access the numerous deep regions of the mammalian brain. Corrected endoscopes showed improved axial resolution and up to nine folds extended effective FOV, allowing high- resolution population imaging with minimal invasiveness. Importantly, we demonstrated that <italic>eFOV</italic>-microendoscopes enable more precise extraction of population codes from two-photon imaging recordings. Although <italic>eFOV-</italic>microendoscopes have been primarily applied for functional imaging in this study, we expect that their use can be extended to other applications. For example, <italic>eFOV-</italic>microendoscopes could be combined with optical systems for two-photon holographic optogenetic manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Packer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rickgauer and Tank, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Papagiakoumou et al., 2010</xref>) and for simultaneous functional imaging and optogenetic perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Packer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rickgauer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carrillo-Reid et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Forli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marshel et al., 2019</xref>) using a diffractive optical element to provide patterned illumination of neurons but also to correct for z-defocus with an appropriate lens function. Moreover, besides its applications in the neuroscience field, <italic>eFOV</italic>-microendoscopes could be used in a large variety of optical applications requiring minimally invasive probes, ranging from cellular imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>) to tissue diagnostic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huland et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huland et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, applications of ultrathin <italic>eFOV-</italic>microendoscopes to other fields of research will be greatly facilitated by the built-in aberration correction method that we developed. This provides a unique degree of flexibility that allows using ready-to-use miniaturized endoscopic probes in a large variety of existing optical systems with no modification of the optical path.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>C57BL/6J</td><td>Charles River</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>B6;C3-Tg(Scnn1a- <break/>cre)3Aibs/J</td><td>The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:009613">IMSR_JAX:009613</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>pAAV.Syn.Flex. <break/>GCaMP6s.WPRE.SV40</td><td>Penn Vector Core</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_100845">Addgene_100845</ext-link>;

Two-photon polymerization with a custom set-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liberale et al., 2010</xref>) including a dry semi-apochromatic microscope objective (LUCPlanFLN 60x, NA 0.7, Olympus Corp., Tokyo, JP) and a near infrared pulsed laser beam (duration: 100 fs; repetition rate: 80 MHz; wavelength: 780 nm; FemtoFiber pro NIR, Toptica Photonics, Graefelfing, DE) was used for the fabrication of the corrective lenses. A drop of resin (4,4’-Bis(diethylamino)benzophenone photoinitiator mixed with a diacrylate monomer), sealed between two coverslips, was moved by a piezo-controlled stage (model P-563.3CD, PI GmbH, Karlsruhe, DE) with respect to the fixed laser beam focus, according to the 3D coordinates of the previously determined point cloud with precision of 20 nm. Output laser power was ~15 mW at the sample. Once the surface was polymerized, the lens was dipped for ~2 min in methanol followed by ~1 min immersion in isopropyl alcohol and finally exposed to UV light (λ = 365 nm; 3 Joule / cm<sup>2</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Salinas and Sejnowski, 2001</xref>]) to fully polymerize the bulk of the structure.</p><p>For fast generation of multiple lens replicas, a molding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schaap and Bellouard, 2013</xref>) technique was used. To this end, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, Sylgard 164, 10:1 A:B, Dow Corning, Auburn, MI) was casted onto the lens and hardened by heat cure in a circulating oven at 80°C for approximately 30 min. The resulting bulked structure of solid PDMS was then used as negative mold. A drop of a UV-curable optically-clear adhesive with low fluorescent emissivity (NOA63, Norland Products Inc, Cranbury, NJ) was deposited on the negative mold, pressured against a coverslip (diameter: 5 mm) of appropriate thickness (thickness: 100 or 200 µm depending on the <italic>eFOV</italic>-microendoscope type, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and hardened by UV exposure. One side of the UV-curable adhesive was in contact with the mold, the other side was instead attached to the coverslip. After UV curing, by gently pulling the glass coverslip away, the lens made of UV-curable adhesive detached easily from the PDMS mold, while remaining firmly attached to the coverslip. The coverglass with the lens attached was then glued onto a metal ring. The yield for 3D printed lenses and lens replica was ~100%.

Spatial resolution of each microendoscope was evaluated using subresolved spherical fluorescent beads (diameter: 100 nm, Polyscience, Warrington, PA), following a previous spatial calibration using a custom fluorescent ruler (Motic, Xiamen, CN). The same ruler was used to evaluate the distortion of the FOV. To visualize the curvature of the imaging field, thin (thickness: 300 nm) fluorescent slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonini et al., 2014</xref>) were used. Fluorescent samples were deposited on a microscope slide and imaged through the endoscope assembly aligned to the microscope objective, with or without the corrective microlens above the coverslip, using the coupling apparatus described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>. Imaging was performed with the distal end of the GRIN rod immersed in a droplet of water placed on the slide. We observed no appreciable damage on the lens over imaging sessions. In considering this, please note that the distance between the focal plane of the microscope objective and the endoscope assembly was ~100 µm and it was fixed for all measurements. Given the imaging field curvature of endoscopes, for both the ruler and the thin fluorescent slices (planar samples), the acquisition of z-series of images (512 pixels x 512 pixels, with 1 µm axial step) was performed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-4"><title>Viral injections and microendoscope implantation</title><p>Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) AAV1.Syn.flex.GCaMP6s.WPRE.SV40, AAV1.CAG.Flex.eGFP.WPRE.bGH, AAV1.CaMKII0.4.Cre.SV40 were purchased from the University of Pennsylvania Viral Vector Core.

Dark noise mean was best fitted by a Gaussian mixture model (component 1: proportion = 0.37; mean = 137.48; sd = 48.96; component 2: proportion = 0.63; mean = 126.83; sd = 5.02, Log-likelihoods: Normal = −3.3E5, Gamma = −3.0E5, Log-normal = −2.9E5, Gaussian mixture model = −2.6E5), while the standard deviation of the dark noise depended on the dark noise mean in a linear way (p<sub>0</sub> = −175.39, p<sub>1</sub> = 1.57).

The automated procedure that we developed for the segmentation of synthetic <italic>t</italic>-series was based on the ground truth spatial distribution of neurons in the FOV. We first associated with each imaged neuron its spatial footprint, which consists of all the pixels collecting signal from that neuron. This segmentation would be the ideal segmentation. However, for experimental data, the ground truth is not available neither to users segmenting the FOV nor to automated segmentation algorithms. For this reason, we modified the ideal segmentation to obtain a more realistic situation. We reasoned that very small ROIs are not likely to be detected and therefore we removed all the ROIs with few pixels. We tried different thresholds for the minimum number of pixels composing a ROI (n = 5,10,15 pixels). We observed that this parameter did not have an effect on the results of the comparison between corrected and uncorrected microendoscopes and therefore we set it to 5. We then reasoned that overlapping ROIs could be distinguished only if their overlap was not perfect and therefore we merged ROIs with high overlap. The overlap between two ROIs was defined as the fraction between overlapping pixels and total number of pixels of the smallest ROI. We merged ROIs with overlap larger than 70, 80% and 90%. This parameter had no effect on the results of the comparison between corrected and uncorrected microendoscopes and we set it to 80%. Ultimately, we considered that ROIs whose fluorescence signal had low SNR could not be discriminated from noise. We reasoned that a single event was sufficient to segment a ROI and we defined a peak-SNR as the ratio between the maximum peak in the fluorescence trace and the baseline noise (defined as the sd of those parts of the fluorescence trace with signal lower than the 25% of the fluorescence distribution). We considered in the final segmentation only ROIs whose signal peak-SNR was higher than a threshold of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>For the CaImAn segmentation, we tested different values of the SNR parameter (0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2), that represented a lower SNR threshold for a ROI to be kept in the final segmentation.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Statistics and analysis</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Statistics</title><p>Values are expressed as mean ±sem, unless otherwise stated; the number of samples (n) and p values are reported in the Figure legends or in the text.

This procedure was repeated n = 100 times, randomly sampling different time points and the reported information values were computed as the average information encoded across different iterations.</p><p>We sorted ROIs according to their information content and fitted the distribution of information content of individual ROIs using a double exponential function, where the information carried by the <italic>i</italic>-th ROI was given by:<disp-formula id="equ4"><mml:math id="m4"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>*</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">exp</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>*</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>*</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>*</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>We used the R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Salinas and Sejnowski, 2001</xref>) coefficient to assess the goodness of the fit. We computed the Pearson correlation coefficient to check for dependence between the information carried by individual ROIs and the ROIs radial distance (or the ROIs SNR). To test whether ROIs at different radial distances (or with different SNR) carried a different amount of information, we split the ROIs in two groups. ROIs with low radial distance (or SNR) where those ROIs whose radial distance (or SNR) was lower than the median of the radial distances (or SNR) distribution. ROIs with high radial distance (or SNR) where those ROIs whose radial distance (or SNR) was higher (or equal) than the median of the radial distances (or SNR) distribution.</p><p>To compute information carried by pairs of neurons, we considered only pairs of nearby neurons (distance between neurons &lt; 20 μm). We computed the amount of synergistic information carried by the neuronal pair as a function of the pairwise correlation between neurons and as a function of the pair’s radial distance. Data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7h</xref> were permutation subtracted. Specifically, information values were computed for n = 500 random permutations of the whisking variable label of the data, which destroyed the relationship between the whisking variable and the neuronal response. We then subtracted from the value of information obtained for real data the mean of the information obtained across permutations. We used the same permutations to compute a null distribution for synergy and redundancy values. n = 43 out of n = 61 pairs (70.4%) had significant synergy. n = 22 out of n = 31 pairs (70.1%) had significant redundancy. We fitted the synergistic information using a linear function for synergistic and redundant pairs, separately. We computed the linear fit using both all pairs (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7h</xref>) and only pairs showing significant synergy/redundancy (pairwise correlations: Synergy, slope = 0.009, permutation test p=0.2; Redundancy, slope = 0.05, permutation test p=0. Radial distance: Synergy, slope = −1E-4, permutation test p=0.002; Redundancy, slope = 7.1E-6, permutation test p=0.46). Results were not affected by this choice.</p><p>To compute information about the whisking state from a large population of neurons, we first decoded the whisking state from the single-trial population activity, and then we expressed the decoding performance as mutual information contained in the confusion matrix as in Equation (11) of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Quian Quiroga and Panzeri, 2009</xref>. We performed single-trial population decoding as follows. A Gaussian kernel SVM was trained to classify the animal state (Q or A) by observing population activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang and Lin, 2011</xref>). For each state, <italic>n<sub>T</sub></italic> time points were randomly sampled (without replacement) and split into two equal and balanced sets. One set was used as training set for the SVM, and on this data, a ten-fold cross validation was performed over a fixed grid for the SVM hyperparameters. The performance of the SVM was then tested using the test set. This procedure was repeated n = 100 times by randomly sampling different time points. The reported classification accuracy was the average information encoded across different iterations. To check whether an increase in the number of imaged ROIs led to a better classification of whisking state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>), we computed information for neuronal population of gradually increasing size. At first, we considered only the ROIs in the central portion of the FOV (distance from FOV center &lt; ¼ of FOV radius) and then the other ROIs (distance steps = ¼ of FOV radius) were incrementally added for the training and testing phase of the SVM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-9"><title>Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)</title><p>To compute NMF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), two states (Q and A) were considered. For each state, <italic>n<sub>T</sub></italic> time points were randomly sampled (without replacement) and split into two equal and balanced sets (a training set and a test set). The number of NMF modules was selected based on the ability of a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier trained on the reduced data to predict the presence or absence of whisking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Onken et al., 2016</xref>). The dimensionality of the training set and the test set were at first reduced to k, with k ranging from one to the number of ROIs of the dataset. Then, for each factorization, the LDA classifier was trained on the training set to predict the behavioral state variable, and its performance was tested on the test set. The final dimension for the NMF was selected as the number of modules at which the first elbow in the performance plot (performance increase &lt;0.4%) was found. Then, the dimensionality of the entire dataset was reduced by computing the NMF with the selected number of modules. For each module in the obtained factorization, the following quantities were computed:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Sparseness: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msqrt><mml:mrow><mml:munder><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munder><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:munder><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munder><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>w</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math></inline-formula> denotes the contribution of the j<sup>th</sup> ROI to the <italic>i</italic><sup>th</sup> module.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Andrew King as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Darcy S Peterka (Reviewer #2); Kaspar Podgorski (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Your manuscript describes the development and use of microfabricated corrector lenses for improving GRIN lens imaging. These correction lenses increase the usable field-of-view (FOV) of a given GRIN lens, and improves the resolution. The approach was validated in a variety of samples.

Performance of the microlens corrected eFOV endoscopes was demonstrated with simulations on synthetic calcium data and in vivo activity imaging. In addition, the eFOV microendoscopes were used to investigate VPM activity correlated with locomotion, whisker movement, and pupil diameter. Cell-specific encoding in VPM during these behaviors are further scrutinized with statistical and machine learning methods. The presentation of the methods and the results are clear. The methods are useful and reasonably practical for increasing the FOV of ultrathin microendoscopes, which is a major limitation for small GRIN lenses. Overall, I recommend publication of the paper in <italic>eLife</italic>. Listed below are a number of concerns that we hope the authors can address in their revision to further improve the manuscript.</p><p>1) For the design and fabrication of the eFOV-microendoscope:</p><p>a) The authors presented four types of GRIN lenses (Type I-IV). Four different models of the GRIN lens are shown in subsection “Corrective lens manufacturing and microendoscope assembly”. It will probably help if the authors can explicitly indicate the Types with the model number.</p><p>b) It is claimed that the experimental result is similar to ray-trace simulation as shown in Figure 2. However, there is no comparison to support the claim. The high-order coefficient in the gradient profile in GRIN lens is usually not included in the optical model used for ray-trace. High-order aberration will thus not be reflected in the simulation. It would be important to know the difference between the simulation result and the experimental result. For example, the authors can add experimental data in Figure 2 or add simulation data in Figure 3.</p><p>c) For all the experiments, is it performed with the 2-photon polymerized lens with resin or with lens replica using a molded UV-curable adhesive? Is the aberration correction performance different from these two fabrication methods? Which material is the ray-tracing simulation based on?</p><p>d) What is the yield of the lens fabricated? How is the cured UV-curable adhesive detached from the PDMS mold? During imaging sessions, was there any damage on the lens?</p><p>e) How does the correction microlens affect the focal length of the GRIN lens. In other words, what is the allowable change in working distance before and after the correction?</p><p>f) There appears to be a much larger field curvature with the corrected GRIN lens. It would be helpful to discuss the impact of this on functional imaging.</p><p>g) Instead of AO with an active element (e.g., SLM), one could also put a fixed lens with the desired curvature in the place of the SLM. Compared to the microlens approach, one needs to modify the excitation path somewhat, but the lens can be fabricated using standard techniques and may be more accessible to most research labs. It might be informative to the readers to comment on this alternative approach.</p><p>2) For the data taken with the eFOV-microendoscope, there is ~2x improvement in FOV for type III lens (Figure 3G). However, in Figure 3—figure supplement 5C, the images before and after correction for type III lens is almost the same.</p><p>3) For the data simulation and analysis:</p><p>a) Analysis was shown to correlate whisking, locomotion and cell-specific encoding. Figure 6C and 6D show that locomotion is usually correlated with a higher ΔF/F. Could this be a result of the motion artifact during locomotion from the head-constraint mouse?</p><p>b) To simulate synthetic calcium data, different models (Gaussian Mixture, lognormal, etc.) are used to obtain the pixel intensity value as described in subsection “Generation of fluorescence time series”. It is mentioned that the model is obtained by fitting the experimental data. What criteria (e.g. comparing likelihood) is used to choose those specific models? What other distribution is tested to choose the best-fit model?</p><p>c) As mentioned in subsection “Analysis of field distortion and calibration of the pixel size”, the author used a gaussian profile to define axial resolution. It is probably better to fit with a Lorentzian function I(z)=〖(1/(1+〖(z/zR)〗^2 ))〗^2 for 2-photon excitation, where zR is the Rayleigh range of the gaussian focus. Not sure how large the difference will be between these two fits.</p><p>d) Figure 4D. It is not clear to me why the ROI number is smaller for the corrected lens than the uncorrected when the peak SNR value is small (e.g., less than 10). Can the authors add some explanations?</p><p>e) The authors claim that &quot;pairwise correlation increased as a function of the radial distance of the pair in uncorrected probes compared to corrected ones.&quot; Figure 4M does not seem to show noticeable increase as a function of the radial distance for the uncorrected lens (left panel). Rather, it seems to show a noticeable decrease as a function of the radial distance for the corrected lens (right panel). Therefore, the statement does not seem to be supported by Figure 4M. This is confusing, and some explanation is needed.</p><p>4) There is a typo in the first sentence of subsection “Fabrication of eFOV-microendoscopes”. I believe it is (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C) instead of (Figure 1C).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this paper, the authors describe the creation and use of microfabricated corrector lenses for improving GRIN lens imaging. GRIN lenses are one of a few technologies (and the only one that is &quot;mature&quot;) that allow for high resolution optical imaging in brains at depths beyond ~1.5 mm. These correction lenses a) increase the usable field-of-view (FOV) of a given GRIN lens, and b) improve the fidelity of signals extracted from regions-of-interest (ROIs), by decreasing the point spread function (PSF) volume. Both are important for high fidelity recording of neuronal populations. The paper is well written, and I find their demonstrations compelling. I think the work is of broad interest, and suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, after addressing a few concerns and questions.</p><p>My comments below are mainly critical, but I note that I think the paper overall is very good, and thorough, and I have high enthusiasm.</p><p>Given that the surface profiles begin their optimization from an analytical expression, It would be nice if the authors could comment on the likely maximal possible correction possible – that is on a GRIN lens with a GRIN relay of significant pitch, do they think microlenses would be similarly manufacturable or effective?</p><p>In the simulated imaging data, especially the figure, and SNR conclusions drawn from that, I think it is important to more clearly identify the results as &quot;simulations&quot;. The authors do label and describe the data as such, however, because of the look of the figure, and in the Discussion, it is very easy to misinterpret as measured experimental data, rather than an in silico sim – perhaps panel shading on a-h would help?</p><p>Regarding the simulations, it was not clear what the &quot;imaging&quot; rate was set to be. I am curious why processes where not included in the in silico simulation. I would expect the corrected FOVs to have even better performance than uncorrected, if processes were included, and it would have been nice to explore. Further, I am not quite sure why the authors did not use a standard method to extract the putative ROIs, and compare that with their ground truth – it seems they considered the flaws of standard practice, and biased their sampling of ROIs directly – but I would think using a standard pipeline instead would have been more informative.</p><p>Along with this, in the real experiments, different methods were used to pick the ROIs – I am wondering if the authors could comment on the rational for the choices? I say this also, because while one would prefer to record more faithful signals directly, it isn't clear to me that some of the additional &quot;mixing&quot; that would occur between the ROIs would not be removed through source factorization.</p><p>The slow imaging rate also leads to higher correlations. Did the authors also collect signals at high frame rates? The basic optical properties would not change at higher rates, but 2-3 Hz is far from typical functional imaging rates. The gains in SNR may be more material at these higher frame rates too. Was it simply a microscope limitation that prohibited faster imaging?</p><p>For Figure 7, It is not clear to me why there should be a bias toward information away from the center assuming (semi) random placement of the GRIN- do the authors think that this is real, or simply a measurement artifact – the center of the FOV is nominally furthest from completely healthy tissue, so the slightly lower information reflects network damage? That would also affect the magnitude (but likely not the fundamental interpretation) of the spatial distribution of cells in the modules.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this paper, the authors describe a novel approach for improving two-photon imaging through thin GRIN-lens endoscopes by using a nanofabricated corrective lens. They validate the approach with in vitro measurements and simulations, and apply the technique to imaging a variety of samples, most notably somatosensory thalamus in awake, behaving mice.</p><p>The technique seems easy to apply and could advance the state of the art in several labs. Although I haven't done such experiments myself, I know from other groups that experiments are often sorely limited by their field of view. This paper presents an exciting solution to this problem.</p><p>I am enthusiastic about the work, but point out the following issues:</p><p>1) With uncorrected GRIN endoscopes, 3D imaging is possible. Do the corrective lenses affect the axial range that can be scanned this way, and if they do, how does this impact the total of neurons that can be recorded with a corrected vs uncorrected endoscope? Zemax simulations would be sufficient to address this.</p><p>2) I think the paper could do a better job of motivating the need for thinner endoscopes, particularly in the Introduction. Figure 5 leaves me wondering whether connections would really be disrupted by a larger endoscope. Figure 3—figure supplement 7 makes it clear that larger endoscopes and cannulae require removing a lot of structures, but the paper leaves it to the reader to imagine the consequences. Have there been published accounts of failure rates for different endoscope sizes? Perhaps your own experiences, or studies of e.g. amygdala or hypothalamus?</p><p>3) The methods used to segment/analyze calcium imaging data (subsection “Segmentation of simulated time series”) come off as somewhat straw-man. There are a variety of activity-based tools that can separate mixed signals from overlapping cells (PCA/ICA, NMF, CNMF, etc.), and these have been popular for (1P) endoscopic imaging. I wonder if such methods narrow the gap between uncorrected and corrected SNRs and correlations. The statements at the end of paragraph five of the Discussion seem a bit strong if this possibility has not been explored.</p><p>4) How chromatic are these corrections? The authors propose simultaneous functional imaging and optogenetic perturbations with these corrective lenses, but this would require the correction be useful across a large wavelength range (perhaps ~900nm and ~1040nm), which needs more evidence. Chromatic issues can easily affect 2P imaging even over the bandwidth of a femtosecond laser.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58882.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors demonstrated an extended field-of-view (eFOV), thin (&lt;500μm) microendoscopes by adding aberration correcting microlenses fabricated bt TPL.

For example, the authors can add experimental data in Figure 2 or add simulation data in Figure 3.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s comment, we ran simulations (now shown in new Figure 2—figure supplements 1-2) to quantify the excitation PSF for the four types of endoscopes and to compare these simulation results with the experimental findings displayed in Figure 3. Similarly to what observed in real experiments, in optical simulations we found that the axial dimension of the PSF in lateral portions of the FOV remained smaller and more similar to the axial dimension of the PSF in the center of the FOV in corrected compared to uncorrected endoscopes. Thus, these new optical simulations predicted enlarged FOV in corrected microendoscopes, a result that we experimentally validated (Figure 3). We edited the text in paragraph two of the Results and figures (new Figure 2—figure supplements 1-2) to include these new findings.</p><p>It must be noted that the absolute values of the axial PSF were generally smaller in the optical simulations compared to real measurements. This may be due to multiple reasons. First, as suggested by the reviewer, high-order aberrations were not included in the simulations. Second, in simulations, although the intensity of the excitation PSF was small in lateral portion of the FOV (Figure 2), a Gaussian function could still reliably fit the dim intensity distribution and provide a clear quantification of the PSF dimension. In experimental measurements of fluorescence emitted by subresolved beads, the more degraded PSF in the lateral portions of the FOV would result in low efficacy of the excitation beam in stimulating fluorescence, which would result in low SNR fluorescence signals. This would introduce large variability in the fit. Third, small variability in some of the experimental parameters (e.g., the distance between the GRIN back end and the focusing objective) were not reflected in the simulations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) For all the experiments, is it performed with the 2-photon polymerized lens with resin or with lens replica using a molded UV-curable adhesive?

Ray-trace simulation were performed considering the material used in lens replica (i.e., NOA63).

During imaging sessions, was there any damage on the lens?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments and we inserted the requested information in the text. Specifically:</p><p>“The yield for 3D printed lenses and lens replica was ~ 100 %.”</p><p>During molding, one drop of UV-curable adhesive was first put on a coverslip, which was then pressed against the mold. One side of the UV-curable adhesive was in contact with the mold, the other side was instead attached to the coverslip. After UV curing, by gently pulling the glass coverslip away the lens made of UV curable adhesive detached easily from the PDMS mold, while remaining firmly attached to the coverslip. This is now more clearly described in subsection “Corrective lens manufacturing and microendoscope assembly”.</p><p>We observed no appreciable damage on the lens over imaging sessions (now reported in subsection “Optical characterization of eFOV-microendoscopes”). In considering this, please note that laser beam is not directly focused on the polymer lens, but rather about 100 µm above it (Figure 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) How does the correction microlens affect the focal length of the GRIN lens. In other words, what is the allowable change in working distance before and after the correction?</p></disp-quote><p>The simulated focal length in the absence and presence of the corrective microlens for the four different types of endoscopes is now reported in a novel table (new Supplementary file 1-table 2). The difference in focal length between uncorrected and corrected endoscopes is in the range 2-23 µm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f) There appears to be a much larger field curvature with the corrected GRIN lens. It would be helpful to discuss the impact of this on functional imaging.</p></disp-quote><p>A short paragraph describing the impact of the larger field curvature of corrected endoscopes on functional imaging has been added in the Discussion. It reads: “Corrected endoscopes are characterized by a curved FOV. In the case of type II corrected endoscopes, the change in the z coordinate in the focal plane can be up to 75 µm (Figure 3). This z value is smaller for all other corrected endoscope types (Figure 3). The observed field curvature of corrected endoscopes may impact imaging in brain regions characterized by strong axially organized anatomy (e.g., the pyramidal layer of the hippocampus), but would not significantly affect imaging in regions with homogeneous cell density within the z range described above (&lt; 75 µm for type II corrected microendoscopes).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>g) Instead of AO with an active element (e.g., SLM), one could also put a fixed lens with the desired curvature in the place of the SLM. Compared to the microlens approach, one needs to modify the excitation path somewhat, but the lens can be fabricated using standard techniques and may be more accessible to most research labs. It might be informative to the readers to comment on this alternative approach.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s comment, we modified the text to discuss this possibility. The new text reads: “A potential alternative to the approach describe in this study would be to place a macroscopic optical element of the desired profile in a plane optically conjugated to the objective back aperture along the optical path. This solution could have the advantage of being manufactured using more standard techniques. However, it would require significant change in the optical set-up, in contrast to the built-in correction method that we describe in the present study. Moreover, this macroscopic optical element would have to be changed according to the type of microendoscope used”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) For the data taken with the eFOV-microendoscope, there is ~2x improvement in FOV for type III lens (Figure 3g). However, in Figure 3—figure supplement 5C, the images before and after correction for type III lens is almost the same.</p></disp-quote><p>We substituted the images in Figure 3—figure supplement 5C with new ones that are more representative of the results shown in Figure 3G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) For the data simulation and analysis:</p><p>a) Analysis was shown to correlate whisking, locomotion and cell-specific encoding. Figure 6C and 6D show that locomotion is usually correlated with a higher ΔF/F. Could this be a result of the motion artifact during locomotion from the head-constraint mouse?</p></disp-quote><p>We think it is unlikely that the observed increase in ΔF/F is due to motion artifacts during locomotion because: <italic>i)</italic> we implemented a motion correction procedure in our data analysis; <italic>ii)</italic> the effect of potential motion artefacts on ΔF/F values would likely be that of increasing dispersion rather than biasing the mean towards higher values, as observed in Figure 6F. This is because a change in focus or a x,y translation due to a motion artefact would likely have similar probability of increasing or decreasing ΔF/F values.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) To simulate synthetic calcium data, different models (Gaussian Mixture, lognormal, etc.) are used to obtain the pixel intensity value as described in subsection “Generation of fluorescence time series”.

It is not clear to me why the ROI number is smaller for the corrected lens than the uncorrected when the peak SNR value is small (e.g., less than 10). Can the authors add some explanations?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. The smaller number of ROIs when the SNR is low in corrected endoscopes is due to:</p><p>1) In the segmentation method we implemented, which is based on the ground truth distribution of the neurons in the simulated sample, at least two pixels belonging to a ground truth neuron are defined as a ROI.</p><p>2) In uncorrected endoscopes, the axial PSF largely increases as a function of the radial distance. The enlarged axial PSF in the lateral portions of the FOV augments the probability of sampling voxels belonging to multiple neurons located at different z positions. Once projected in the 2D plane, the contribution of multiple neurons located at different z positions increases the probability of having pixels belonging to ROIs. An increased axial PSF thus leads to an increased number of detected ROIs.</p><p>3) Corrected endoscopes have smaller axial PSF compared to uncorrected ones and thus smaller number of detected ROIs.</p><p>We added a short text to better explain this result in subsection “Higher SNR and more precise evaluation of pairwise correlation in eFOV-microendoscopes”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) The authors claim that &quot;pairwise correlation increased as a function of the radial distance of the pair in uncorrected probes compared to corrected ones.&quot; Figure 4M does not seem to show noticeable increase as a function of the radial distance for the uncorrected lens (left panel). Rather, it seems to show a noticeable decrease as a function of the radial distance for the corrected lens (right panel). Therefore, the statement does not seem to be supported by Figure 4M. This is confusing, and some explanation is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point and we apologize with them if the indicated sentence was imprecise and generated confusion. What we meant was that the linear fit of pairwise correlations as a function of radial position for uncorrected endoscopes had a significantly positive slope (Figure 4M, left panel, slope = 0.0002, permutation test p = 0.006), indicating higher pairwise correlations in lateral compared to more central portions of the FOV. For corrected endoscopes, the slope of the linear fit was not significantly different from zero (Figure 4M, right panel, slope = -0.0005, permutation test p = 0.05 for dataset 1; slope = -0.0007, permutation test p = 0.05 for dataset 2). We modified the text to correct the previous imprecision and clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There is a typo in the first sentence of subsection “Fabrication of eFOV-microendoscopes”. I believe it is (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C) instead of (Figure 1C).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for spotting this error. It has been fixed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this paper, the authors describe the creation and use of microfabricated corrector lenses for improving GRIN lens imaging. GRIN lenses are one of a few technologies (and the only one that is &quot;mature&quot;) that allow for high resolution optical imaging in brains at depths beyond ~1.5 mm. These correction lenses a) increase the usable field-of-view (FOV) of a given GRIN lens, and b) improve the fidelity of signals extracted from regions-of-interest (ROIs), by decreasing the point spread function (PSF) volume. Both are important for high fidelity recording of neuronal populations. The paper is well written, and I find their demonstrations compelling. I think the work is of broad interest, and suitable for publication in eLife, after addressing a few concerns and questions.</p><p>My comments below are mainly critical, but I note that I think the paper overall is very good, and thorough, and I have high enthusiasm.</p><p>Given that the surface profiles begin their optimization from an analytical expression, It would be nice if the authors could comment on the likely maximal possible correction possible – that is on a GRIN lens with a GRIN relay of significant pitch, do they think microlenses would be similarly manufacturable or effective?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this interesting question. It is expected that optical aberrations of GRIN-rod lenses become more pronounced as the GRIN-rod length increases. This raises the possibility that the needed correcting lens profile could significantly differ from our current initial guess (the Schmidt corrector plate profile). To properly answer the reviewer’s question, there are thus a number of issues that need to be evaluated altogether, namely: a) up to what length of the GRIN-rod, for a given NA, the Schmidt corrector plate profile is an effective starting guess for the lens optimization process; b) once such an optimized correcting profile is found, to what extent the introduced correction is able to increase the effective FOV; c) how accurately the complex correcting lens profile could be reproduced by 3D micro-printing. Because our present approach satisfactory works for the GRIN-rod lengths considered in our study (1.1 mm – 4.07 mm), and because of the amount of work needed to address the manifold and interrelated aspects of the asked question, we deemed it to be the subject of a whole new study. As consequence, we currently cannot provide a final answer to this question, but we aim at addressing the matter in the continuation of our work. Please note that in the paper we do not make any claim that the method is applicable to GRIN lenses of any length, and we made sure in revision that this limitation in scope is acknowledged.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the simulated imaging data, especially the figure, and SNR conclusions drawn from that, I think it is important to more clearly identify the results as &quot;simulations&quot;. The authors do label and describe the data as such, however, because of the look of the figure, and in the Discussion, it is very easy to misinterpret as measured experimental data, rather than an in silico sim – perhaps panel shading on a-h would help?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion. We followed the indication of the reviewer and modified Figure 4 to make clear, using boxes, which data come from simulations and which from real experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the simulations, it was not clear what the &quot;imaging&quot; rate was set to be.</p></disp-quote><p>In the simulations the “imaging” rate was set to 5 Hz. This is indicated in subsection “Generation of fluorescence time series”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I am curious why processes where not included in the in silico simulation. I would expect the corrected FOVs to have even better performance than uncorrected, if processes were included, and it would have been nice to explore.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not address the impact of including processes in the simulations, because the axial PSF of the GRIN microendoscopes was in the range 8-10 µm and the labeling that we achieved in our preparation was rather dense. Under these experimental conditions, resolving individual neuronal processes was complicated and we limited our goal to image fluorescent signals from neuronal cell bodies. We agree with the reviewer this is an interesting point, which can be addressed in future investigations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, I am not quite sure why the authors did not use a standard method to extract the putative ROIs, and compare that with their ground truth – it seems they considered the flaws of standard practice, and biased their sampling of ROIs directly – but I would think using a standard pipeline instead would have been more informative.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s comment, we first compared the quality of the manual segmentation described in this study with that of a standard automated algorithm (e.g., CaImAn, (Giovannucci et al., 2019) by computing precision, recall, and F1 score in simulated data (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1). We found that the automated method was characterized by recall values which were, on average across SNR values, &lt; 0.4 (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1A), leading to the detection of only a minority of the total number of neurons. In contrast, the manual method led to higher recall across SNR threshold values. Notably, both manual and automated methods yielded larger recall in corrected endoscopes compared to uncorrected ones. Moreover, for low SNR threshold values the automated segmentation had precision values &lt; 0.8 in both uncorrected and corrected endoscopes (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1B), leading to identification of ROIs which did not correspond to cells in the ground truth. In contrast, the manual segmentation method had much larger values of precision across SNR threshold levels. Overall, F1 scores were higher for the manual segmentation method compared to the automated one for both uncorrected and corrected endoscopes (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1C). Because of these results showing better performance of the manual segmentations in simulated data (an observation now included in the revised manuscript), we took the decision to present in the main figures of the paper results based on manual segmentation.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we extended the comparison between the manual and automated segmentation methods to real data. We observed that in uncorrected endoscopes CaImAn identified smaller number of ROIs compared to manual segmentation (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1D). In contrast, the number of ROIs identified with CaImAn and the manual method in t-series acquired with the corrected endoscope were not significantly different (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1E). One potential explanation of this finding is that the automated segmentation method more efficiently segments ROIs with high SNR compared to the manual one. Since aberration correction significantly increases SNR of fluorescent signals, the automated segmentation performed as the manual segmentation method in corrected endoscopes.</p><p>Overall, we believe that, in the context of our study, the use of the manual segmentation method rather than an automated segmentation algorithm is still preferable, because it allowed a more precise evaluation of ROIs in simulated data and fairer comparison of corrected and uncorrected endoscopes in real data. Most importantly, improvements introduced by corrected endoscopes could be observed with both the manual and the automated segmentation methods (see response to the next point). We believe that the comparisons suggested by reviewer are of interest and we feel that the new results in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 improve our manuscript. We are grateful to the reviewer for this suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Along with this, in the real experiments, different methods were used to pick the ROIs – I am wondering if the authors could comment on the rational for the choices? I say this also, because while one would prefer to record more faithful signals directly, it isn't clear to me that some of the additional &quot;mixing&quot; that would occur between the ROIs would not be removed through source factorization.</p></disp-quote><p>In all experiments presented in the main paper, we used our customized manual pipeline for the analysis of fluorescence t-series. In Figure 3—figure supplement 6 we used a different method, the PCA/ICA algorithm described in Mukamel et al., Neuron 2009, to segment neurons and extract calcium signals. This was originally done to show that data recorded with corrected endoscopes could be analyzed with standard automated methods. Following the comments of this reviewer and that of reviewer #3 asking for a systematic evaluation of how much the improvements introduced by aberration correction depend on the analysis pipeline, we removed the PCA/ICA analysis in Figure 3—figure supplement 6 and we systematically evaluated the effect of aberration correction on the output of the analysis in the simulated and experimental data shown in Figure 4 using both the manual segmentation method and an automated segmentation method (e.g., CaImAn).</p><p>In simulated data, we found that with CaImAn the number of ROIs segmented in corrected endoscopes was consistently higher than in uncorrected endoscopes across SNR thresholds (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2A), similarly to what observed with manual segmentation (Figure 4D). Using CaImAn, SNR values of fluorescence events were significantly higher in corrected compared to uncorrected endoscopes (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2B), similarly to what observed with manual segmentation (Figure 4E). Moreover, the linear fit of pairwise correlations as a function of radial position for uncorrected endoscopes had a significantly positive slope (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2C left panel), indicating higher pairwise correlations in lateral compared to more central portions of the FOV. For corrected endoscopes, the slope of the linear fit was not significantly different from zero (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2C right panel). This result is also in line with what we previously observed with manual segmentation (Figure 4G). The description of these novel results is added in the text.</p><p>In experimental data, we found that SNR values of fluorescence events tended to be higher in corrected compared to uncorrected endoscopes (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2D), a trend that was in line with what observed with manual segmentation (Figure 4L). The slope of the linear fit of pairwise correlations as a function of radial position for uncorrected endoscopes was significantly positive (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2E), indicating higher pairwise correlations in lateral compared to more central portions of the FOV. For corrected endoscopes, the slope of the linear fit was not significantly different from zero (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2E). Both results are in line with what previously observed with manual segmentation (Figure 4M).

We thank the reviewer for raising this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The slow imaging rate also leads to higher correlations. Did the authors also collect signals at high frame rates? The basic optical properties would not change at higher rates, but 2-3 Hz is far from typical functional imaging rates. The gains in SNR may be more material at these higher frame rates too. Was it simply a microscope limitation that prohibited faster imaging?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not collect fluorescent signals at frame rates higher than 4 Hz. This was because we aimed at imaging the largest possible FOV and our experimental set up was equipped with regular galvanometric mirrors and not with resonant mirrors. We added a sentence in the text to highlight this limitation of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For Figure 7, It is not clear to me why there should be a bias toward information away from the center assuming (semi) random placement of the GRIN- do the authors think that this is real, or simply a measurement artifact – the center of the FOV is nominally furthest from completely healthy tissue, so the slightly lower information reflects network damage? That would also affect the magnitude (but likely not the fundamental interpretation) of the spatial distribution of cells in the modules.</p></disp-quote><p>At the single cell level, information was evenly distributed across the FOV (Figure 7C). We believe the reviewer’s comment refers to data shown in Figure 7E, which contains data pooled from a population of neurons. In Figure 7E, we observed an increase in the information carried by the population of neurons when we incrementally considered larger populations by adding ROIs at larger radial distances. This does not imply that ROIs away from the center carry higher information, but only that their information sums to the information of more central ROIs in a way that is not purely redundant. We apologize if the description of Figure 7E was confusing, and we edited the text to make it clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this paper, the authors describe a novel approach for improving two-photon imaging through thin GRIN-lens endoscopes by using a nanofabricated corrective lens. They validate the approach with in vitro measurements and simulations, and apply the technique to imaging a variety of samples, most notably somatosensory thalamus in awake, behaving mice.</p><p>The technique seems easy to apply and could advance the state of the art in several labs. Although I haven't done such experiments myself, I know from other groups that experiments are often sorely limited by their field of view. This paper presents an exciting solution to this problem.</p><p>I am enthusiastic about the work, but point out the following issues:</p><p>1) With uncorrected GRIN endoscopes, 3D imaging is possible. Do the corrective lenses affect the axial range that can be scanned this way, and if they do, how does this impact the total of neurons that can be recorded with a corrected vs uncorrected endoscope? Zemax simulations would be sufficient to address this.</p></disp-quote><p>The optical simulations we did to design the corrective lenses were performed maximizing aberration correction only in the focal plane of the endoscope. Following the reviewer’s comment, we explored the effect of aberration correction outside the focal plane using new Zemax simulations. In corrected endoscopes, we found that the Strehl ratio was &gt; 0.8 (Maréchal criterion) in a larger volume compared to uncorrected endoscopes (new Figure 2—figure supplement 3). The range of volume with high Strehl ratio in corrected endoscopes was 1.7-3.7 larger than the volume with high Strehl ratio in uncorrected probes, leading to similarly larger number of neurons being imaged in the enlarged volume. This is now described on lines (paragraph three subsection “Optical simulation of eFOV-microendoscopes”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I think the paper could do a better job of motivating the need for thinner endoscopes, particularly in the Introduction. Figure 5 leaves me wondering whether connections would really be disrupted by a larger endoscope. Figure 3—figure supplement 7 makes it clear that larger endoscopes and cannulae require removing a lot of structures, but the paper leaves it to the reader to imagine the consequences. Have there been published accounts of failure rates for different endoscope sizes? Perhaps your own experiences, or studies of e.g. amygdala or hypothalamus?</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s comment, we modified the Introduction to more clearly motivate the need of thin endoscopic probes for deep brain functional imaging in paragraph two of the Introduction. We are not aware of a systematic description on the impact of different endoscope sizes on the functionality of the targeted brain region, but we have cited relevant literature showing that surgical lesion of reciprocal connectivity alters thalamocortical dynamics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The methods used to segment/analyze calcium imaging data (subsection “Segmentation of simulated time series”) come off as somewhat straw-man. There are a variety of activity-based tools that can separate mixed signals from overlapping cells (PCA/ICA, NMF, CNMF, etc.), and these have been popular for (1P) endoscopic imaging. I wonder if such methods narrow the gap between uncorrected and corrected SNRs and correlations. The statements at the end of paragraph five of the Discussion seem a bit strong if this possibility has not been explored.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s comment we evaluated the effect of aberration correction on the output of the analysis in the simulated and experimental data shown in Figure 4 using both the manual segmentation method and an automated segmentation method (e.g., CaImAn).</p><p>In simulated data, we found that with CaImAn the number of ROIs segmented in corrected endoscopes was consistently higher than in uncorrected endoscopes across SNR thresholds (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2A), similarly to what observed with manual segmentation (Figure 4D).

The authors propose simultaneous functional imaging and optogenetic perturbations with these corrective lenses (Discussion final paragraph), but this would require the correction be useful across a large wavelength range (perhaps ~900nm and ~1040nm), which needs more evidence. Chromatic issues can easily affect 2P imaging even over the bandwidth of a femtosecond laser.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this comment. All optical simulations described in the first submission were performed at a fixed wavelength (λ = 920 nm). Following the reviewer’s request, we explored the effect of changing wavelength on the Strehl ratio using new Zemax simulations. We found that the Strehl ratio remains &gt; 0.8 within ± 15 nm from λ = 920 nm (new Figure 2—figure supplement 4), which covers the limited bandwidth of our femtosecond laser but not that needed for all-optical imaging and manipulation experiments. To perform this latter type of experiments, the SLM that is used in the stimulation pathway should also be used to correct for the z-defocus with an appropriate lens function. Alternatively, future microfabrication work will be needed to design more complex corrective lens design, which efficiently compensates chromatic aberrations in the 900-1100 nm wavelength range. These possibilities are now more clearly discussed (Discussion paragraphs eight and nine).</p></body></sub-article></article>
