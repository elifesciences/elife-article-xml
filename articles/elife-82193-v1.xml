tolerance towards spermatozoa vs. reactivity against pathogens. Thus, normal organ function and integrity relies heavily on a tightly controlled immune balance. Previous studies described inflammation-associated tissue damage solely in the distal regions (corpus, cauda), but not in the proximal regions (initial segment, caput). To understand the observed region-specific immunity along the epididymal duct, we have used an acute bacterial epididymitis mouse model and analyzed the disease progression. Whole transcriptome analysis using RNAseq 10 days post infection showed a pro-inflammatory environment within the cauda, while the caput exhibited only minor transcriptional changes. High-dimensional flow cytometry analyses revealed drastic changes in the immune cell composition upon infection with uropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. A massive influx of neutrophils and monocytes was observed exclusively in distal regions and was associated with bacterial appearance and tissue alterations. In order to clarify the reasons for the region-specific differences in the intensity of immune responses, we investigated the heterogeneity of resident immune cell populations under physiological conditions by scRNASeq analysis of extravascular CD45+ cells. Twelve distinct immune cell subsets were identified, displaying substantial differences in distribution along the epididymis as further assessed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining. Macrophages constituted the majority of resident immune cells and were further separated in distinct subgroups based on their transcriptional profile, tissue location and monocyte-dependence. Crucially, the proximal and distal regions showed striking differences in their immunological landscapes. These findings indicate that resident immune cells are strategically positioned along the epididymal duct, potentially providing different immunological environments required for addressing the contrasting immunological challenges and thus, preserving tissue integrity and organ function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epididymis</kwd><kwd>epididymitis</kwd><kwd>resident immune cells</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>bacterial infection</kwd><kwd>scRNASeq</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRK 1871</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meinhardt</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>von Behring-Roentgen Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>69-0029</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pleuger</surname><given-names>Christiane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A strategical positioning of resident immune cells are key in determining a tightly controlled immune environment in the different regions of the mouse epididymis that creates unique spatial milieus for sperm maturation and combatting invading pathogens.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Within the male reproductive tract, the epididymis plays an essential role in post-testicular sperm maturation and storage. Immotile spermatozoa released from the seminiferous epithelium of the testis enter the epididymis via the efferent ducts and undergo distinct consecutive biochemical maturation processes required to gain motility and fertilization capacities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belleannee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Skerget et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Björkgren and Sipilä, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrachina et al., 2022</xref>). The sequential maturation process is orchestrated by the pseudostratified epithelium composed of several different epithelial (principal, basal, narrow/clear) and immune cell types that creates an unique luminal milieu. The barrier function of the epididymal epithelium highly depends on epithelial integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Breton et al., 2019</xref>). Intraepithelial immune cells, particularly mononuclear phagocytes (MP), are highly abundant within the epididymal epithelium and perform a key role in the preservation of epithelial integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smith et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>From an immunological perspective, the epididymis performs a functionally complex role by providing an immunotolerant environment for transiting immunogenic spermatozoa, while maintaining the capacity to effectively combat invading pathogens ascending from the urethra and vas deferens. Previous investigations in rodents revealed differences in the immune reactions of opposing ends of the epididymis toward ascending bacterial infection and other local and systemic inflammatory stimuli. In this regard, the proximal regions appear to be almost unresponsive, while the distal regions are prone to intense immune responses resulting in persistent tissue damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Michel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Silva et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Klein et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klein et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wijayarathna et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>As the epididymis consists of a single highly convoluted duct that meanders through structurally different regions (initial segment [IS], caput, corpus, cauda), inflammation-associated tissue damage and fibrotic remodeling result in epididymal duct obstruction which has a direct impact on the maturation and passage of sperm and, thereby, fertility. The histopathological observations in rodent models replicate many of the clinical manifestations in epididymitis patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pilatz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fijak et al., 2018</xref>). Epididymitis in humans is mostly caused by urogenital tract infections with coliform bacteria (i.e. uropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> [UPEC]) or pathogens linked to sexually transmitted diseases (e.g. <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pilatz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pleuger et al., 2020</xref>) and can effectively be treated with antibiotics. However, up to 40% of epididymitis patients exhibit a persistent sub- or infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rusz et al., 2012</xref>), most likely due to epididymal duct stenosis/obstruction and concomitant oligo- or azoospermia. The reasons underlying differences in different immune responsiveness, with strong pro-inflammatory immune response largely confined to the cauda, are not well understood.</p><p>Within the last few decades, initial steps have been made in characterizing the immunological landscape within the epididymis and understanding how the epididymis is prepared for its immunological challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nashan et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flickinger et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Serre and Robaire, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Da Silva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pierucci-Alves et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Voisin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battistone et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mendelsohn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). The murine epididymis is populated by various myeloid and lymphoid cell populations that are differentially distributed along the epididymal duct. Subsets of the MP system are the most prominent group within the epididymis and form a dense network within and around the epididymal duct, especially within the IS which is the site of spermatozoa entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Da Silva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battistone et al., 2020</xref>). Generally, the MP system comprises multiple subsets that can share similar cell surface markers, yet possess distinct functions related to tissue homeostasis and pathogen-specific immunity. Despite accumulating information about the localization and antigen presentation and antigen-processing properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Da Silva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Da Silva and Smith, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battistone et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mendelsohn et al., 2020</xref>), the identity of MP subgroups within the epididymis as well as the full extent of their heterogeneity is still not well understood mainly due to the general similarities between macrophage and DC subpopulations. In view of the fundamentally different immunological requirements of the epididymis, maintaining both a stable and immunotolerant microenvironment for sperm maturation in the proximal regions and the ability to mount adequate immune responses toward invading bacteria at the distal end, detailed investigation of the phenotypes, localization, and function of resident immune cells is essential.</p><p>In this regard, we hypothesized that strategically positioned resident immune cells that function as both ‘scavengers’ and ‘guardians’ create distinct immunological landscapes within epididymal regions. These, in turn, are responsible for the observed differences in the intensity of the immune responses toward infectious or inflammatory stimuli as well as for tissue homeostasis and the maintenance of epithelial function that is essential for regulating the sequential steps of sperm maturation. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to both (i) analyze the differential immune responses to UPEC-elicited epididymitis and (ii) uncover the immune diversity among epididymal regions, by using an unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNASeq) analysis complemented by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence analysis to localize identified populations in situ.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Caput and cauda epididymides react fundamentally differently during acute bacterial epididymitis</title><p>To better understand the different immune responses within the epididymal regions and to expand on our previous studies, an experimental bacterial mouse epididymitis model was used to monitor disease progression up to 10 days post infection (p.i., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Bacteria were found in all epididymal regions (IS, caput, corpus, cauda) and in the testis 1 day p.i.

Later time points were not examined, as it is known that bacteria are cleared toward day 30 p.i. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Klein et al., 2019</xref>). In line with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klein et al., 2020</xref>), the caput showed no gross morphological alterations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>), although slight histopathological changes, including mild focal epithelial damage and minor connective tissue deposition within the interstitium, were observed 5 days p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) resulting in an elevated disease score that returned to normal values at 10 days p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In accordance with previous studies from our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klein et al., 2020</xref>) severe tissue remodeling was seen in the cauda (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) characterized by infiltration of immune cells, loss of epithelial integrity, connective tissue deposition in the interstitium, reduction of luminal diameter, and ultimately, epididymal duct destruction resulting in a significantly increased and persistent overall disease score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Initially, immune cell infiltrates were predominantly located peripherally within the cauda (5 days p.i.) before larger leukocytic conglomerates/granulomas developed within the entire cauda region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

In our initial experiments, we confirmed findings from previous studies showing that immunopathological damage following UPEC infection occurs almost exclusively in the cauda epididymidis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Michel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klein et al., 2020</xref>) with loss of epithelial integrity, interstitial fibrosis, and duct obstruction. Expanding on these previous observations, we further demonstrate that the accompanying leukocytic infiltration is characterized by a massive influx of neutrophils and monocyte-derived MHC-II<sup>hi</sup> macrophages with concurrent loss of epithelial integrity. Both neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages are important first defenders of the innate immune response during acute infection due to their high phagocytic activity. However, during immune response against microbes, both populations can also elicit substantial collateral tissue injury by releasing inflammatory and cytotoxic mediators that, in turn, amplify the immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Segel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kruger et al., 2015</xref>). The role of neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages in tissue injury in the cauda has become evident in mice lacking CCR2, which is required for the recruitment of circulating immune cells to inflammatory sites. <italic>Ccr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice show a significantly reduced influx of neutrophils and inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages concomitant with less severe tissue damage in the cauda during UPEC infection compared to wild type mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2021</xref>) pointing to a role as double-edged swords in acute epididymitis by participating in both defense and inflammation-associated tissue damage. Nevertheless, bacterial virulence factors may contribute to some extent to tissue damage in the cauda following the observation that UPEC persist in this region much longer and at higher numbers than in the other parts of the organ. A further driving force of the persisting immunopathology seen in the cauda could relate to the extravasation of immunogenic spermatozoa through the damaged epithelial barrier, which may trigger accumulated MHC-II<sup>hi</sup> macrophages and lymphocytes (B and T cells) toward an adaptive immune response against spermatozoal neo-antigens. This is supported by an increase of B and T cell populations and upregulation of gene sets associated with their activation as well as granuloma formation, indicating a transition from innate to adaptive immune response limited to the cauda. Of note, granulomas can be induced by interstitial sperm injection alone also leading to massive tissue destruction in the cauda epididymidis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Itoh et al., 1999</xref>) and formation of anti-sperm antibodies as seen in another model of <italic>E. coli</italic>-elicited epididymitis and in epididymitis patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ingerslev et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nashan et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lotti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Silva et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Contrasting to the strong pro-inflammatory processes within the cauda, the caput remains mostly unaffected – an observation that previously raised the question whether the caput is either non-responsive or to a lesser extent responsive compared to the cauda. As bacteria are initially present in the caput, albeit at lower numbers and for a shorter time (potentially due to a faster bacterial clearance potential as evidenced by the <italic>ex vivo</italic> approach), it can be excluded that the lower bacterial load is an explanation for the differential immune response in the caput. The very mild and transient immune response in the caput is characterized by the upregulation of a very small number of genes that are indicative of a limited inflammatory response triggered by the pathogens, such as the alarmins <italic>S100a8</italic> and <italic>S100a9</italic>. Interestingly, both alarmins have previously been demonstrated to be upregulated within the kidney and bladder during UPEC-elicited urinary tract infection, but did not substantially contribute to an effective host immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dessing et al., 2010</xref>). Possibly, the upregulation of <italic>S100a9</italic> within the caput could drive macrophages to polarize to an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive phenotype as seen in the testis following UPEC infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fan et al., 2021</xref>). A clear indication for a regionalized immune response with a predominant reaction in the cauda is derived from this and other studies that use an inflammatory stimuli such as LPS that act simultaneously on all regions in vivo and in vitro rather than gradually ascending such as an in vivo UPEC infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Silva et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wijayarathna et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, it is evident that fundamental differences must exist in the immunological milieus of the epididymal regions that most likely rely on leukocyte subpopulations that gradually change in phenotype throughout the organ. Initial evidence came from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Da Silva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Da Silva and Smith, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Da Silva and Barton, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Voisin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battistone et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mendelsohn et al., 2020</xref>). However, the full extent of the heterogeneity of resident immune cells and their identity remained elusive. Our data unravel the transcriptional identity and tissue location of extravascular immune cells and further support the existence of distinct immunological environments along the epididymal duct that are tailored to the respective needs of the microenvironment.</p><p>Overall, macrophages constitute the major immune cell population, especially within the IS. Along the epididymal duct macrophages exhibit a dense network consisting of several transcriptional distinct subpopulations that populate different niches according to their homeostatic, reparative, and inflammatory properties. CX3CR1<sup>hi</sup> macrophages that possess a homeostatic and sensing profile are situated within and around the epididymal epithelium with highest abundance in the IS. Data about the density of these cells in the epididymal regions, however, differ among studies, probably due to methodological differences (see ‘Public Review’ for details, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Voisin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battistone et al., 2020</xref>). The morphological abundance of these macrophages, particularly the exhibition of long dendrites toward the lumen, is consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Da Silva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battistone et al., 2020</xref>). The transcriptional profile of intraepithelial CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> cells combined with the known high phagocytic potential toward apoptotic epithelial cells (i.e. within the IS, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smith et al., 2014</xref>) and pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battistone et al., 2020</xref>) indicates a central function in tissue homeostasis and immune surveillance in order to efficiently maintain epithelial integrity that in turn is mandatory for maintaining the luminal microenvironment required for proper sperm maturation. Of note, the high density of sensing CX3CR1<sup>hi</sup> macrophages in combination with the narrow lumen of the IS indicates a potential function of this region as ‘immunological bottleneck’ in which the luminal content is constantly monitored in order to induce tolerance toward immunogenic sperm antigens and to eliminate pathogens from further ascend to the testis. Whether these immune cells directly influence sperm maturation processes needs to be elucidated. The presence of CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> cells within the IS was previously described, however, were initially related to dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Da Silva et al., 2011</xref>) and subsequently generally as MP based on morphology and partial CD11c expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Da Silva and Smith, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Da Silva and Barton, 2016</xref>). In our study the transcriptional profile clearly indicates a macrophage phenotype with sensing functions.</p><p>In contrast, the distal regions (corpus, cauda) are populated by a more heterogeneous macrophage pool consisting of less intraepithelial CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> macrophages, but higher abundance of interstitial pro-inflammatory monocyte-derived CCR2<sup>+</sup>MHC-II<sup>+</sup>, vasculature-associated TLF<sup>+</sup> macrophages (expressing a combination of <italic>Timd4, Lyve1, Folr2</italic>; marker used in the present study CD163) as well as CX3CR1<sup>-</sup>TLF<sup>-</sup>CCR2<sup>-</sup> macrophages (contained in clusters 7 and 8). The co-existence of these three populations was recently reported to be conserved across organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dick et al., 2022</xref>) and, similar to other organs, the different macrophage pools have distinct monocyte contributions. While TLF<sup>+</sup> macrophages are rather self-renewing and CCR2<sup>+</sup> macrophages monocyte-dependent, TLF<sup>-</sup>CCR2<sup>-</sup> macrophages (including CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> macrophages in our parabiosis experiment with alternating MHC-II levels) are partially dependent on monocytes in distal, but not in proximal epididymal regions. These findings support the conclusion that local environmental factors could influence parameters that regulate monocyte entry and replacement of distinct macrophage populations in different regions of the epididymis.</p><p>The co-existence of antigen-presenting myeloid cell populations (macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells) with lymphocyte subtypes (NK cells, αβ T cells, γδ T cells, B cells) within the distal regions of the epididymis implies an environment of immune responsiveness. As we found a higher proportion of monocytes-derived cells and conventional DC 1 and 2 (including a small fraction of activated <italic>Ccr7</italic><sup>+</sup> DC) within the distal regions, an ongoing antigen sampling and interaction with the draining lymph node can be assumed but would require further confirmation before a better understanding of the region-specific role of migratory myeloid cells in the epididymal immune regulation can be achieved. The existence of intraepithelial and interstitial lymphocyte subpopulations with innate-like characteristics (i.e. NK cells, γδ T cells), predominantly within the distal regions, implies a contribution of these cells to the onset of immune responses against pathogens. Both populations generally function as key responders to barrier stress signals in mucosal tissues and accelerate pro-inflammatory processes by secreting effector cytokines, particularly IL-17- and IFNγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Papotto et al., 2017</xref>). Since the function of innate lymphoid cells highly depends on their activation status and functional polarization within the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonneville et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klose and Artis, 2020</xref>), local environmental factors may determine regulatory vs. cytotoxic functions of NK and γδ T cells in different epididymal regions.</p><p>As a limitation, our scRNASeq approach supplies ‘only’ a snapshot of extravascular immune cells within the epididymis at a defined time (in the adult) neglecting times of residency for, for example, myeloid and lymphoid immune cell populations that possess migratory capabilities and patrol between non-lymphoid tissues and draining lymph nodes, a process required for immune surveillance and induction of immune responses or tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hampton and Chtanova, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Together, our data provide the first atlas of extravascular CD45<sup>+</sup> cells within the murine epididymis under normal conditions. Strategic positioning of identified immune cell populations strongly indicates the existence of distinct immunological landscapes at the opposing ends of the epididymal duct that, in turn, is considered as a main driver for the observed differences in the intensity of immune responsiveness upon bacterial infection. We believe that the data in the present study provide a valuable starting point and common research platform for future studies on the organ-specific function of these populations in epididymal immunity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All mice used in this study were purchased from Charles River and Jackson Laboratories and/or bred under pathogen-free conditions prior to use at the animal facilities of Justus Liebig-University Giessen, Germany (C57BL/6J wild type [Charles River], <italic>Cx3Cr1</italic><sup>GFP</sup><italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>RFP</sup> [JAX ID: 032127, Jackson Laboratories]), The Toronto General Research Institute, Canada (C57BL/6J CD45.1 [JAX ID: 002014], <italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> [JAX ID: 004999]) and the Central Animal Facility at Hannover Medical School (Tcrd-H2BeGFP, JAX ID: 016941).</p><p>All animal experiments were approved by the respective local Animal Ethic Committees (Germany: Regierungspräsidium Giessen GI20/25 No. G60/2017, GI20/25 No. G71/2019, the Nds.

Cells were re-suspended in PBS and stained with a fixable viability dye in order to assess viability (different viability dyes were used depending on the respective panel: ZombieAqua [Biolegend, 423101], ZombieNIR [BioLegend, 423105], Viobility 405/452 Fixable Dye [Miltenyi, 103-109-816]) following the respective manufacturer’s recommendation. To block nonspecific binding of antibodies to mouse cells expressing Fc receptors, cell suspensions were incubated with Fc blocking reagent (Miltenyi, 130-092-575) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Cells were stained with antibodies listed in the Appendix 1—Key resources table for 30 min at 4°C in 50 µl MACS Quant buffer (2 mM EDTA and 0.5% BSA in PBS). Respective controls were used by omitting the target antibody and incubating with the respective isotype control under the same conditions. For the infection analysis, cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with MACS Quant buffer before re-suspension in 200–500 µl MACS Quant buffer (depending on cell numbers). Flow cytometry was performed using a MACSQuant Analyzer 10 (steady-state analysis) and BD LSRFortessa Cell Analyzer (for infection analysis). All obtained data were analyzed with FlowJo software version 10.8.1.

The appropriate volume for droplet generation was assessed by counting live cells using Tryptan Blue staining and a hemocytometer. Reverse transcription was performed in a pre-chilled 96-well plate (heat-sealed) using a Veriti 96-well thermal cycler (Thermo Fisher). cDNA was recovered using 10x-associated Recovery Agent followed by amplification and purification using SPRIselect beads (Beckman) following the manufacturer’s recommendation. After diluting samples in a 4:1 ratio (elution buffer [Qiagen]:cDNA), cDNA concentration was determined using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).</p><p>Sequencing libraries were produced by loading samples on the 10× Chromium. Generated libraries were processed as recommended by the methods provided from 10× Genomics. Expression matrices were generated using Cell Ranger (10× Genomics). Obtained raw base call (BCL) files from the HiSeq2500 sequencer were demultiplexed into FastQ files. Sequencing reads were aligned to the mouse genome/transcriptome (mm10) and counted by StarSolo. After library preparation and cell mapping (StarSolo), 13,015 data points were identified as valid cells (2076 within IS, 3791 within caput, 4523 within corpus, 2625 within cauda). Preprocessed counts were further analyzed using Scanpy. Basic cell quality control was conducted by taking the number of detected genes and mitochondrial content into consideration. In total, 49 cells that did not express at least 300 genes or had a mitochondrial content greater than 10%, were removed. Genes were filtered out if they were detected in less than 30 cells (&lt;0.2%). Raw counts per cell were normalized to the median count over all cells and transformed into log space to stabilize variance. Dimensionality reduction was performed by PCA, retaining 50 principal components. Subsequent steps, for example, low-dimensional UMAP embedding and cell clustering via community detection, were based on the initial PCA. Final data visualization was performed using the Scanpy and CellxGene package.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>Epididymides from <italic>Cx3Cr1</italic><sup>GFP</sup><italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>RFP</sup> reporter mice (JAX ID: 032127, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jung et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saederup et al., 2010</xref>), Tcrd-H2BEGFP (JAX ID: 016941, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Prinz et al., 2006</xref>), and C57BL/6J mice (Charles River) were fixed with ROTIHistofix 4% (Carl Roth, Germany) for 5 hr followed by washing in phosphate buffer and incubation in 30% sucrose overnight at 4°C before embedding in OCT media and storage at –80°C.

Ideally, this should be briefly discussed in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Abstract: Please provide more information about the data presented in this study. As it is currently written the abstract only refers to the single-cell RNA sequencing data in the steady state epididymis.</p><p>1) Flow cytometry experiments) In Figure 2D, the authors should show quantification of the percentages of immune cell subsets relative to live cells, similar to the data shown in Figure 2B for CD45+ cells. As it is, this figure does not support the statement that &quot;Infiltration of neutrophils was followed by an influx of monocytes (Ly6C+ CD11b+, Figure 2D)&quot;. In order to conclude that there was infiltration of these immune cells, the authors should provide quantification of neutrophils and monocytes relative to the total number of live cells analysed. In addition, both these cell populations appear to rise concomitantly following bacterial injection, which does not support the conclusion that monocyte recruitment follows neutrophil recruitment.</p><p>2) Figure 4A: flow cytometry analysis) The data showing higher numbers of CD45+ cells relative to live cells in the IS versus the more distal epididymal segments should be discussed with respect to previous studies. Please specify the region shown in the right panel's IS/CT and CS/CD regions. This is especially important for the IS and CT, which have distinct morphological appearances.</p><p>3) Figure 6C and D: A surprisingly low number of CX3CR1-EGFP cells was detected by immunofluorescence in the cauda. This is not in agreement with previous studies showing a similar % of CX3CR1-EGFP cells in the IS and cauda regions by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. The authors need to discuss this discrepancy. Perhaps the different fixation procedures used in the current study compared to those used in previous studies could account for the loss of EGFP in the epididymis sections. As such, cells that appear to be F4/80 positive but negative for EGFP by immunofluorescence might simply be due to the loss of cytoplasmic EGFP, while F4/80 immunogenicity remained intact (line 415).</p><p>4) Line 265: The strategy to exclude vascular CD45+ cells should be mentioned in the Results section.</p><p>5) Line 315: Please provide a reference to support this statement &quot;Adgre1+C1qa+ cells, broadly considered as epididymal macrophages, constitute the majority of CD45+ cells in the epididymis&quot;.</p><p>6) Line 328 and Figure 5C: The authors state: Adgre1+C1qa+ cells were re-analyzed after exclusion of other CD45+ cells&quot;. They then state: &quot;All identified macrophage subgroups were highly enriched with C1qa and Adgre1 transcripts confirming their macrophage identity (Figure 5D, Figure S5A).&quot; I may have missed something but is it not an obvious result since they had initially selected cells using these markers?</p><p>7) In the Discussion section (line 475), the following statement: &quot;(…) we further demonstrate that the accompanying leukocytic infiltration is characterized by a massive influx of neutrophils and monocyte-derived MHC-IIhi macrophages&quot; is not supported by the data. As stated above, to make this conclusion, flow cytometry analysis of the percentage of neutrophils and macrophages relative to the total number of live cells should be provided.</p><p>8) Line 528: Please cite Mendelsohn et al. AJP Cell Physiol. 2020.</p><p>9) Line 531: The authors state: &quot;Intriguingly, our data revealed that distinct immunological landscapes exist within proximal (IS, caput) and distal regions (corpus, cauda), that are tailored to the respective needs of the microenvironments.&quot; However, they should acknowledge that their results only reinforce previous studies that have already shown the presence of immune cells with markedly distinct phenotypes in the different regions of the epididymis. The way this sentence is written at the moment, the authors seem to imply that this is the first study that describes immune cell heterogeneity in this organ.</p><p>10) Line 534: The conclusion that macrophages constitute the major immune cell population of the murine epididymis is not supported by the data provided here. In fact, the authors found that macrophages account for only approximately 20% of CD45+ immune cells in the cauda (Figure 4B). The authors should, therefore, modify their conclusion to state that macrophages constitute the major immune cell population in the IS. In fact, this conclusion would be more in line with previously published studies.</p><p>11) Line 553: Here again, the statement that the transcriptional profile of CX3CR1+ cells indicates a macrophage phenotype is an over-simplification. Please mention the study by Battistone et al. (MHR 2020) that characterized CX3CR1-positive cells in all segments of the epididymis. In the Battistone study, while several CX3CR1-EGFP+ cells were described as having a macrophage phenotype, some cells had a dendritic cell phenotype, especially in the cauda. The current study actually confirms the previously published higher number of cells with a macrophage phenotype in the IS versus other regions.</p><p>12) Line 555: Please be careful with the statement that fewer intraepithelial CX3CR1-EGFP+ cells are present in the cauda. How were these intraepithelial cells quantified? Here again, the fact that fewer EGFP+ cells were observed in the cauda versus other regions is not in agreement with previous studies. The authors should discuss their results with respect to previous studies indicating that a similar percentage of CX3CR1-EGFP+ cells (with respect to the number of live cells analysed) were detected in the IS and cauda regions, while a higher percentage was detected in the cauda versus the caput/corpus regions (Battistone MHR 2020).</p><p>Other specific comments:</p><p>Line 72-76: the proximal regions appear to be almost unresponsive to which stimuli?</p><p>Lines 136-137: Please mention that a low level of histopathological damage in the caput 10 days post-UPEC injection has been reported previously (Klein et al. MHR 2020).</p><p>Figure 1E: Would it be possible to label bacteria for microscopic assessment in these tissues? If so, the authors should provide these data.</p><p>Figure 2A: Please describe how immune cells were identified and how the area of immune cell infiltrates was quantified.</p><p>Figure 4B-H: Please provide a list of the markers that were used to identify the different cell types by flow cytometry.</p><p>Figure 6C and line 388: Please change &quot;principal cell&quot; by &quot;epithelial cells&quot; since no marker was used to identify these cell types. Previous studies have indicated that immune cells can send their projections not only between principal cells but also next to narrow cells in the IS.</p><p>Method Gating of immune cells under physiological conditions: It is stated that CX3CR1 was used as a positive marker of macrophages. However, previous studies showed that dendritic cells can also express this marker. This caveat should be mentioned.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82193.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Please address the following concerns:</p><p>1) The strategic positioning of resident immune cells should function in two aspects: facilitating sperm maturation and infection prevention.

In this regard, we were able to show that distinct populations reside within the epididymis and reveal striking differences in their regional distribution. At this current stage, we cannot provide further experimental evidence for the direct or indirect influence of particular immune cell populations on sperm maturation. As stated in the public comment, this would require several comprehensive experimental approaches using transgenic mouse models in which particular immune cell populations are selectively depleted followed by functional sperm analysis (i.e. motility/ vitality assessment, capacitation and fertilization competencies) and assessment of putative inflammatory responses (formation of anti-sperm antibodies, region-specific expression of inflammatory mediators).</p><p>Yet, our data strongly support that resident immune cells differently populate the epididymal regions and are likely involved in tissue maintenance. Based on the transcriptional identity of the identified cell types combined with the current knowledge of function of particular immune cell subpopulations derived from other organs combined with their location within the epididymal regions (intraepithelial/ periductal/ interstitial), we are confident to predict their general function (homeostatic vs. inflammatory). For example, combining our data with previous reports, especially on intraepithelial CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> cells (Smith et al., 2014; Battistone et al., 2020), evidence is given that these cells are indispensable for maintaining epithelial integrity, that in turn, is mandatory for preserving the luminal microenvironment and potentially protecting luminal spermatozoa from autoimmune reactions.</p><p>To address the reviewer’s point, we have extended the respective part about intraepithelial CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> cells in the discussion (line 573-575) stating that the maintenance of epithelial integrity is mandatory to maintain the luminal microenvironment required for proper sperm maturation.

This administration route mimics the clinical situation best as in bacterial epididymitis (in contrast to viral orchitis) urogenital pathogens are ascending canalicularly through the male urogenital tract.</p><p>In the pathological setting, bacteria do not settle the testis first and then ‘descend’ from the testis to the epididymis. Moreover, it would technically be very demanding to first expose, then inject into the efferent ducts or rete testis both of which have a considerably smaller lumen than the vas deferens and particularly in the latter case an interstitial injection cannot be excluded.</p><p>The aim of the <italic>ex vivo</italic> model was to confirm that the observed regional differences in our approach is not only due to the ascending nature of the model and thus, a longer exposure of the cauda to the pathogens compared to other regions. An injection into the proximal sites, e.g. efferent duct or rete testis (instead of injecting into the distal sites), would therefore not answer this particular question as another gradient would be generated (high pathogen concentration in the proximal part and low concentration in the distal part). The advantage of the ex vivo model is the simultaneous exposure to the inflammatory insult which excludes variable time or magnitude of stimulus.</p><p>Of note, a region-specific magnitude of immune response independent of the administration route was also seen in models by other groups by employing systemic inflammation (Wang et al., 2019) as well as an autoimmune-based disease model (Wijayarathna et al., 2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Abstract does not reflect what had been done in this study and thus, should be revised to include all major experiments and their collective conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rephrased the abstract and included more details about the experimental approaches.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Does this study have any clinical implications?

In order to conclude that there was infiltration of these immune cells, the authors should provide quantification of neutrophils and monocytes relative to the total number of live cells analysed.

The authors need to discuss this discrepancy. Perhaps the different fixation procedures used in the current study compared to those used in previous studies could account for the loss of EGFP in the epididymis sections. As such, cells that appear to be F4/80 positive but negative for EGFP by immunofluorescence might simply be due to the loss of cytoplasmic EGFP, while F4/80 immunogenicity remained intact (line 415).</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the response to the respective public comment (comment 3 in the public review), where we have addressed this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Line 265: The strategy to exclude vascular CD45+ cells should be mentioned in the Results section.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a brief description of the strategy connecting to the respective figures (Figure 3A, figure 3 – Supplement 1).

In fact, this conclusion would be more in line with previously published studies.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the response in the respective comment within the public review:</p><p>We fully agree with the reviewer and have changed the conclusion to “macrophages constitute the major immune cell population, especially in the IS” (line 559-560).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Line 553: Here again, the statement that the transcriptional profile of CX3CR1+ cells indicates a macrophage phenotype is an over-simplification. Please mention the study by Battistone et al. (MHR 2020) that characterized CX3CR1-positive cells in all segments of the epididymis. In the Battistone study, while several CX3CR1-EGFP+ cells were described as having a macrophage phenotype, some cells had a dendritic cell phenotype, especially in the cauda. The current study actually confirms the previously published higher number of cells with a macrophage phenotype in the IS versus other regions.</p></disp-quote><p>A classification of these cells based on their structure presents not a very suitable tool to discriminate it from dendritic cells. This is exemplified by macrophages of the testis where two distinct subpopulations of macrophages exist with distinct morphologies (peritubular macrophages: flat and stellate shape similar to DC interstitial macrophages: more compact with partial exhibition of protrusions). Another example are CX3CR1-expressing microglia, highly specialized macrophages of the brain that exhibit a very typical stellate morphology (again similar to DC) in shape that is required for their homeostatic and sensing function. Therefore, the shape of a mononuclear phagocyte is not a reliable criteria for assessing their identity. For this purpose, we decided to perform a scRNASeq approach as a most powerful tool to identify a differential transcriptional profile of extravascular CD45<sup>+</sup> cells, thus allowing a discrimination into classes and subtypes of mononuclear cells. Following clustering and analysis of the gene expression profiles, we have categorized these cells as macrophages characterized by their transcriptional profile, i.e. expression of established macrophage markers [C1qa, Adgre1, Fcgr1] with concomitant lack of DC markers [Flt3, Clec9a Cd209a]. Consequently, we regard these cells as clearly distinct from the identified dendritic cell populations (data shown in Figure 3)</p><p>As stated in the manuscript, intraepithelial CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> macrophages of the epididymis actually possess a microglia-like transcriptional profile (see figure 5E and respective text passage). Therefore, it is plausible that these cells exhibit protrusions that facilitate a sampling function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Line 555: Please be careful with the statement that fewer intraepithelial CX3CR1-EGFP+ cells are present in the cauda. How were these intraepithelial cells quantified? Here again, the fact that fewer EGFP+ cells were observed in the cauda versus other regions is not in agreement with previous studies. The authors should discuss their results with respect to previous studies indicating that a similar percentage of CX3CR1-EGFP+ cells (with respect to the number of live cells analysed) were detected in the IS and cauda regions, while a higher percentage was detected in the cauda versus the caput/corpus regions (Battistone MHR 2020).</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the response to the respective comment within the public review.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other specific comments:</p><p>Line 72-76: the proximal regions appear to be almost unresponsive to which stimuli?</p></disp-quote><p>In the prior sentence, it is stated:</p><p>“Previous investigations in rodents revealed differences in the immune reactions at the opposing ends of the epididymis following ascending bacterial infection and other inflammatory stimuli.

However, previous studies showed that dendritic cells can also express this marker. This caveat should be mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>Generally, CX3CR1 is a receptor that can be expressed by several myeloid cell populations. Initial observations indeed suggested that CX3CR1 is also expressed on the surface of dendritic cells and is required for their function and development (Łyszkiewicz et al., 2011). However, more recent experiments have revealed that CX3CR1 is exclusively expressed by monocyte precursors and monocyte-derived DC (Sutti et al., 2015; Sutti et al., 2019) which represents a developmentally distinct DC population only present during inflammation (Bosteels et al., 2020).</p><p>In terms of epididymal mononuclear phagocytes, the identity of resident CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> cells remained for a long time not fully clarified (as stated within the discussion of the present manuscript). CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> cells (at least a fraction of this heterogeneous cell pool) in the epididymis were originally classified as ‘dendritic cells’ due to their shpae and later more generally as ‘mononuclear phagocytes’. A major outcome of our study is that our scRNASeq data strongly point out that these cells possess a macrophage identity, an aspect that is stated in the discussion and based on the transcriptional profile and expression of key macrophage lineage markers.</p><p>This conclusion based on data seen in Figure 3D showing the expression of Cx3cr1 in macrophage clusters [1, 2, 7], less in monocyte clusters [8, 10] and barely in DC clusters is also in line with the above mentioned publications ((Bosteels et al., 2020) Therefore, we have integrated CX3CR1 in a panel of markers that also included CD45, F4/80, MHC-II, CD11b, CCR2, CD163) for flow cytometry analysis of macrophages, avoiding the use of CX3CR1 as a single positive marker. This panel was designed based on our single cell RNA sequencing data in which several markers were identified to be critical for separating closely related subpopulations (see Figure 3 and 5).
