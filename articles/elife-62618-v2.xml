However, the source of the inhibitory inputs to SACs and how this inhibition confers noise resilience of DSGCs are unknown.

This preservation of inhibition by a disinhibitory motif arises from the interaction between visually evoked network dynamics and short-term synaptic plasticity at the SAC-DSGC synapse.

A major effort in neuroscience is to search for unifying principles of neural computation that can be used to analyze and predict input-output relationships of diverse brain circuits. One approach to achieve this goal is to dissect complex circuitry into elementary building blocks, often termed microcircuit motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Braganza and Beck, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cajal, 1937</xref>). These motifs consist of a small number of neurons that are connected in characteristic patterns and are thought to perform defined algorithmic functions in neuronal signal processing across brain regions. With this paradigm, a given large-scale circuit can be analyzed by mapping the computations of its individual motifs from which the entire circuit is assembled.</p><p>When two inhibitory interneurons and a principal excitatory neuron are serially connected, they form a microcircuit that is commonly designated as a ‘disinhibitory’ motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Activation of the first interneuron is thought to suppress the activity of the second interneuron, causing diminished inhibition of the principal neuron (i.e. disinhibition). Disinhibitory microcircuits are prominently involved in sensory processing, learning, and memory in the neocortex and the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Letzkus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pfeffer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pi et al., 2013</xref>), and in action selection in basal ganglia (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chevalier and Deniau, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Letzkus et al., 2015</xref>). Their functions in these diverse circuits have so far been exclusively attributed to their disinhibitory influences on the principal neurons by relieving the principal neurons from ongoing inhibition.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>On-Off DSGCs in <italic>Gabra2</italic> cKO mice show reduced direction selectivity and reduced null-direction inhibition in the noisy background.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Organization of a canonical disinhibitory microcircuit.

On-Off type DSGCs, a major type of retinal output neuron with directionally tuned spiking activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barlow and Levick, 1965</xref>), receive directional inhibition from starburst amacrine cells (SACs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Briggman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Euler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fried et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Taylor and Vaney, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wei et al., 2011</xref>). SACs themselves receive inhibitory inputs from neighboring SACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kostadinov and Sanes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee and Zhou, 2006</xref>) and wide-field amacrine cells (WACs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2019</xref>), and therefore participate in WAC-SAC-DSGC and SAC-SAC-DSGC ‘disinhibitory’ motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). When both these motifs are disrupted in a conditional knockout mouse line in which GABA-A receptor a2 subunit is selectively removed from SACs (<italic>Gabra2</italic> cKO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Auferkorte et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref> schematic), the direction selectivity of On-Off DSGCs is differentially affected in a visual stimulus-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). The responses of On-Off DSGCs to the leading edge of a bright moving bar (On responses) in <italic>Gabra2</italic> cKO mice show normal direction selectivity when the bar moves against a homogeneous gray background. However, when the bar moves against a ‘noisy’ background of a randomly flickering checkerboard, DSGC On responses show impaired direction selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, in the On pathway, inhibitory input to SACs is not required for the implementation of direction selectivity, but is specifically required for the robustness of this selectivity when flickering noise is present in the motion background. However, the microcircuit motif, as well as the underlying neural mechanism of this noise resilience, is not known.</p><p>In this study, we identified the SAC-SAC-DSGC microcircuit as the motif that underlies the noise resilience of direction selectivity in the On pathway. Combining genetic, functional and computational modeling approaches, we found that instead of disinhibiting DSGCs, this motif preserves motion-evoked DSGC inhibition in the noisy background, thereby preserving the direction selectivity of the DSGC. This unexpected, inverted algorithm leverages the center-surround receptive field (RF) of SACs, and results from the interaction between visual noise-generated network dynamics and short-term plasticity at the SAC-DSGC synapse. Our study therefore highlights the flexibility of neural computations by well-defined circuit components, which can be dramatically influenced by interactions of network activity patterns and synaptic plasticity mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Effect of removing a disinhibitory motif</title><p>In <italic>Gabra2</italic> cKO mice, GABAergic inputs to SACs are selectively eliminated while the rest of retinal inhibitory circuitry remains intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref> schematic). When probed with a moving bar against a gray background, the direction selectivity of On-Off DSGC On spiking responses in <italic>Gabra2</italic> cKO mice was not impaired compared to that in control mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–e</xref>). However, when the background of the moving bar was a randomly flickering checkerboard (see Materials and methods), motion-evoked On spiking activity was increased in the anti-preferred, or null direction, resulting in reduced direction selectivity as measured by the direction selectivity index (DSI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–d and f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The enhanced null-direction spiking triggered by the moving bar in the DSGCs of the <italic>Gabra2</italic> cKO group was due to attenuated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) of DSGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g–j</xref>), which come from the GABAergic outputs of SACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Briggman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fried et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Taylor and Vaney, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wei et al., 2011</xref>). But in the baseline period before the onset of the moving bar, the flickering checkerboard-evoked DSGC IPSCs in the control and cKO groups had similar amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, the excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) of the DSGC, which originate predominantly from glutamatergic bipolar cells during this noisy bar stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), were not affected compared to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, also see Supplemental Discussion on the contributions of glutamatergic and cholinergic excitation to DSGC with noise-free and noisy backgrounds). Therefore, GABAergic inputs onto SACs are important for the noise resilience of DSGC direction selectivity by preserving the strength of directionally tuned inhibition from SACs to DSGCs during motion over a noisy background.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Surround suppression of SAC by neighboring SACs</title><p>Since GABAergic inhibition of SACs represents the canonical ‘disinhibitory’ motif for the principal neuron DSGC, one would predict that inhibition of the DSGC by SACs would be enhanced when GABAergic inputs to SACs are removed in <italic>Gabra2</italic> cKO mice.

To further investigate this unexpected effect, we recorded the somatic membrane potential (V<sub>m</sub>) of SACs during moving bar stimuli with noise-free and noisy backgrounds. In control animals, the bar entering the SAC’s RF surround with a noise-free background evoked a brief period of membrane hyperpolarization prior to the depolarizing response evoked by the bar crossing the RF center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, left trace). Similar patterns of SAC surround suppression have been observed in the rabbit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee and Zhou, 2006</xref>). In the presence of flickering noise, control SACs exhibited flicker-evoked membrane depolarization (termed ‘flicker response’) during the baseline period before the onset of motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, right trace).

We formulated a working hypothesis based on the following two observations described in the previous section: (1) SACs in <italic>Gabra2</italic> cKO mice show increased flicker-evoked activation during the time window immediately before their motion-evoked responses and (2) motion-evoked SAC depolarization is not impaired in the <italic>Gabra2</italic> cKO mice.

Short-term depression at the SAC-DSGC GABAergic synapse has been demonstrated in P7-14 animals during development using paired pulse stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morrie and Feller, 2015</xref>). To examine if this synaptic depression also occurs in the mature retina, we performed paired voltage clamp recordings from SAC-DSGC pairs in adult control mice. SACs were depolarized with a short voltage step, which led to the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) shown as an inward peak that was time-locked with the postsynaptic response of DSGCs and was blocked by VGCC antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koren et al., 2017</xref>).

To address this question, we performed paired SAC-DSGC somatic recordings in control mice during which the presynaptic SAC was voltage clamped according to waveforms that mimic the activation patterns of control and cKO SACs during moving bar stimuli. Since the neurotransmitter release sites of the axonless SAC are located in the distal dendrites, we first used computational modeling to estimate V<sub>m</sub> at the SAC distal dendrites based on SAC somatic V<sub>m</sub> recordings during visual stimulation. A biophysical model of the SAC was constructed based on the digitized morphology of a typical mouse SAC, bipolar cell inputs mapped by connectomic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2016</xref>) and experimentally measured SAC membrane properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stincic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, see Materials and methods). Simulation of SAC activation during a moving bar over the flickering checkerboard indicated that the peak amplitudes of the somatic and distal dendritic V<sub>m</sub> are comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Next, we modeled the degree of attenuation between somatic and distal dendritic compartments during our voltage clamp experiments using parameters that approximate the voltage clamp conditions in the absence of sodium and potassium conductances. Due to the electrotonic isolation of distal SAC dendrites from the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Euler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koren et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tukker et al., 2004</xref>), we estimated the membrane depolarization at SAC dendritic tips by computational modeling to be about 25% of somatic depolarization in the whole-cell voltage-clamp configuration used in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Therefore, we scaled the somatic V<sub>m</sub> traces obtained during current clamp recordings by a factor of 4. The scaled waveforms were then used as the command potentials of SACs in paired voltage-clamp recording experiments so that the V<sub>m</sub> at distal SAC dendrites could be depolarized to a level comparable to that during visual stimulation.

The other waveform was identical to the above cKO pattern except during the time window preceding the motion-evoked response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, time window 2) to include the surround suppression period. During this time window, the noisy V<sub>m</sub> pattern of the cKO SAC was replaced by the mean V<sub>m</sub> pattern of SACs in the control group. The second waveform is termed ‘control pattern’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, upper black trace). For each SAC-DSGC pair, the cKO and the control V<sub>m</sub> waveforms were randomly chosen to voltage-clamp the SAC somatic V<sub>m</sub>, while the DSGC IPSCs were recorded simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Since the flicker-induced membrane fluctuations during the baseline period are identical for cKO and control patterns, the DSGC IPSCs during this baseline period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, time window 1) served as an internal control for each pair for ensuring stable recordings and monitoring potential run-down of whole-cell recordings. As expected, the DSGC IPSC amplitudes during the baseline period for the cKO and control patterns were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and b</xref>, time window 1). However, DSGC IPSCs triggered by the motion-evoked SAC waveforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and b</xref>, time window 3) were significantly different between the cKO and the control patterns. Even though the SAC was activated by the same motion-evoked depolarization pattern during time window 3, a more active V<sub>m</sub> immediately before motion-evoked depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and b</xref>, time window 2) in the cKO waveform led to smaller DSGC IPSC peak amplitudes evoked by the motion waveform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–d</xref>, time window 3). We compared the IPSCs in this paired recording protocol with those during the noisy bar visual stimulation. The peak amplitude and charge transfer of IPSCs in paired recordings are in the lower end of the range for DSGC IPSCs evoked by the noisy bar stimulus (charge transfer: light-evoked: preferred direction: 95.1+ / - 8.6 pA*s; null direction, 198.6 + / - 22.5 pA*s, 16 cells; paired recordings: 100+ 12.1 pA*s, 22 cells; amplitude: light-evoked: preferred direction: 284.2 + / - 23.2 pA; null direction, 570.3 + / - 52.7 pA; paired recordings: 174.5 + / - 17.9 pA), supporting that the measured DSGC inhibitory currents in the paired recordings are within the physiological range.

As expected, we observed speed-dependent duration of SAC surround suppression in the sub-millisecond range over these speeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e and f</xref>). Under noisy conditions, cKO SACs exhibited enhanced noise response during the surround suppression window at all speeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then performed paired SAC-DSGC recordings in control mice using representative cKO Vm waveforms from SACs during the noisy bar stimuli at different speeds. We found that for all three speeds, when random flickering checkerboard-evoked SAC activation fell in the SAC surround suppression time window, it could lead to reduced motion-evoked DSGC IPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g and h</xref>). These results are consistent with the paired pulse experiment of SAC-DSGC recordings that indicate short-term depression occurs at a comparable time scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Together, these results strongly support the hypothesis that in <italic>Gabra2</italic> cKO mice, flicker-evoked SAC depolarization immediately preceding motion-evoked depolarization induces short-term depression at the SAC-DSGC GABAergic synapse, and thereby leads to reduced DSGC inhibition evoked by the moving bar.</p><p>Considering the extensive network of interconnected SACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee and Zhou, 2006</xref>), one might ask whether synaptic depression attenuates the hyperpolarization of a SAC by its neighboring SACs in the presence of object motion with background noise. Consistent with this hypothesis, we did observe a weakened hyperpolarization of the SAC with the noisy background compared to the noise-free background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref> versus 2 hr). However, even though GABA release from SACs is depressed with a noisy background, object motion in the visual field still triggers sufficient GABA release from many neighboring SAC varicosities to suppress noise responses in the postsynaptic SAC just ahead of the moving object.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study revealed an unexpected algorithm of the SAC-SAC-DSGC disinhibitory motif that mediates the noise resilience of retinal direction selectivity. In contrast to the stereotypical disinhibitory function that has been conventionally assumed for this canonical motif, the SAC-SAC-DSGC motif preserves motion-evoked inhibition of DSGCs by preventing the SAC-DSGC GABAergic synapse from acquiring visual noise-induced short-term synaptic depression. This computation arises from the concerted action of three mechanistic components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>): (1) The lateral inhibition between neighboring SACs creates a SAC RF surround that is strongly engaged by visual motion. (2) A moving object entering the SAC RF surround transiently suppresses visual noise-evoked SAC activation prior to motion-evoked RF center response; (3) The SAC-DSGC GABAergic synapse exhibits short-term synaptic depression on a timescale that matches that of visual noise-triggered network dynamics. Our findings highlight that visual motion stimuli across the center-surround RF elicit characteristic temporal activity profiles in visual neurons that can influence synaptic plasticity mechanisms. The modulation of short-term synaptic plasticity in turn profoundly impacts the computational algorithm of the microcircuit in a context-dependent manner.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Mechanisms underlying the preservation of motion-evoked DSGC inhibition by the SAC-SAC-DSGC disinhibitory motif.</title><p>The inverted algorithm of the SAC-SAC-DSGC disinhibitory motif arises from three mechanistic components during motion processing in the noisy background. The SAC-SAC inhibition contributes to a strong RF surround of SACs (1), which enables motion-evoked suppression of SAC Vm that dampens SAC flicker response (2). Dampened SAC flicker response before its motion-evoked response prevents short-term synaptic depression of the SAC-DSGC synapse during motion stimuli (3) and preserves the strength of null-direction inhibition of the DSGC (see more in Discussion).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-62618-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><p>What is the operating range of the ‘inverted’ algorithm of disinhibitory motif in the extensive parameter space of natural motion stimuli? The answer to this question requires a thorough understanding of the interaction between stimulus-driven network dynamics and synaptic plasticity rules of circuit motifs. In this study, noise resilience is explored with a pattern of randomly flickering checkerboard that aims to effectively activate bipolar cells to feed ‘noise’ into the input end of the motion circuit in the IPL. While many other stimulus conditions await testing, the current set of experiments provides a mechanistic understanding of signal processing by this motif and indicates the SAC surround suppression provides a ‘protective’ time window to prevent noise-evoked activation from occurring immediately before motion-evoked activation in the SAC, which would otherwise depress its motion-evoked neurotransmitter release. This function does not necessitate that the SAC-DSGC synapse be chronically depressed by the baseline noise before the onset of motion-evoked surround suppression. Therefore, this function does not critically depend on the recovery from existing depression during the surround suppression window.</p><p>It is notable that the duration of SAC surround suppression varies with motion speed. At higher speeds, the surround suppression window could be too short to separate the noise response from the motion response, so that synaptic depression could occur even with intact SAC-SAC inhibition in wild-type mice. We reasoned that the more depressed motion-evoked release of <italic>Gabra2</italic> cKO SACs is not only due to less recovery from synaptic depression, but is likely also due to further depression by the extra noise activity within the surround suppression window. When we selected <italic>Gabra2</italic> cKO SAC voltage traces that contained the ‘unwanted’ noise activation within this shorter window as command waveforms in paired recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>, lower panel), we observed more severe synaptic depression of the SAC-DSGC synapse than with the control waveform. Therefore, the SAC-SAC inhibition is still effective in shielding the SAC from further depression by noise activity within the ~150 ms window prior to the motion response. The persistence of the protective role of SAC-SAC inhibition at the higher speed suggests that the short period immediately before the motion response plays an important role in shaping the motion-evoked SAC transmitter release.</p><p>Together, the RF structure and synaptic plasticity of SACs suggest predictable and testable limits of the visual stimulus parameters for the noise resilience function of this disinhibitory motif. While this study does not address the questions of how the SAC-mediated disinhibitory motif impacts visual processing at the population level or the consequences for vision, we believe the results will be useful to aid future studies to address how different visual stimuli trigger different patterns of spatiotemporal network activity at the level of synaptic circuitry, and recruit short-term synaptic plasticity at individual synapses.</p><p>In this study, we focused on the On pathway of the direction-selective circuit, which depends on the synaptic interactions between On SACs and the On dendritic layer of the bistratified On-Off DSGCs. In the Off pathway, the SAC-SAC-DSGC motif is also present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2016</xref>), and may play a similar role in preserving DSGC direction selectivity under noisy conditions as in the On pathway. However, eliminating inhibitory inputs onto Off SACs in <italic>Gabra2</italic> cKO mice leads to impaired direction selectivity of DSGCs even in the absence of visual noise in the background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2016</xref>), making it difficult to unambiguously separate the roles of lateral inhibition motifs in the generation versus the noise resilience of direction selectivity in the Off pathway. Different functional contributions of anatomically symmetric motifs for the direction-selective responses to bright and dark motion stimuli suggest context-dependent neural computations by the ‘hardwired’ retinal circuitry.</p><p>In addition to the inhibition from neighboring SACs, wide-field amacrine cells also contribute to the surround inhibition of SACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee and Zhou, 2006</xref>). We found that in the absence of SAC-SAC inhibition in Vgat cKO mice, wide-field inhibition of the SAC was not strong enough to significantly suppress the noise response of the SAC in our noisy bar stimulus that was presented to a retinal area of 660 um in diameter. It is possible that more extensive stimuli may trigger stronger wide-field inhibition to further facilitate noise suppression. It has been shown that the wide-field inhibition of SACs is sensitive to the continuity of moving edges, and thereby confers contextual modulation of pDSGC spiking response to compound gratings that differ between center and surround regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, wide-field amacrine cell inputs to SACs might mainly serve a different function of detecting discontinuities while the SAC-SAC inhibition mediates strong surround suppression prior to the approaching motion.</p><p>The mechanistic components underlying the inverted role of disinhibition in our study are broadly relevant to brain circuitry within and beyond the retina. For example, surround suppression of inhibitory neurons by lateral inhibition is widely observed in both retinal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eggers and Lukasiewicz, 2010</xref>) and cortical circuits (e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ayaz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pecka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pi et al., 2013</xref>]). The prevalence of disinhibitory motifs, synaptic plasticity at multiple time scales, and context-dependent network dynamics raises the possibility that this motif can implement a richer set of neural computations beyond disinhibition in other brain regions such as cortex and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pakan et al., 2016</xref>). For example, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) + interneurons, which are known to inhibit other inhibitory neurons in the neocortex and hippocampus, have been shown to play important roles in gating and gain control during sensory and cognitive processing. Although the VIP interneuron-mediated disinhibitory motif differs from the SAC-mediated motif in many specific aspects such as cellular physiology, embedded networks, and input signals, the VIP interneuron-mediated motif is subject to the same influence of ongoing network activity and short-term plasticity, and therefore is likely susceptible to similar algorithmic flexibility as depicted mechanistically in the current study. We further postulate that context-dependent computation is likely a general property of microcircuit motifs in the brain because synaptic plasticity and network activity patterns are universal and fundamental elements of brain circuits that exert mutual influences onto each other. Future studies that explore the interplay between synaptic plasticity and network dynamics in circuit analysis and modeling will improve our understanding and prediction of the input-output relationships of diverse brain circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">wild-type (C57BL/6J) mice</td><td valign="top">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Chat-IRES-Cre (129S6-<italic>Chat<sup>tm2(cre)Lowl</sup></italic>/J) mice</td><td valign="top">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:006410">IMSR_JAX:006410</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">floxed tdTomato (129S6-<italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm9(CAG-tdTomato)Hze</sup></italic>/J) mice</td><td valign="top">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:007905">IMSR_JAX:007905</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Drd4-GFP (SW-Tg(Drd4-EGFP)W18Gsat/Mmnc) mice</td><td valign="top">MMRRC</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MMRRC_000231-UNC">MMRRC_000231-UNC</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Gabra2</italic> <sup>flox/flox</sup> mice</td><td valign="top">Gift from Dr. Uwe Rudolph, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Auferkorte et al., 2012</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>t flox/flox</sup>(<italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>tm1Lowl</sup>/J) mice</td><td valign="top">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:012897">IMSR_JAX:012897</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">D-AP5</td><td valign="top">Tocris</td><td valign="top">Cat#0106;

The retina was then isolated under infrared illumination at room temperature in oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>) Ames’ medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Isolated retinas were then cut into dorsal or ventral pieces and mounted on top of a 1–2 mm<sup>2</sup> hole in a small piece of filter paper (Millipore, Billerica, MA) with ganglion-cell-layer up.

Visual stimuli were generated by MATLAB and Psychophysics Toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brainard, 1997</xref>), and focused on the photoreceptor layer through the condenser lens of the microscope. A positive-contrast bar (110 µm wide, 385 µm long) moved along the long axis and was presented in 8 or 12 pseudo-randomly chosen directions over an area of 660 µm in diameter. Unless otherwise noted, the bar traveled at a speed of 440 µm/s on the retina, or about 15° visual angle/s. Three to five trials were recorded for each moving direction. The intensity of the moving bar was ~6.3×10<sup>4</sup> isomerizations (R<sup>*</sup>)/rod/s, in the photopic range. For the noise-free background, the intensity of background was ~1800 R<sup>*</sup>/rod/s, at the lower end of photopic range. For the noisy background, the noise was generated as a randomly flickering checkerboard. Individual checks were 55 µm x 55 µm in size, with intensity at either background (0) or ~1×10<sup>4</sup> R<sup>*</sup>/rod/s drawn from a binomial distribution. The checkerboard pattern was refreshed at 15 Hz. For each sweep, the flickering checkerboard pattern was randomly generated. Therefore, flickering checker board patterns differed between individual repetitions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Two-photon guided recording of fluorescence-positive neurons for light response</title><p>The retinas were perfused with oxygenated Ames at 33–34°C during recordings. Drd4-GFP positive DSGCs or tdTomato positive SACs were identified using a two-photon microscope (Bruker Nano Surface Division) and a Ti: sapphire laser (Coherent Chameleon Ultra II) tuned to 920 nm. Then cells were visualized with infrared light (&gt;900 nm) and an IR-sensitive video camera (Watec). The inner limiting membrane was removed with an empty glass electrode to expose the targeted cell. For loose-patch recording of spikes, an electrode of 3–5 MΩ was filled with filtered Ames’ medium. For voltage-clamp whole cell recording of On-Off DSGCs, the recording electrode was filled with a cesium-based internal solution containing 110 mM CsMeSO<sub>4</sub>, 2.8 mM NaCl, 4 mM EGTA, 5 mM TEA-Cl, 4 mM adenosine 5′-triphosphate (magnesium salt), 0.3 mM guanosine 5′-triphosphate (trisodium salt), 20 mM HEPES, 10 mM phosphocreatine (disodium salt), 5 mM N-Ethyllidocaine chloride (QX314), 0.025 mM Alexa 488 (for SACs), and 0.025 mM Alexa 594 (for pDSGCs), pH 7.25. Light evoked IPSCs and EPSCs of DSGCs were isolated by holding cells at 0 mV and −60 mV, respectively. Space clamp is an intrinsic limitation of the voltage clamp method. However, voltage clamp recordings of synaptic currents in On-Off DSGCs have been carefully examined by multiple experimental and modeling studies. While space clamp is still an issue at distal dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Percival et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poleg-Polsky and Diamond, 2011</xref>), light-evoked EPSCs and IPSCs of DSGCs measured by somatic voltage clamp recordings have been taken to well approximate at least the proximal synaptic inputs based on pharmacological and conductance analysis (e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cafaro and Rieke, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Taylor and Vaney, 2002</xref>).

We used a previously digitized mouse SAC morphology and estimated membrane parameters (V<sub>rest</sub>−70 mV, R<sub>i</sub> 40 Ωcm, R<sub>m</sub> for proximal dendrites 9.2e3 Ωcm<sup>2</sup>, R<sub>m</sub> for distal varicosities 20e3 Ωcm<sup>2</sup> and Cm 0.9 µF/cm<sup>2</sup>) for the SAC model from this and previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stincic et al., 2016</xref>). Sodium and potassium channels were blocked (i.e. not included). Bipolar cell inputs were created in a semi-random pattern onto the SAC dendritic tree within 100 µm of the SAC soma based the spacing and subcellular distribution patterns of bipolar cell inputs onto SACs reported in the connectomic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2016</xref>). The checkerboard stimulus had a check size of 12.5 µm and the moving bar width along the direction of motion, 110 µm. Bipolar cell activation was simulated as step depolarizations for the duration of the stimuli over the bipolar cell’s RF. The membrane potential in the bipolar cells was set 7 mV above the threshold for synaptic release, approximately −45 mV. The bipolar synapses had tonic release and an exponential release function with a gain of 6 mV/e-fold change, and during the noise stimulus they (~10 per SAC dendrite) each had a conductance that varied between 20 and 50 pS. The model computed the SAC dendritic V<sub>m</sub> evoked by a bar moving in the centrifugal direction to estimate the SAC dendritic activation levels during motion in the DSGC's null direction. For simulation of V<sub>m</sub> attenuation from soma to distal dendrites of SAC during paired voltage-clamp recording, bipolar cell inputs were removed from the model. Models were run on an array of 3.2 GHz AMD Opteron CPUs interconnected by Gigabit ethernet, on the Mosix parallel distributed task system under the Linux operating system.

Neurons were visualized with transmitted visible light from a halogen bulb. The preferred direction of Drd4-GFP-positive DSGCs was noted for each retina piece. tdTomato-positive SACs and Drd4-GFP-positive pDSGCs were identified with epifluorescence imaging (X-Cite) under a water immersion 60x objective. SACs located on the null side of DSGCs with overlapping dendritic area (inter-soma distance 30–100 µm) were selected for paired recording with DSGCs. Evoked IPSCs onto DSGCs were isolated by holding DSGCs at 0 mV. For paired voltage-clamp recording between SACs and pDSGCs to mimic light-evoked activation of SACs, representative SAC holding potential waveforms that match the average number of noise events and the mean event amplitude were selected from current-clamp recordings of cKO SACs during the noisy bar visual stimulation. The somatic waveforms were scaled to best mimic the membrane depolarization patterns at SACs’ distal dendritic tip during visual stimulation (see Results). Only recordings with series resistances &lt; 20 MΩ, and ratio of membrane resistance to series resistance &gt;10 were included. For each SAC-DSGC pair, the peak DSGC IPSC amplitudes evoked by the control SAC Vm waveform in time window one is averaged across trials. This averaged ‘control waveform’ value is then used as a normalization factor for the averaged peak DSGC IPSC amplitude evoked by the ‘cKO’ SAC Vm waveform of the same SAC-DSGC pair in time window one across trials. The same normalization method is used for DSGC IPSC peak amplitudes in time window 3. Therefore, for each pair, time window one serves as an internal control for stable recording while time window three reveals the effect of SAC surround suppression on the short-term depression of SAC GABA release.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Grouped data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> were presented in boxplot, with the central mark indicates the median and the lower and upper edges of the box indicates 25% and 75% of the data, respectively.

rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a–2c</xref>, DSGC spiking onset is delayed with noisy background compared to that with noise-free background, which is consistent with diminished contribution of cholinergic inputs from laterally connected SACs. The excitatory inputs to DSGCs come from two sources: bipolar cells and SACs. The cholinergic inputs from the SAC account for the majority of the early phase DSGC excitation because of the large dendritic span (~220 um) of the SAC that forms lateral connections with the DSGC, while the more local bipolar cell-mediated glutamatergic excitation has a delayed onset compared to the cholinergic excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sethuramanujam et al., 2016</xref>). The contribution of cholinergic inputs to the onset of DSGC spiking has been shown by pharmacological blockade of nicotinic receptors, which results in a delayed onset of DSGC spiking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sethuramanujam et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Second, based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2d–2e</xref>, in noise-free background, motion-evoked DSGC EPSC amplitude is significantly reduced by the addition of the cholinergic receptor antagonist DHβE, indicating that both cholinergic and glutamatergic inputs contributed to DSGC EPSCs during motion in noise-free background. In contrast, DHβE did not cause significant reduction of EPSCs during motion in the noisy background, indicating that cholinergic contribution was not significant under this stimulus condition. Therefore, in contrast to the noise-free background, when the moving bar is against the flickering checkboard used in our study, bipolar cell-mediated glutamatergic inputs dominate DSGC excitation over SAC-mediated cholinergic inputs. Consistent with the predominant contribution of glutamatergic excitation to DSGCs under the noisy background condition, we did not detect a significant difference of DSGC EPSCs between the control and the <italic>Gabra2</italic> cKO groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></boxed-text></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62618.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>King</surname><given-names>Andrew J</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>University of Oxford</institution><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Preserving inhibition with a disinhibitory microcircuit in the retina&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

In this instance, we hope that you will be able to carry out the additional work outlined below in order to bolster the very interesting conclusions of this study.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Certain retinal ganglion cells are selective for the direction of motion of visual stimuli, and maintain this selectivity in the presence of a noisy background. Building on previous results, in this paper the authors find the mechanism responsible for this resilience to noise in the stimulus. They show that direction selectivity is preserved thanks to a disinhibitory circuit involving starburst amacrine cells, which leads to recovery from depression at the synapse with direction-selective ganglion cells so that their responses to coherent directional motion are enhanced. This is an insightful contribution, which provides an important mechanistic extension of the previous work and uncovers an interesting mode of operation of the widespread circuit motif of serial inhibition that could be present in other neural systems. It also highlights the challenges associated with maintaining stimulus feature selectivity when dealing with complex stimuli.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers were all enthusiastic about this paper, noting that the results are well supported by the experimental data. They identified certain areas where they felt that there are limitations in the study and made constructive suggestions for how these could be addressed in a timely fashion.</p><p>1) The dynamic clamp part is very elegant, but a limitation is that the relation between what happens at the level of the dendritic tip and what is recorded in the soma is complex, especially in starburst amacrine cells (SAC), due to the electrotonic isolation and the differences in selectivity of the different dendrites. When recording from the soma, one looks at an average contribution from the different dendrites, not specifically the ones that connect to the direction-selective ganglion cells of interest. The modelling work of the authors aims at solving this problem, but it is not clear if it really shows that, in such a noisy condition, the voltage in the dendrite will just be the one in the soma up to a scaling factor. Indeed, a major concern among the reviewers is that there is no direct experimental support for the model's prediction that the dendrites attenuate the somatic voltage-clamp signal by a factor of four (Figure 4). This prediction may be essential to interpreting the key experiment. One approach might be a calcium imaging control for voltage attenuation to compare calcium signals in the soma and dendrites in response to somatic depolarization, but that has its own caveats. Another would be simply to apply a range of scaling factors to the command waveform to show that the differences in depression are robust.</p><p>2) Figure 3 shows that recovery from synaptic depression takes several hundred milliseconds (at 400 ms, most of the paired-pulse suppression is still there), but faster motion stimuli allow only for 100 to 300 ms hyperpolarization (Figure 5D). Thus, one may expect that the suggested mechanism becomes less effective for higher stimulus speeds and that noise-induced suppression of the SAC output should by observed even with intact SAC-SAC inhibition. A more detailed consideration of the time that it takes for synaptic depression to recover is needed to help support the idea that this is indeed at the root of the observed phenomenon and may help understand the limits of the proposed circuit motif.

We agree with the reviewers that the accurate voltage at the dendritic tip is difficult to measure experimentally and we used modeling to estimate the dendritic voltage from our best effort. We followed the reviewers’ suggestion to apply additional scaling factors of 3 and 5 to the command waveforms. We observed similar effects: synaptic depression induced by knockout waveforms was robust with these scaling factors. We have included these results in the revised Figure 5 and the Results section.</p><p>In addition, we also compared DSGC IPSCs obtained from voltage-clamping SACs using 4x scaled waveforms with the IPSCs evoked by the actual noisy bar visual stimulation. We quantified the IPSC amplitude and charge transfer, and found that these values in paired recordings are in the lower end of the range for DSGC IPSCs evoked by the noisy bar stimulus (charge transfer: light-evoked: preferred direction: 95.1+/-8.6 pA*s; null direction, 198.6 +/- 22.5 pA*s, 16 cells; paired recordings: 100+ 12.1 pA*s, 22 cells; amplitude: light-evoked: preferred direction: 284.2 +/- 23.2 pA; null direction, 570.3 +/- 52.7 pA; paired recordings: 174.5 +/- 17.9 pA). Considering that more than one SAC form inhibitory synapses onto the DSGC, these values lend support that the measured DSGC inhibitory currents in the paired recordings are within the physiological range. We include these data in the revised Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 3 shows that recovery from synaptic depression takes several hundred milliseconds (at 400 ms, most of the paired-pulse suppression is still there), but faster motion stimuli allow only for 100 to 300 ms hyperpolarization (Figure 5D).

We have included additional experimental results and discussion to provide a more detailed consideration of the relationship of the surround suppression time window and synaptic depression. We interpret our experimental results below and in the revised manuscript.</p><p>In this study, we found that the SAC-SAC-DSGC disinhibitory motif prevents noise-induced synaptic depression. The SAC surround suppression provides a “protective” or “quiet” window to prevent noise-evoked SAC activation and consequent depression from occurring immediately before motion-evoked activation and neurotransmitter release. Noise-triggered SAC activations that occur within the surround suppression time window could engage unwanted depression for the subsequent motion response, because the SAC-DSGC synapse is prone to depression in the sub-second time scale (estimated from the paired pulse experiment in Figure 3). In <italic>Gabra2</italic> cKO mice, this vulnerable time window is no longer kept “quiet” but can be contaminated by noise-evoked SAC activation, leading to unwanted synaptic depression of the SAC-DSGC synapse that we observed during the noisy bar stimulus. In contrast, in WT mice, the SAC-SACDSGC motif actively suppresses the noise response during the time when the moving bar travels across the SAC RF surround. This function does not require that the SAC-DSGC synapse be chronically depressed by the baseline noise before the onset of motion-evoked surround suppression. Therefore, this function does not critically depend on the recovery from existing depression during the surround suppression window.</p><p>The reviewers pointed out that at higher speeds, the surround suppression window could be too short to separate the noise response from the motion response, so that synaptic depression occurs even with intact SAC-SAC inhibition in WT mice. We agree with the reviewers on this point, and reasoned that the more depressed motion-evoked release of <italic>Gabra2</italic> cKO SACs is not only due to less recovery from synaptic depression, but is likely also due to further depression by the extra noise activity within the surround suppression window. When we selected <italic>Gabra2</italic> cKO SAC voltage traces at the higher speed that contained the “unwanted” noise activation within the shorter surround suppression window as command waveforms in paired recordings (Figure 5G, lower panel), we observed more severe synaptic depression of the SAC-DSGC synapse than with the control waveform. Therefore, the SAC-SAC inhibition is still effective in shielding the SAC from further depression by the noise activity within the ~150 ms window prior to the motion response. The persistence of the protective role of SAC-SAC inhibition at the higher speed suggests that the short period immediately before the motion response plays an important role in shaping the motion-evoked SAC transmitter release.</p><p>The reviewers also raised the question on the selected voltage traces versus the ensemble of voltage traces. We have now included additional analysis of noise-driven activation during the surround suppression window at different speeds in WT and cKO groups, and show that noise suppression is less effective in cKO mice at all speeds (new Figure 5—figure supplement 1). For each speed, we selected SAC command waveforms that matched the average number of noise events and the mean event amplitude of each condition.</p><p>We have now added the above results and discussion in the revised manuscript (Results section; Discussion section). Together, these results establish the role of the SAC-SAC-DSGC motif in preventing unwanted noise-induced activity and synaptic depression of SACs during the surround suppression time window.</p></body></sub-article></article>
