to respond to previously experienced signals more robustly. However, whether and how the key proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α mediates transcriptional memory are poorly understood. Using HEK293F cells as a model system, we report that sustained TNF-α stimulation induces transcriptional memory dependent on TET enzymes. The hypomethylated status of transcriptional regulatory regions can be inherited, facilitating NF-κB binding and more robust subsequent activation. A high initial methylation level and CpG density around κB sites are correlated with the functional potential of transcriptional memory modules. Interestingly, the <italic>CALCB</italic> gene, encoding the proven migraine therapeutic target CGRP, exhibits the best transcriptional memory. A neighboring primate-specific endogenous retrovirus stimulates more rapid, more strong, and at least 100-fold more sensitive <italic>CALCB</italic> induction in subsequent TNF-α stimulation. Our study reveals that TNF-α-mediated transcriptional memory is governed by active DNA demethylation and greatly sensitizes memory genes to much lower doses of inflammatory cues.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Genes are the instruction manuals of life and contain the information needed to build the building blocks that keep cells alive. To read these instructions, cells use specific signals that activate genes. The process, known as gene expression, is tightly controlled and for the most part, fairly stable. But gene expression can be modified in various ways.</p><p>Epigenetics is a broad term for describing reversible changes made to genes to switch them on and off. Sometimes, certain genes even develop a kind of ‘transcriptional memory’ where over time, their expression is enhanced and speeds up with repeated activation signals. But this may also have harmful effects.</p><p>For example, the signalling molecule called tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α) is an essential part of the immune system. But it is also implicated in chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. In these conditions, cell signalling pathways triggering inflammation are overactive. One possibility is that TNF-α could be inducing the transcriptional memory of certain genes, amplifying their expression. But little is known about which fraction of genes exhibits transcriptional memory, and what differentiates memory genes from genes with stable expression.</p><p>Here, Zhao et al. treated cells grown in the laboratory with TNF-α to investigate its role in transcriptional memory and find out what epigenetic features might govern the process. The experiments showed that mimicking a sustained inflammation by stimulating TNF-α, triggered a transcriptional memory in some genes, and enabled them to respond to much lower levels of TNF-α on subsequent exposure.</p><p>Zhao et al. also discovered that genes tagged with methyl groups are more likely to show transcriptional memory when stimulated by TNF-α. However, they also found that these groups must be removed to consolidate any transcriptional memory.</p><p>This work shows how TNF-α influences can alter the expression of certain genes. It also suggests that transcriptional memory, stimulated by TNF-α, may be a possible mechanism underlying chronic inflammatory conditions. This could help future research in identifying more genes with transcriptional memory.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transcriptional

features: signal-induced plasticity and relatively stable mitotic inheritance. Signal-induced epigenetic plasticity allows changes in gene expression profiles and cell fate switching, whereas mitotic inheritance ensures the maintenance of gene expression profiles and cell fate. In theory, the combinatory effect of signal-induced plasticity and mitotic inheritance should convey epigenetic transcriptional memory, which allows certain genes to respond to previously experienced signals more robustly with faster kinetics and greater magnitude.</p><p>The first examples of transcriptional memory date back to almost half a century ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergink et al., 1973</xref>). Current understanding of transcriptional memory events and underlying mechanisms has been nicely reviewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">D'Urso and Brickner, 2014</xref>). In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the <italic>INO1</italic> and <italic>GAL</italic> genes are the best studied examples of transcriptional memory genes. These genes can remember past inositol or galactose induction and exhibit accelerated induction kinetics during a second induction, and this transcriptional memory can last for a few cell divisions. These transcriptional memory events depend on a number of mechanisms, including gene looping, nuclear pore targeting, histone H2A.Z deposition, and H3K4 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bheda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">D'Urso et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kundu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Light et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tan-Wong et al., 2009</xref>). In mammals, interferon-induced transcriptional memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gialitakis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kamada et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Light et al., 2013</xref>) and inflammation-induced <italic>Aim2</italic> gene transcriptional memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Naik et al., 2017</xref>) also rely on chromatin structure and histone modifications. On the other hand, DNA demethylation has been observed to associate with transcriptional memory of the <italic>Tat</italic> gene during glucocorticoid induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Thomassin et al., 2001</xref>) and the <italic>IL2</italic> gene during T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Murayama et al., 2006</xref>), but whether DNA demethylation plays a causal role in transcriptional memory regulation remains unclear. In summary, transcriptional memory enhances the future response to a previously experienced stimulus, providing a mechanism for cells to adapt to environmental changes.</p><p>Several critical and intriguing questions regarding transcriptional memory need to be explored. Why do only a small fraction of genes induced by the same stimuli exhibit transcriptional memory? What differentiates genes with or without transcriptional memory effects? What are the characteristics of epigenetic modules governing transcriptional memory?</p><p>The proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reimold, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schett et al., 2013</xref>). TNF-α activates the transcription factor NF-κB, which is essential for inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duh et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lowenthal et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Osborn et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Taniguchi and Karin, 2018</xref>). Canonical NF-κB contains p65 and p50 and binds to genomic regions termed κB sites to activate target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hayden and Ghosh, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sen and Baltimore, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). We previously reported that short-term TNF-α treatment activates the methylated <italic>IL32</italic> gene in the absence of demethylation and that long-term TNF-α treatment induces DNA demethylation of the <italic>IL32</italic> promoter and CpG island, which depends on p65 and TET enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). However, whether any NF-κB target gene exhibits transcriptional memory in response to TNF-α induction is unknown.</p><p>By combining reporter assays and genome-wide analysis, we found that the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α can induce transcriptional memory effects in several target genes. These genes are associated with p65 peaks induced by TNF-α treatment. Interestingly, these regions are heavily methylated in cells naïve to TNF-α signaling and tend to become demethylated in a p65 and TET enzyme-dependent manner during sustained TNF-α treatment. Although p65 can associate with its binding motif located within heavily methylated regions, the transcriptional activation capacity of p65 is potentiated by demethylation. This explains why a small fraction of p65 target genes display inflammatory transcriptional memory because NF-κB binding sites embedded within heavily methylated regions are more likely to serve as epigenetic memory modules. Our study reveals that the transcriptional memory established by sustained TNF-α stimulation is dependent on TET enzymes and significantly enhances the sensitivity to inflammatory signals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CMV promoter-driven reporter gene possesses inflammatory transcriptional memory</title><p>We previously generated HEK293F-derived cells containing an integrated <italic>EGFP</italic> reporter gene under the control of a fully methylated CMV (cytomegalovirus) promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), with which we performed a number of screens to identify factors and compounds regulating DNA methylation or methylation-mediated gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Du et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2018b</xref>).

With the above features in mind, to identify endogenous genes with inflammatory transcriptional memory, we performed RNA-seq experiments with the following samples: no induction, 12 hr TNF-α induction, 12-day TNF-α induction, 10-day recovery from a 12-day TNF-α induction, and second induction (12 days of TNF-α treatment followed by 10 days without TNF-α, then treated with TNF-α for 12 hr).</p><p>We defined TNF-α-responsive genes as those that displayed greater than twofold upregulation upon 12 hr of TNF-α treatment with statistical significance (p&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Among them, five endogenous genes together with the <italic>EGFP</italic> reporter were defined as inflammatory transcriptional memory genes, as they were expressed at least 1.3-fold higher in the second TNF-α induction than in the first TNF-α induction and exhibited an FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped fragments) value greater than 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The <italic>EGFP</italic> reporter and five endogenous memory genes can be categorized into two groups: <italic>EGFP, CALCB,</italic> and <italic>PTGES</italic> displayed excellent memory effects, whereas the memory effects of <italic>CCL2, TNF,</italic> and <italic>LHX2</italic> were relatively moderate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Indeed, <italic>EGFP, CALCB,</italic> and <italic>PTGES</italic> also displayed apparently elevated baseline expression in the absence of TNF-α signal after the initial induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). <italic>IL32</italic> was upregulated in cells with 12-day TNF-α pretreatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>), but <italic>IL32</italic> did not exhibit a stronger second induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Among the five endogenous genes displaying inflammatory transcriptional memory, <italic>CALCB</italic> was of particular interest for two reasons. First, <italic>CALCB</italic> clearly exhibited the best memory effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Second, <italic>CALCB</italic> encodes β-CGRP. β-CGRP, and α-CGRP (encoded by <italic>CALCA</italic>) are two isoforms of CGRP (<italic>c</italic>alcitonin <italic><underline>g</underline></italic>ene-<italic>r</italic>elated <italic>p</italic>eptide). They are 37-amino acid–secreted neuropeptides and differ by three amino acids in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Russell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Russo, 2015</xref>). The two CGRP isoforms share similar biological activities and are potent vasodilators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brain et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Russell et al., 2014</xref>). The overexpression of CGRP is an important cause of migraine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Edvinsson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ho et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pellesi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Russell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Russo, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tepper, 2018</xref>), and several monoclonal antibodies (eptinezumab, fremanezumab, galcanezumab, and erenumab) against CGRP or CGRP receptors have been approved by the FDA as therapeutics for migraine patients.

Therefore, it is highly important to determine the characteristic features of the inflammatory transcriptional memory modules associated with these five genes. The p65 peaks were linked to the nearest genes that are located within a 100 kb distance, and in total, 10 TNF-α-induced p65 peaks were associated with these genes. These peaks displayed several consistent features: they were highly methylated in cells naïve to TNF-α and exhibited obvious demethylation during memory consolidation, their demethylation was impaired upon the loss of <italic>RELA</italic> and <italic>TET2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), and they exhibited greater H3K27ac enrichment during the second TNF-α induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These results imply that although TNF-α-induced p65 chromatin association can occur without DNA demethylation, the p65 chromatin association is favored in regions with less methylation. Indeed, when we grouped p65 peaks according to their initial DNA methylation levels and then plotted p65 occupancy in cells treated with the first dose of TNF-α for 12 hr, it was obvious that p65 could bind methylated regions but favored unmethylated regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Thus, one important mechanism in consolidating inflammatory transcriptional memory is to change initially disfavored methylated p65-binding regions into favored unmethylated regions, to facilitate p65 binding and to achieve more effective transcriptional activation when a subsequent stimulus arrives.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>High initial methylation level and CpG density determine the functional potential of transcriptional memory modules in response to TNF-α stimulation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Methylation levels of ten p65 peaks that are associated with the five memory genes.

Why?</p><p>To address this critical question, we carefully compared p65 peaks in the <italic>IL32</italic> promoter and other transcriptional memory genes, and we noticed that the adjacent region of the κB site in the <italic>IL32</italic> promoter had fewer CpGs than the other p65 peaks associated with genes displaying a memory effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), whereas the three genes (<italic>EGFP, CALCB,</italic> and <italic>PTGES</italic>) with the best memory effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) contained more CpGs in their associated p65 peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). To test the effect of the number of CpGs, we chose highly methylated p65 peaks (methylation level ≥50%), grouped them according to the CpG number within 250 bp flanking the κB sites, and then plotted p65 occupancy in cells treated with the first dose of TNF-α for 12 hr. Indeed, p65 occupancy was higher in regions with fewer CpGs even though the methylation levels were equally high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>The above results suggest that the total DNA methylation (combining CpG number and methylation level) in the adjacent regions of κB sites is critical for their potential to serve as epigenetic modules for inflammatory transcriptional memory. Indeed, when we grouped p65 peaks according to their total methylation level and plotted p65 occupancy in cells treated with the first dose of TNF-α for 12 hr, regions with higher total methylation were clearly more disfavored for p65 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). In retrospect, this is easy to understand because the efficiency of methylation-mediated repression depends not only on the methylation level but also on the regional methylated CpG density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Curradi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hsieh, 1994</xref>).</p><p>We systematically analyzed the occupancy of p65 between the two TNF-α induction times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) and observed that occupancy-increased peaks were prone to high initial methylation and became demethylated after 12 days of TNF-α treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). We also compared p65 occupancy, ATAC-seq signal, and H3K27ac signal according to various levels of total methylated CpGs, and the reduction in the number of methylated CpGs promoted p65 binding, chromatin opening, and H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H–J</xref>).</p><p>The above results suggest that initially methylated p65 peaks with the largest amount of total demethylation may function as potential inflammatory transcriptional memory modules. To functionally assess this hypothesis, we chose 515 methylated p65 peaks (methylation level ≥50%) out of 1143 p65 peaks and divided them into two groups: the highly demethylated p65 peaks comprising the top 25% of total demethylation during 12-day TNF-α treatment (129 peaks associated with 106 genes, including all five memory genes) and the other methylated p65 peaks (386 peaks associated with 295 genes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>). Then, we analyzed these peaks and their associated genes.</p><p>First, upon second induction, the genes of the highly demethylated group displayed higher expression of their own enhancer RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>). This suggests that these p65 peak regions possess the potential ability to serve as inflammatory epigenetic memory modules. Moreover, neighboring genes associated with the highly demethylated p65 peaks also exhibited higher expression during the second induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M</xref>). In addition, the impact on neighboring genes was distance-sensitive, and genes with transcriptional start sites (TSSs) within 10 kb of the highly demethylated p65 peaks exhibited stronger transcriptional memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6N</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, p65 peaks with high initial methylation and CpG density are more likely to serve as inflammatory transcriptional memory modules.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Memory consolidation elevates TNF-α sensitivity by more than 100-fold</title><p>Transcriptional memory has been shown to allow cells to respond to previously exposed stimuli more rapidly and more strongly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergink et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">D'Urso and Brickner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">D'Urso et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gialitakis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kamada et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Light et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Light et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Murayama et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Naik et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tan-Wong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Thomassin et al., 2001</xref>).

Therefore, we treated naïve cells and cells that had experienced a 12-day initial TNF-α treatment with various concentrations of TNF-α (0.4 ng/mL, 2 ng/mL, 10 ng/mL, and 50 ng/mL) for 12 hr. Both cells displayed dose-dependent activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Amazingly, cells that had experienced prior TNF-α treatment could achieve an approximately twofold better effect with a 125-fold lower TNF-α concentration (0.4 ng/mL) than naïve cells treated with 50 ng/mL TNF-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

From the epigenetics perspective, DNA demethylation appears to contribute to transcriptional memory events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Murayama et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Thomassin et al., 2001</xref>), but the causal role of DNA demethylation in governing transcriptional memory has yet to be demonstrated. This study clearly demonstrated that TET enzymes are essential in governing transcriptional memory in response to TNF-α, providing a causal role for active DNA demethylation in consolidating transcriptional memory. From the inflammation perspective, a long-term puzzle is why acute inflammation can sometimes be transformed into chronic inflammation when the initial inflammatory signal is greatly reduced. Our discovery that sustained inflammatory signals can lead to the formation of transcriptional memory and that certain genes under the control of inflammatory transcriptional memory can even increase their sensitivity to inflammatory signals by 100-fold may provide some answers to this long-standing question.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Systematic identification of transcriptional memory genes</title><p>Transcriptional memory has been studied for several decades, but the number of transcriptional memory genes remains relatively small. More examples need to be identified to reveal the significance of transcriptional memory. Two key difficulties exist in the identification of genes with transcriptional memory. First, they consist of only a small fraction of targeting genes responding to a particular signal of interest. Second, the duration of initial signal treatment can impact the process of memory consolidation. This study offers a pipeline to systematically identify genes with transcriptional memory by combining a defined signaling cue, a time course of the initial stimulus for memory consolidation, a dedicated transcriptome comparative analysis, and a functional validation with key regulator mutated cells. With this pipeline, we believe that many new transcriptional memory genes in response to various signaling cues will be quickly identified, which will certainly boost our understanding of the functional roles of transcriptional memory in many systems, such as the potential roles of transcriptional memory in immune cell memory.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Signal-induced active DNA demethylation is likely a general principle for transcriptional memory</title><p>It is well known that transcription factor associations promote local demethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brandeis et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Costa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de la Rica et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dubois-Chevalier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fujiki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kirillov et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Macleod et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Perera et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rampal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sérandour et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Silke et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tsai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xiong et al., 2016</xref>), and many transcription factors respond to various signaling cues. Our finding of inflammatory signal-induced DNA demethylation and its role in transcriptional memory consolidation is unlikely to be unique to inflammation signaling. We expect this to be an applicable principle for many other types of long-term transcriptional memory.</p><p>In theory, long-term transcriptional memory should be governed by epigenetic mechanisms that can be maintained for a long time in quiescent cells and can be faithfully inherited for many cell divisions in proliferating cells. DNA methylation is likely the best candidate because it meets both criteria. Importantly, CpG methylation tends to display a bimodal distribution (all or none) within a region, and this kind of digital behavior makes it an ideal candidate to store digital information at regulatory regions with a simple status code such as ‘naïve/methylated/locked’ and ‘memory consolidated/unmethylated/unlocked’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Whether this bimodal switch mediated by signal-induced demethylation also governs other types of transcriptional memory events is a highly interesting topic for future investigation and is relatively straightforward to test.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>High CpG density and initial methylation levels around the κB sites correlate with the functional potential to serve as inflammatory transcriptional memory modules</title><p>The methyl-CpG binding proteins are important for DNA methylation-mediated transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bird and Wolffe, 1999</xref>). Moreover, the number and density of methylated cytosines are crucial for the efficiency of gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Curradi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hsieh, 1994</xref>).</p><p>In this study, high CpG density and initial methylation level around the κB sites were found to positively correlate with the functional potential of these regions to serve as inflammatory transcriptional memory modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H–J</xref>), likely because DNA methylation is more effective in establishing a repressive environment in these regions, and sustained TNF-α induction is required to demethylate these regions to consolidate transcriptional memory.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Methylation-insensitive TFs can be methylation-sensitive in the chromatin context and participate in transcriptional memory regulation</title><p>DNA methylation has a long-established role in gene silencing, but it is also known that gene activation can occur without demethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amedeo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2018a</xref>). Some TFs contain CpG site(s) within their binding motifs and are sensitive to CpG methylation. Some TFs can bind and even favor binding motifs containing methylated CpG site(s). Therefore, TFs are classified as methylation-sensitive and methylation-insensitive TFs, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tate and Bird, 1993</xref>). Some other TFs, including NF-κB, are also methylation-insensitive when their binding motifs do not contain any CpGs. Indeed, p65 can activate methylated target genes without prior demethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D</xref>). Therefore, the question is why transcriptional memory genes governed by a methylation-insensitive TF (NF-κB in this case) exhibit great expression differences in response to the same signal stimulus before and after DNA demethylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref>).</p><p>We believe that two explanations likely exist, and they may function independently or in combination to regulate transcriptional memory. First, as we presented, p65 exhibits marked preference toward the target sequence within unmethylated regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), and demethylation lowers the transcriptional induction threshold and leads to higher gene induction with a 100-fold lower stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Second, methylation-insensitive, signal-dependent TFs may function together with methylation-sensitive TFs to regulate transcriptional memory events. In this context, DNA demethylation induced by the signal-dependent, methylation-insensitive TFs may facilitate the binding of other methylation-sensitive TFs and activate gene transcription in a coordinated manner.</p><p>The terms methylation-sensitive and methylation-insensitive TFs were originally defined by their interactions with naked DNA. We would like to emphasize that in the context of chromatin, even traditional methylation-insensitive TFs that contain no CpGs in their binding motifs greatly favor their binding sites embedded in unmethylated regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Binding is not functioning</title><p>κB sites embedded in regions with higher CpG density and initial methylation levels tended to display functional potential to serve as inflammatory transcriptional modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H–J</xref>); however, only a small fraction of these modules could actually drive the transcriptional memory events of adjacent genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6N</xref>). One possible explanation is that not all κB sites bound by p65 can drive the expression of neighboring genes. This again emphasizes the point that binding is not functioning, and transcriptional factor binding can only stimulate gene expression when enhancer-promoter connection is functionally wired.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Migraine patients may suffer from the inflammatory transcriptional memory of <italic>CALCB</italic></title><p>Migraine is a recurrent unilateral headache disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pellesi et al., 2017</xref>), and it is one of the five leading causes of YLDs (<italic>y</italic>ears <italic>l</italic>ived with <italic>d</italic>isability) in the world, contributing to more than 30 million YLDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">GBD 2016 Disease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence Collaborators, 2017</xref>).

signal induced transcriptional memory, which is dependent on signal induced transcription factor activation and active DNA demethylation. Such transcriptional memory offers more rapid, more strong and more sensitive subsequent signal response. And this is likely a general principle that can be applied to other signaling systems.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Sustained TNF-α stimulation induces transcriptional memory that provides 100-fold more sensitive subsequent induction&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Xiaobing Shi as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript explores the impact of DNA methylation on TNF-α-stimulated transcriptional memory. Transcriptional memory is a phenomenon that leads to heritable increase in the transcriptional response of certain genes to a stimulus that has been experienced previously. Transcriptional memory has been studied in many systems and has been shown to require transcription factors, co-activators, histone variants, histone modifications and physical interaction with nuclear pore proteins. The authors find that a GFP reporter under the control of a methylated NFkB-responsive CMV promoter exhibits a distinct form of transcriptional memory; after 10 days following previous exposure to TNF-α, the reporter shows both higher basal expression and greater responsiveness to TNF-α. This effect increases as the length of the previous treatment increases. Furthermore, the DNA methylation of the CMV promoter decreased over 12 days of TNF-α treatment. This loss of methylation and the increase in expression requires TET2 and, to some extent, TET3. From this, the authors propose that recruitment of TET2 (and perhaps TET3) to the CMV promoter during the initial induction demethylates the promoter, removing a heritable repressive mark and enhancing its responsiveness to TNF-α in the future. RNAseq experiments identified a small number of genes that behave like the CMV reporter. They focused on CALCB, a neuropeptide that stimulates vasodilation and has been implicated in migrane. TNF-α activates CALCB through NFkB and the level of expression increased over the course of 8 days of TNF-α treatment. Inactivation of TET2 reduced the accumulation for CALCB between 9h and 12d and these cells did not show memory. The authors find that two p65 binding sites near CALCB become demethylated during TNF-α treatment and remain less methylated for weeks. They propose that this promotes better binding by p65, leading to greater responsiveness. Finally, based on analysis of 10 p65 peaks near five genes that exhibit memory, the authors propose that highly methylated p65 binding sites with greater number of CpGs nearby are most affected by long-term treatment with TNF-α.</p><p>Overall, this is a very interesting study reporting a novel mechanism of TNF-α induced inflammatory transcriptional memory mediated by DNA demethylation. The involvement of DNA methylation in heritable changes in transcriptional regulation in response to environmental signals is of broad interest. The data is of high quality and generally supports the conclusions. However, there are a few concerns that need to be experimentally addressed to strengthen the paper.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>1) The alternative mechanism to genomic/chromatin-based memory is that the physiological state of the cells or the activation status of the signaling pathways is different at the times of the first and second inductions. These possibilities need to be thoroughly tested.</p><p>2) It is possible that the loss of DNA methylation is due to non-specific effects of transcription on DNA methylation rather than specific demethylation. To distinguish between these possibilities, it is important to determine whether there is a direct protein-protein interaction between p65 and TET2, whether TET2 is recruited to p65 binding sites and if so, whether TET2 recruitment is dependent on p65.</p><p>3) The authors observed that TET deficient cells showed loss of transcription memory. Whether this loss of transcriptional memory is purely dependent on DNA methylation or requires p65 is not clear. P65 ChIP-seq or ChIP-qPCR at CALCB loci and / or CMV promoter in WT and TET-TKO cells will help to address this point.</p><p>4) Knock down TET2 after previously treating with TNF-α but before retreatment. If this disrupts memory (and leads to increased DNA methylation), it would argue that TET2-mediated demethylation is continuously important for proper inheritance. If it does not disrupt memory, it would argue that TET2-mediated demethylation occurs during the primary TNF-α treatment and that the low DNA methylation state is heritable afterward.</p><p>5) The expression of TET proteins and the 5hmC level are quite low in HEK293 cells. It is important to examine the endogenous TET protein and 5hmC levels in HEK293F cells used in this study during TNF-a stimulation. It would greatly strengthen the paper if the authors could validate the findings observed in this study in another system with relatively high TET expression, such as T cells, in which the epigenetic memory is important for cytokine production.</p><p>6) Does the memory feature apply to more genes than the few being examined in this study? The data suggesting a change in p65 occupancy or H3K27ac is primarily observed through averaging many sites and is less convincing for the sites that were studied functionally. The occupancy of p65 from the ChIP-seq experiments should be quantified and unbiased, statistical methods should be used to identify genes, in addition to the few being examined in this study, that have changed between the primary and secondary TNF-α treatment. Actually, for all the omics studies (RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, methyl-seq), it would be necessary to perform unbiased global analysis and provide the lists of differentially expressed gene (DEG), methylated sites, or enriched regions as part of QC. It seems that basic data QC information is missing in the supplementary materials. For example, how many reads were collected for each sample, what is the bisulfite conversion efficiency of methyl-seq, and what is the percentage of reads within identified peaks? All are essential for determining the qualify and rigor of these datasets.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61965.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>1) The alternative mechanism to genomic/chromatin-based memory is that the physiological state of the cells or the activation status of the signaling pathways is different at the times of the first and second inductions.

Based on the expression profiles, we believe that the general physiological state of the cells has not been changed after memory consolidation, except that a few memory genes become ready for a robust 2<sup>nd</sup> induction. These results have been added as new Figure 2—figure supplement 1C.

In certain examples, these transcription factors are reported to interact with the TET enzymes (6-11,13); While in some other cases, no direct evidence supporting the interaction between transcription factors and TET enzymes was provided (5,14). We expressed Flag-TET1, Flag-TET2, or Flag-TET3 in HEK293F cells and treated cells with 12 h TNF-α stimulation. Then we performed CoIP experiments between p65 and the TET enzymes, but we did not observe any convincing interactions even under low stringency washing conditions (150 mM NaCl) (data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). Therefore, we believe the TET enzymes do not directly interact with p65, although their demethylation functions are clearly dependent on p65 (Figure 4D).</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-61965-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>On the other hand, increased chromatin accessibility has been reported to facilitate DNA demethylation mediated by the TET enzymes (15-18). To measure chromatin accessibility at p65 binding sites, we performed ATAC-seq experiments with cells under different treatments. Apparently, TNF-α treatment robustly increased local chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>). Taken together, we prefer a model that TET2-mediated demethylation is dependent on p65-induced chromatin environment changes but not direct protein-protein interaction between p65 and TET2.</p><fig id="sa2fig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-61965-resp-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><p>To differentiate the contributions of p65 binding and p65-dependent transcriptional activation in TNF-α-induced demethylation, we determined p65 binding peaks in TNF-α-treated cells and selected those were heavily methylated in naïve cells, and then categorized them into three groups based on their eRNA expression levels. Interestingly, regardless whether eRNA can be detected from these p65 binding peaks, demethylation occurred in a similar way (new Figure 4H). Therefore, we conclude that p65 binding <italic>per se</italic>, but not active transcription is the main cause of TNF-α-induced demethylation.

First, inducible <italic>TET2</italic> knockout is a complicated strategy that requires a substantial amount of time to perform and will delay the publication. Moreover, DNA methylation maintenance is very robust and DNA methylation pattern is highly stable in most somatic cells. We have shown that in the absence of TNF-α treatment (no p65 binding and p65-dependent TET2 function) for 30 days, which equals approximately 30 cell divisions, <italic>CALCB</italic> transcriptional memory remained unchanged (Figure 2F) and <italic>CALCB</italic> enhancers remained unmethylated (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D).

To us, p65 occupancy, or ATAC-seq signal or K27ac signal are good indications that these regions have the functional potential to be enhancers. However, enhancer-promoter wiring is another critical issue to make these potentially functioning units into real functioning units. This process involves many other factors and that is why only a fraction of these potential enhancers can truly activate genes. But based on the eRNA expression, these potential enhancers are already idling. They just do not have the opportunity to be connected with a promoter in this particular cell type.
