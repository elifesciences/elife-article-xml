We have compared these articles, and reader engagement with them, to other articles on Wikipedia. We found that WPM articles are longer, possess a greater density of external links, and are visited more often than other articles on Wikipedia. Readers of WPM articles are more likely to hover over and view footnotes than other readers, but are less likely to visit the hyperlinked sources in these footnotes. Our findings suggest that WPM readers appear to use links to external sources to verify and authorize Wikipedia content, rather than to examine the sources themselves.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Wikipedia</kwd><kwd>meta-research</kwd><kwd>scholarly communication</kwd><kwd>bibliometrics</kwd><kwd>medicine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Readers of health and medicine Wikipedia pages are more likely to hover over and view footnotes than other readers, but less likely to view the hyperlinked sources in these footnotes.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Template</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Wikipedia is a freely available online encyclopedia that intends to provide “every single person on the planet free access to the sum of all human knowledge” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Wikimedia Foundation, 2004</xref>). To meet this mission, thousands of volunteer editors have created almost six million English-language Wikipedia pages. Many of these pages include hyperlinked footnotes to the sources used to assemble and verify the content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Redi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wikipedia Foundation, 2019a</xref>). These linked references do not only serve as sources of authority for Wikipedia content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fallis, 2008</xref>), but also offer readers a gateway to further learning, with this opportunity enhanced by the growing degree of public access to research literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Piwowar et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Wikipedia is proving to be a leading source of health information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Heilman and West, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Laurent and Vickers, 2009</xref>), and reader engagement with a page’s references can provide opportunities to understand a diagnosis or inform a conversation with their physician. Wikipedia’s health-focused pages, which are maintained by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Medicine">WikiProject Medicine</ext-link> (WPM) editors, are thought to meet a high standard of quality and rigor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">James, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Maskalyk, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Trevena, 2011</xref>). For example, WPM provides a series of resources for its editors, including “guidelines and policies” for reliable sources, and advice on how to avoid conflicts of interest. In its advice for reliable sources, WPM recommends using “review articles (especially systematic reviews) published in reputable medical journals” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wikipedia Foundation, 2019b</xref>). Wikipedia then provides tools to standardize the bibliographic representation and linking to external sources.</p><p>These external sources are particularly relevant for students and practitioners in medicine and other health-related professions, who are active Wikipedia readers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Rössler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Scaffidi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Back et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Egle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allahwala et al., 2013</xref>). These readers are familiar with the research literature, and expected to engage in evidence-based medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Guyatt et al., 2015</xref>). To this end, faculty at several health professions schools, such as schools of medicine and pharmacy, teach courses on editing Wikipedia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azzam et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Joshi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apollonio et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In a previous study, we investigated Wikipedia as a gateway to further reading through external links by tracking referrals from Wikipedia to research article DOIs (Digital Object Identifier) through Crossref, combined with pageview information from Wikimedia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Maggio et al., 2017</xref>). However, with the data available at the time, we could not determine if a click to an external reference with a DOI originated from a WPM page.</p><p>To learn more about reader engagement with Wikipedia’s external references, this study leverages Wikimedia’s newly created infrastructure for data collection to compare engagement with external links by readers of WPM pages with that of readers of the rest of Wikipedia.

The data remained within that system, as required by WMF, for a year before being deleted (see Acknowledgements). We anonymized the aggregated data by removing IP addresses, any identifying browser information, and reader-sessions associated with page edits. While this data is not publicly available, data may be available upon request from the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Research/Research_and_Data">WMF research team</ext-link>.

Wikipedia pages or topics were identified as being part of two main groups: WikiProject Medicine pages (WPM) and the rest of Wikipedia (W). To be included in the study, the pages from each group had to have at least one external link in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Externallinks_table">externallinks</ext-link> table. The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Categorylinks_table">categorylinks</ext-link> table was used to define the WPM pages, with each possessing a Talk page bearing the category “All WikiProject Medicine articles.” Both the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Externallinks_table">externallinks</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Categorylinks_table">categorylinks</ext-link> tables were queried twice (April 1<sup>st</sup>, 2019 and April 20<sup>th</sup>, 2019) during a 32 day study period (March 22<sup>nd </sup>– April 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2019).</p><p>For determining the number of pages, length of pages, the number of external links, and the number of “freely accessible” links added by editors as sources, a single day’s worth of database and XML dump files were captured from late in the study period (April 20<sup>th,</sup> 2019). As the database and XML dump files had only 0.5% more external links than on April 1<sup>st</sup>, 2019, the sample from April 20<sup>th</sup> was felt to be sufficiently representative to serve as the source for all static data counts. The external link count, which is based on MediaWiki’s <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Externallinks_table">externallinks</ext-link> table, does not include <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Links#Interwiki_links">interwiki links</ext-link>, representing abbreviated forms of commonly-used internal and external links, which limits the accuracy of external link counts for both WPM and W. The event logging system this study relied on similarly omitted data from interwiki links, meaning the definition of an external link used across this study is consistent.</p><p>Pageview data was gathered from the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/Data_Lake/Traffic/Pageview_hourly">wmf.pageview_hourly</ext-link> table. WMF employs methods to identify bot traffic in pageview data, which was excluded in our analysis. In reporting the data collected over a 32 day period (March 22<sup>nd </sup>– April 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2019), the raw counts were divided by 32 to create a count approximating a “daily average” for these counts, in light of this serving as a common measure of internet traffic.</p><p>Reader engagement with external links was gathered from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:EventLogging">Wikimedia’s Event Logging system</ext-link> using the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Schema:CitationUsage">CitationUsage schema</ext-link>, instrumented by Wikimedia’s programmers, following a month of piloting and refinement for this study. The CitationUsage schema collected all sessions with reader engagement, except for those involving anonymous Wikipedia editors (21 sessions out of 72,953,065 total, which translated into the removal of 34 citation events out of a total of 113,520,376). For the entire study period (March 22<sup>nd </sup>– April 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2019), the CitationUsage schema captured the following types of engagement: (a) clicking an external link; (b) clicking on a reference link listed among a page’s set of references; (c) clicking a footnote link leading to a reference on the page; (d) hovering over a reference link (defined as a reader’s cursor lingering over a link for 1000 milliseconds or more, revealing a rollover label); (e) time from pageview to event (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Additionally, the CitationUsage schema captured the clicking of links bearing the “freely accessible” icon.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Types of engagement with external links</title><p>Different events captured by the CitationUsage Schema that reflect how readers of Wikipedia pages engage with external links.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Engagement type</th><th valign="top">General description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">External click</td><td valign="top">A click on a link located on a Wikipedia page leading to a web page outside of Wikipedia.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Hover</td><td valign="top">An event that occurs when a reader hovers over a link for at least 1000 milliseconds on a Wikipedia page.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Footnote click</td><td valign="top">A click of an internal footnote link – <sup>[1]</sup> – that takes the reader to the reference section at the bottom of the Wikipedia page.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Up click</td><td valign="top">A click of an arrow – <sup>^</sup> – that takes the reader from the reference at the bottom of the Wikipedia page back to the citation in the main text.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics were calculated using Excel (Redmond, WA).

For the third parameter (c), we compared the two groups over all possible combinations of access method and type of engagement with a two-tailed Fisher's exact test. To explore and visualize the data, we used respectively Spark/Pandas and the library Seaborn.

However, there was no evidence to suggest that links with these icons were clicked more frequently than other links.

Overall, readers of WPM pages were more likely (56.6 pageviews per event) to engage with a link than W readers (66.5 pageviews per event).

Yet, W readers more frequently clicked external links, with the difference especially notable when on their mobile device, where they were almost twice as likely to click an external link than WPM readers. This suggests that the external links in WPM may not be as mobile-friendly. The up click, in which a reader clicks the link from a footnote back (up) to the text, was not a function that appeared on the iOS and Android mobile devices we tested, as the footnote appears at the bottom of the screen when clicked and disappears on touching the text (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table5" position="float"><label>Table 5.</label><caption><title>Number of pageviews per engagement event.</title><p>The frequency of each event per day was divided by the average number of daily pageviews for WPM and W pages from March 22<sup>nd</sup> to April 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2019.

WPM readers are more likely to hover over references, causing them to appear in a window, and more likely to view the footnotes than other readers. But readers of WPM pages click on external links less often than readers of other parts of Wikipedia.</p><p>This behavior pattern suggests that readers are more interested in validating the external references. This interest may arise from readers who are relatively new to these pages and are in the process of reassuring themselves as to the scientific basis of the content they are consulting. But it may also arise from readers who are trained, or are in the process of being trained, in health professions where they are required to critically appraise and integrate health information into the care of their patients. These evidence-based practitioners are able to judge a lot about the quality of information from the bibliographic reference to the sources, which they view by hovering over or going to the footnote. In addition to being able to see at a glance (or a hover) whether the cited work is a review (which is recommend by Wikipedia as being the “ideal source”), readers are able to identify publication date, language, publication venue (i.e., journal name), and availability (via open access) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Example of information displayed when hovering over footnotes in Wikipedia.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) An external link on the Hepatitis page, revealed by “hovering” over the footnote number, indicating that the source is a systematic review conducted by the Cochrane Collaboration (with a green icon PMC link signaling open access to the source).

The greater attention that WPM readers are paying to citations could well be a function of their educational backgrounds, reflecting the demonstrated use of WPM by health professionals, students and practitioners. Although not the focus of this study, the educational value of internal links, in which terms on a WPM page are hyperlinked to other Wikipedia pages or to VideoWiki, should also be noted as a further strategy for maintaining the comprehensive informational and educational quality of WPM pages.</p><p>This still leaves the question of why WPM readers are less likely to click through to the external source than readers of the rest of Wikipedia. This question is particularly relevant given the interest demonstrated by WPM readers in viewing the citations (by hovering or clicking on footnote numbers), as well as by the studies (cited above) demonstrating that health professionals use WPM pages, which suggests a potential capacity for further learning through the external links. One possibility is that readers are deterred from clicking on external WPM links in light of our finding that only a fifth of the research cited in WPM pages are publicly accessible, with the rest placed by publishers behind a paywall for subscribers or credit card access. Earlier studies have found that it is common for readers, including physicians, who encounter a paywall to be reluctant to explore the literature further (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Moorhead et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Maggio et al., 2016</xref>). It is possible that if all the research literature was available through open access (and this fact was promoted among readers) health professionals may be more likely to pursue the greater educational advantage of the external links. Currently, there are very few links bearing an open access icon, and readers show no additional interest in viewing these links just because they are open. If readers start expecting that external links will be open (and there is some promotion of this fact), then the two studies just cited suggest that the chances of them pursuing an item of interest will become more likely.</p><p>Although this study does not provide a means of determining why readers hover rather than click on external links, this is something that could be addressed using smaller-scale research strategies like reader questionnaires or think-aloud protocols. Alternatively, design experiments, which experiment with external link format and context, could be conducted involving, (a) WPM pages in which all external links are clearly indicated as open access, (b) tested readers are given prior training in how to learn from cited works, and (c) how different mobile interfaces impact the amount research studies are clicked on for further reading.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Limitations</title><p>One of the limitations of this study is the way in which the count for “hovering” (defined as a reader’s cursor lingering over a link for 1000 milliseconds or more, revealing a rollover label) captures both intentional and unintentional acts. So, while the reported number of hovers is of limited value, there is no reason to believe that the incidental hovers would differ between WPM and W readers. As well, with the pageview data, various strategies were used to exclude pages visited by bots, but the limited effectiveness of these strategies is a known weakness in Wikipedia’s infrastructure. It, again, suggests a tempering of the pageview counts but not the ratios between WPM and W in this regard. This is similarly the case with the exclusion from this study of interwiki links that reduced external link counts, as described in the methods. Lastly, this study focuses only on the English-language version of Wikipedia and therefore our findings are limited to this version of the encyclopedia.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The study has identified a number of distinctions that set WPM pages apart from the rest of Wikipedia. These differences, such as page length and link density, reflect the quality of these pages as information sources. This finding was further supported by differences in reader behavior, such as time spent on page, and amount of external link engagement, particularly the rate readers hover or click on footnote numbers to examine the bibliographic information on the sources contained in the links. This suggests that WPM readers are more engaged in assessing the citation of the external link, which assists in validating and building trust in the content that makes up the WPM pages, than by the opportunity to visit the sources as a gateway for further learning. Subsequent studies of readers engagement with Wikipedia’s external links should investigate the role citations play in what readers learn about a topic and whether there is the potential, especially for readers in health professions, to increase the degree and depth of learning.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Disclaimer</title><p>The views expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, the U.S. Department of Defense, or the U.S. Government.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors wish to acknowledge the value of this opportunity to collaborate with the WMF research team, which began in 2018 with the posting of a <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Investigating_Wikipedia%27s_role_as_a_gateway_to_medical_content">research proposal</ext-link> to Wikimedia’s Meta-Wiki.

It seems that Wikipedia's medical content is no longer the most visited site in the world for medical content and is &quot;losing&quot; to sites that encourage users to ask different questions on the same topic and have multiple answer pages on that same topic.

I assume that normalizing the Wikipedia articles according to their page visits might paint a different picture here with respect to the page visit.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this question on our finding that WikiProject Medicine (WPM) readers clicked on external links less often per view than Wikipedia (W) readers. We investigated ways of normalizing for pageviews and page-length, as two factors that might be associated with this result. The most common approach would be to use matching methods, involving creating matched samples or datasets for, in this case, matching WPM and W for pageviews and for page length. This creates, in effect, random samples for these two factors which then allows one to determine the effect of an intervention, or in this case the extent to which a factor is associated with an external link behavior. But since we set out to determine if and how WPM pages and readers differ from the rest of W pages and readers, our goal has been to describe the pattern of the differences as a whole, rather than ask what would happen if pageviews or page lengths were the same for WPM and W. This helped us realize that the focus on the comprehensive pattern was not previously clear enough, and we have now, thanks to this reviewer’s comment, brought it to the fore in revisions to the research questions and discussion. The principal change is to have introduced a summary table (Table 6) in the discussion that presents the three key factors that distinguish WPM pages from the rest of W, and the five key factors that distinguish WPM readers from W readers. As a result of structuring the results this way, we believe it is easier to grasp consistencies that are to be expected with the reading behaviors of health sciences students and professionals (whose use of WPM has been well established, if not the proportion of WPM readers that they make up). We think that this points to the sort of future research helpfully suggested by a reviewer involving questioning readers either directly about their choices or indirectly through think-aloud protocols. All of that said, if the reviewers still feel that matching methods should be applied, we would, of course, be willing to conduct such an analysis. To reflect the above changes, we have also modified the abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) In the second research question, the motivation behind visiting such external links is postulated.

We have reframed the research questions in the introduction so that they follow the pattern of the study, dealing with differences between WPM and W pages and readers. This had led us to extend the analysis of the greater hovering and footnote-number clicking in the Discussion, in which WPM readers must be gaining additional reassurances from how the title and publication venue of the references can provide scientific characteristics of the study, using the “ideal sources” of systematic reviews and medical textbooks as examples. That said, we fully embrace and now include the reviewer’s point about follow-up qualitative studies among a diversity of users to determine what influences their choices around engagement with external links.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) As the article aims to review WPM content as a gateway to further learning and deeper understanding of a given topic, especially as it is used by both students, health professionals and the general public, one thing that was missing from this effort - an acknowledgement of the importance of both internal links and media files as a means of enhancing understanding, not only that of references and footnotes.

And while our focus remains on the association between Wikipedia and the body of external research, that has now been made clear (in the Introduction), in the context of how richly cross-referenced Wikipedia is and how much of that lateral reading can contribute to the informational and educational quality of WPM pages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) While research till 2016 (Heilman &amp; West) showed that Wikipedia was the most popular site for medical content online, more than sites like WHO, NIH etc, WikiProject Medicine Foundation has shown that this has changed in the last couple of years.

After some discussion among us, as well as searches for relevant literature on it, we wish to respectfully suggest that this comment is out of scope for this paper, given our focus on reader engagement with external links on WPM pages. Based on recent studies on medical and health provider use of Wikipedia (Scaffidi, 2017), we see the relevance of this site for health information is still substantial, and a particularly relevant source for the initial and continuing education of health professionals. We appreciate the reviewers’ encouragement to consider broader issues around such topics as reader interests and questions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
