events during DNA damage or incomplete replication. How the checkpoint response is tailored to different phases of the cell cycle remains poorly understood. The S-phase checkpoint for example results in the slowing of replication, which in budding yeast occurs by Rad53-dependent inhibition of the initiation factors Sld3 and Dbf4. Despite this, we show here that Rad53 phosphorylates both of these substrates throughout the cell cycle at the same sites as in S-phase, suggesting roles for this pathway beyond S-phase. Indeed, we show that Rad53-dependent inhibition of Sld3 and Dbf4 limits re-replication in G2/M, preventing gene amplification. In addition, we show that inhibition of Sld3 and Dbf4 in G1 prevents premature initiation at all origins at the G1/S transition. This study redefines the scope of the ‘S-phase checkpoint’ with implications for understanding checkpoint function in cancers that lack cell cycle controls.</p></abstract><kwd-group

every cell division, the entire genome is replicated once and only once. In eukaryotes, this is achieved by linking DNA replication control to the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Siddiqui et al., 2013</xref>). The first step in replication is the formation of the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) at origins – a process called ‘licensing’. Licensing involves the origin recognition complex 1-6 (Orc1-6) and Cdc6-dependent loading of double hexamers of the Mcm2–7 helicase on double-stranded DNA. Licensing is restricted to late mitosis/early G1 phase by the activity of the APC/C (anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome), which eliminates licensing inhibitors such as cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) and geminin in this window of the cell cycle. In the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, which lacks geminin, CDK inhibits licensing from late G1 phase until mitosis by multiple mechanisms, including direct phosphorylation of Orc2/Orc6 and nuclear exclusion of the Mcm2–7 complex, and by mediating SCF<sup>CDC4</sup>-dependent degradation of Cdc6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blow and Dutta, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nguyen et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, Mcm2–7 double hexamers loaded in late M/early G1 phase are inactive, and replication initiation can only occur after the inactivation of the APC/C at the G1/S transition. APC/C inactivation allows the accumulation of S-phase CDK and Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Labib, 2010</xref>). DDK directly phosphorylates the inactive Mcm2–7 double hexamers, generating a binding site for firing factors including Sld3/Sld7 and Cdc45, while CDK phosphorylates Sld3 and an additional initiation factor Sld2, which via phospho-interactions with Dpb11, results in replisome assembly by poorly understood mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Riera et al., 2017</xref>). This duality of function of CDK, both as an inhibitor of licensing and as an activator of the replisome, is critical to ensure once per cell cycle replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Diffley, 2004</xref>).</p><p>In light of the importance of the linkage between DNA replication control and cell cycle progression, multiple checkpoints exist to regulate DNA synthesis and genome integrity before (G1 checkpoint), during (S-phase checkpoint), and after S-phase (G2/M checkpoint, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hartwell and Weinert, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kastan and Bartek, 2004</xref>). These checkpoints are mediated by the PI3 kinase superfamily checkpoint kinases ATM/ATR (Ataxia telangiectasia mutated/<italic>ATM</italic> and RAD3-related, called Tel1/Mec1 in budding yeast) and the effector checkpoint kinases Chk1/Chk2 (Chk1/Rad53 in budding yeast).</p><p>In G1 phase, DNA damage such as UV photoproducts causes checkpoint-dependent delays in the onset of DNA replication by inhibition of G1/S cyclin–CDK activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lanz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shaltiel et al., 2015</xref>). In humans, the G1–S transition is delayed by ATM-Chk2-mediated stabilisation of p53, resulting in expression of the CDK inhibitor p21, as well as by checkpoint-dependent degradation of cyclin D and the CDK activator Cdc25A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lanz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shaltiel et al., 2015</xref>). In budding yeast, the delay in G1–S occurs in part by Rad53-dependent phosphorylation and inhibition of the Swi6 subunit of the transcriptional activator SBF (SCB binding factor) leading to reduced cyclin transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sidorova and Breeden, 1997</xref>).</p><p>In S-phase, origin firing in unperturbed cells occurs as a continuum throughout S-phase, with some origins firing in the first half (early origins) or the second half of S-phase (late origins). When replication forks emanating from early firing origins stall, for example due to DNA lesions, activation of the S-phase checkpoint kinase response results in the dramatic slowing of replication rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Painter and Young, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Paulovich and Hartwell, 1995</xref>), which occurs in large part through inhibition of late firing origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yekezare et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Similar to G1 phase, checkpoint activation in S-phase in human cells can prevent origin firing through inhibition of CDK activity, for example by Chk1- and Chk2-mediated degradation of the CDK activator Cdc25A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartek et al., 2004</xref>). In budding yeast however, the checkpoint kinase Rad53 blocks late origin firing, not by inhibition of CDK activity, but by directly inhibiting two replication initiation factors: the DDK subunit Dbf4 and the CDK target Sld3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lopez-Mosqueda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zegerman and Diffley, 2010</xref>). Rad53-dependent phosphorylation of Sld3 inhibits its interactions with various other replication factors including Dpb11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lopez-Mosqueda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zegerman and Diffley, 2010</xref>), while recent work has shown that direct interaction between Rad53 and Cdc7-Dbf4 prevents DDK from binding to the Mcm2–7 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abd Wahab and Remus, 2020</xref>). In higher eukaryotes, in addition to inhibition of CDK activity, the checkpoint can also inhibit origin firing through direct targeting of the Sld3 orthologue Treslin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo et al., 2015</xref>) and DDK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Costanzo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, multiple mechanisms exist to ensure the robust inhibition of replication initiation in S-phase by direct targeting of Sld3/Treslin and Dbf4-dependent kinase and by inhibition of CDK activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lanz et al., 2019</xref>). One function of such robust inhibition of origin firing during S-phase in the presence of DNA lesions is to prevent the exhaustion of essential factors, such as topoisomerase activities, by excessive numbers of replisomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morafraile et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Toledo et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>A key proposed feature of the DNA damage checkpoints is that the response is tailored to the cell cycle phase in which the DNA damage occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shaltiel et al., 2015</xref>). Despite this, there is very little evidence to suggest that substrate specificity of the checkpoint kinases changes during the cell cycle. Indeed, in budding yeast, most forms of DNA damage and replication stress converge on the single effector kinase Rad53, but how different checkpoint responses in different cell cycle phases can be mediated by a single kinase is not known. In this study, we set out to explore the specificity of Rad53 towards the replication substrates Sld3 and Dbf4 across the cell cycle in the budding yeast, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. We show that Rad53 phosphorylates both of these substrates throughout the cell cycle at the same sites as in S-phase. From this we hypothesised that although these substrates are deemed to be targets of the ‘S-phase checkpoint’, Rad53 may also prevent aberrant origin firing outside of S-phase. Indeed, we show that Rad53-dependent inhibition of Sld3 and Dbf4 limits re-initiation of replication in G2/M phase and also prevents premature firing of all origins, not just late origins, at the G1/S transition. This study overhauls our understanding of the cell cycle phase specificity of the ‘S-phase checkpoint’ and provides a novel mechanism that restricts replication initiation to a specific window of the cell cycle after DNA damage.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sld3 and Dbf4 are phosphorylated by Rad53 outside of S-phase</title><p>Since the DNA damage checkpoint response can be activated in all phases of the cell cycle, we addressed whether the replication factors Sld3 and Dbf4 could be targeted by Rad53 outside of S-phase <italic>in vivo</italic> in budding yeast. To test this, we first analysed the consequences of DNA damage in G1 phase cells arrested with the mating pheromone alpha factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These experiments were conducted with strains containing a null mutation in the alpha factor protease, <italic>bar1∆</italic>, to ensure that cells were fully arrested in G1 phase and had not started DNA replication. Addition of the UV mimetic drug 4-NQO to G1 phase cells resulted in robust Rad53 activation, as determined by the accumulation of the phospho-shifted forms of the kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Importantly, we observed a dramatic increase in lower mobility forms of Sld3 when Rad53 was activated in G1 phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which was indeed Rad53 dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In line with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mattarocci et al., 2014</xref>), in G1-arrested cells in the absence of 4-NQO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) or in <italic>rad53∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), Sld3 can be seen to migrate as a doublet on phos-tag gels. This was shown to be caused by DDK phosphorylation of Sld3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mattarocci et al., 2014</xref>), but does not affect the DNA damage and Rad53-dependent phosphorylation of Sld3 described here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). For Dbf4, which is an APC/C substrate and partially degraded in alpha factor-arrested cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferreira et al., 2000</xref>), we also observed a mobility shift in G1 phase coincident with Rad53 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dbf4 and Sld3 are phosphorylated by Rad53 after DNA damage in G1 and G2 phase.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Flow cytometry of strains arrested in G1 phase with the mating pheromone alpha factor.

To examine whether the Rad53-dependent inhibition of origin firing helps to prevent RRIGA we adapted an assay to quantitatively assess gene amplification events in G2/M arrested cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Finn and Li, 2013</xref>). Briefly, a marker gene (in this case LEU2, which allows growth on media lacking leucine) was split with some remaining homology across an origin that re-initiates when licensing control is lost (ARS317 – see for example <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Re-initiation at ARS317 followed by fork-breakage and strand annealing at the regions of LEU2 homology results in gene amplification and the generation of a functional LEU2 gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>).

To test this, we over-expressed a truncated form of the SBF transcription factor Swi4 (Swi4-t), which lacks the C-terminus required for interaction with Swi6 and thus cannot be inhibited by Rad53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sidorova and Breeden, 1997</xref>).

To assess this, we analysed the replication dynamics of the time course in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref> by high-throughput sequencing and copy number analysis. At the earliest time point (20 min), while the <italic>swi4-t</italic> over-expressing strain alone had barely begun to replicate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, chromosome VII as an example), the <italic>swi4-t sld3-A dbf4-A</italic> strain showed peaks of replication initiation at the earliest firing origins (e.g., see *, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), even though Rad53 is highly activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

These genetic interactions are consistent with an important role for Rad53-dependent inhibition of origin firing in preventing precocious replication after DNA damage in G1 phase.</p><p>Here we show that the two critical targets of the S-phase checkpoint-mediated inhibition of origin firing, Sld3 and Dbf4, are actually regulated by Rad53 after DNA damage throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). This has important implications for understanding the consequences of inappropriate re-replication in human cells, where the role of the checkpoint differs depending on the cell cycle phase in which re-replication occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klotz-Noack et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2007</xref>). By combining tight cell cycle arrests with the separation-of-function mutants, <italic>sld3-A dbf4-A</italic>, we show specifically that the checkpoint-dependent inhibition of origin firing limits further re-replication and gene amplifications in G2 phase when licensing control is compromised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This pathway is likely to be evolutionarily conserved, as checkpoint activation in S-phase in human cells also appears to limit re-replication through inhibition of Dbf4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). As tandem head-to-tail duplications are a prominent feature of many cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Menghi et al., 2018</xref>), knowledge of the pathways that prevent this form of structural variation may be important for understanding oncogenesis.</p><p>In addition to preventing re-replication in G2, we show that the checkpoint also inhibits the replication initiation factors Sld3 and Dbf4 to delay all origin firing after DNA damage in G1 phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This likely increases the time for DNA repair to occur before replication begins and may also serve to increase the window of time where origin firing and licensing are mutually exclusive, preventing re-replication. It is interesting that failure to inhibit Sld3 and Dbf4 alone has little effect on the G1/S transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), probably because Sld3 (and Sld2) act downstream of CDK activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This study therefore provides evidence that two inter-connected pathways are important for restricting replication after DNA damage in G1: inhibition of G1/S CDK activity and direct Inhibition of replication initiation factors.</p><p>Mutations in genes such as Rb and p53 that control the G1/S transition and the G1 checkpoint response, respectively, are amongst the most common mutations in cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Malumbres and Barbacid, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Massagué, 2004</xref>). Work from yeast to humans has shown that defects in the G1/S transition results in increased dependence on the checkpoint kinases for survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rundle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sidorova and Breeden, 2002</xref>). The identification of the checkpoint inhibition of all origin firing as a failsafe mechanism that prevents precocious S-phase entry when the G1 checkpoint is compromised described here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) may provide a potential mechanistic rationale for the selective targeting of p53/Rb mutant cancers using Chk1 and ATR inhibitors, which are currently in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bradbury et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Tim Formosa as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Bruce Stillman (Reviewer #2); Karim Labib (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Johnson et al. use the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> system to show that oxidative damage triggers phosphorylation of DNA replication initiation factors Sld3 and Dbf4 by activated Rad53 kinase in cells arrested in either G1 or G2/M. They also show that regulating the activities of these factors outside of S-phase involves the same phosphorylation target sites that are used within S-phase. Finally, they show that the inappropriate replication that occurs in the presence of damage when the checkpoint is inactivated follows the normal timing program, with early origins activated first. These results show that the same checkpoint controls that monitor S phase progression are also used during other phases of the cell cycle. The effects during G1 provide a direct mechanism for inhibiting initiation, in addition to the previously studied parallel block to S phase entry produced by the effects of Rad53 on CDK activation. The effects in G2 limit re-replication, which was previously shown to be regulated by CDK activity as well. This work takes advantage of the high resolution available in the yeast system to concisely establish a broader role for the S-phase checkpoint system than had been previously assumed, and to cleanly demonstrate how multiple factors contribute to maintaining genomic stability in the presence of DNA damage.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should submit their DNA sequence copy number data to a public DNA sequence database</p><p>2) Introduction: The authors should provide further support for the contention that S-phase checkpoint controls are currently assumed to act only within S phase.</p><p>3) Subsection “Rad53-dependent phosphorylation of Sld3 and Dbf4 reduces re-replication in G2 phase” and Figure 3B: The change in flow cytometry profiles seems small; have potential changes in cell size (FSC, SSC) and the variation in mitochondrial DNA associated with cell size been accounted for?</p><p>4) Introduction: Parallels to the human DNA damage checkpoints should be included here, especially the role of p21-CIP. In general, more discussion of the parallel contributions of phosphorylation by Rad53 to Sld3-Dbf4 regulation and CDK activity would strengthen the manuscript.

To support this point, we have included the citation (Shaltiel et al., 2015) which states in the Abstract “despite the shared mechanisms of DNA damage detection throughout the cell cycle, the checkpoint and its reversal are precisely tuned to each cell cycle phase”. We think that our analysis of checkpoint inhibition of origin firing throughout the cell cycle shows that for at least this branch of the “S-phase” checkpoint there is no evidence of tailoring to a single phase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection “Rad53-dependent phosphorylation of Sld3 and Dbf4 reduces re-replication in G2 phase” and Figure 3B: The change in flow cytometry profiles seems small; have potential changes in cell size (FSC, SSC) and the variation in mitochondrial DNA associated with cell size been accounted for?</p></disp-quote><p>Cell size has been accounted for in the flow cytometer as FSC and SSC of all samples was the same. We decided that the best way to demonstrate genomic re-replication was to perform DNA sequencing of the experiment described in this comment by the reviewers. By over-expressing a subset of pre-RC mutants that are refractory to inhibition by CDK (Mcm7-NLS, Orc6-A, PGal-Cdc6) we observed re-replication mostly on Chromosome III (see new Figure 3—figure supplement 1C), which is in line with previous work (Green et al., 2006). This limited re-replication also underlines why the changes in DNA content by flow cytometry are modest even in the Mcm7-NLS, Orc6-A, PGal-Cdc6 strain. Importantly we observe greater re-replication of chromosome III when Sld3 and Dbf4 cannot be inhibited by Rad53 (new Figure 3B). From this sequencing we also observe that mitochondrial DNA content is equivalent between the strains (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1B). Together with the other data in Figure 3, we are confident that Rad53 can inhibit Sld3 and Dbf4 in G2 phase to limit the rate of re-replication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Introduction: Parallels to the human DNA damage checkpoints should be included here, especially the role of p21-CIP.

We then circle back to the parallel pathways of CDK and replication factor inhibition in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 1B upper panel, Figure 1—figure supplement 1B upper panel, Figure 2A upper panel: Sld3 appears as a doublet in untreated G1 cells (0 minute sample).

We include a new figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C) without tagged Sld3, with and without inhibition of CDK, which clearly identifies these bands as being specific to CDK phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Sld3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 2B, D: The level of the dbf4-A mutant protein appears to be higher in cells compared to the Dbf4 WT protein. As Dbf4 is limiting for initiation and the effects of combining dbf4-A with swi4-t in Figure 4 are rather subtle, the authors should consider the possibility that the effects are due to overexpression of dbf4-A protein rather than to the lack of phosphorylation.</p></disp-quote><p>In this study we have used two different mutants of Dbf4; 19A, which lacks all the Rad53 phospho-sites and 4A, which lacks the key Rad53 sites that inhibit Dbf4’s role in origin firing. (Note that the 4A sites are a subset of the 19A sites). Also, in light of point 8 raised by the reviewers, we realise that this is confusing and we did not explicitly state which allele was used in Figure 2, for which we apologise. For all phenotypic assays (including Figure 4) we always use Dbf4-4A, because this allele is fully functional for origin firing and the protein is expressed at wild type levels. Therefore, the expression level of Dbf4-4A is not an issue for Figure 4.</p><p>For Figure 2B and D (and only in these figures) we used Dbf4-19A, because it lacks all available Rad53 phospho-sites and therefore gives a more robust loss of phosphorylation by western blot. As pointed out by the reviewers, this 19A allele is more expressed than the wild type protein (and it’s a hypomorph, which may be why cells adapt by over-expressing it). We have rectified these issues as follows:</p><p>1) At the first mention of Dbf4 phospho-site mutants (subsection “Sld3 and Dbf4 are phosphorylated by Rad53 outside of S-phase”), we explain the difference between these 2 alleles. From then on, we refer to Dbf4-4A as Dbf4-A and Dbf4-19A as it is.</p><p>2) We clearly state that Dbf4-19A was used for Figure 2B and D in the figure, legend and the text.</p><p>3) We have included a new figure which shows that Dbf4-4A is expressed at very similar levels to wild type and also shows defects in Rad53 phosphorylation in G1 phase (new Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Subsection “Rad53-dependent phosphorylation of Sld3 and Dbf4 reduces re-replication in G2 phase” and Figure 3D: The statistical significance of the small change reported with 3 replicates suggests that further repeats would be needed to support the conclusion here and in Figure 4F.</p></disp-quote><p>The statistical significance of these differences is less than 0.05, so the data supports our conclusions. More repeats would indeed increase the significance further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The use of dbf4 alleles to establish which phosphorylation sites are important should be clarified. It is not always clear whether the 4A allele (mutations in the sites that are essential in S phase) or the 19A allele (mutations in all mapped phosphorylation sites) are being used in specific experiments. This could affect whether or not the conclusion that the same sites are important in S phase and G1/G2 is valid, so this needs to be clarified and the reasons for using different alleles justified.</p></disp-quote><p>See point 6.</p></body></sub-article></article>
