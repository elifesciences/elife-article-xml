Mutations in <italic>protocadherin-19</italic> (<italic>PCDH19</italic>) result in a female-limited, infant-onset form of epilepsy (PCDH19-FE). Over 100 mutations in <italic>PCDH19</italic> have been identified in patients with PCDH19-FE, about half of which are missense mutations in the adhesive extracellular domain. Neither the mechanism of homophilic adhesion by PCDH19, nor the biochemical effects of missense mutations are understood. Here we present a crystallographic structure of the minimal adhesive fragment of the zebrafish Pcdh19 extracellular domain. This structure reveals the adhesive interface for Pcdh19, which is broadly relevant to both non-clustered δ and clustered protocadherin subfamilies. In addition, we show that several PCDH19-FE missense mutations localize to the adhesive interface and abolish Pcdh19 adhesion in <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, thus revealing the biochemical basis of their pathogenic effects during brain development.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18529.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18529.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18529.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>As the brain develops, its basic building blocks – cells called neurons – need to form the correct connections with one another in order to give rise to neural circuits.

Mutations in <italic>PCDH19</italic> cause an X-linked, female-limited form of infant-onset epilepsy (PCDH19 female epilepsy, PCDH19-FE; OMIM 300088) that is associated with intellectual disability, as well as compulsive or aggressive behavior and autistic features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dibbens et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Scheffer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Depienne and LeGuern, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">van Harssel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Leonardi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Thiffault et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Terracciano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Walters et al., 2014</xref>). To date, well over 100 distinct mutations in <italic>PCDH19</italic> have been identified in epilepsy patients, making it the second most clinically relevant gene in epilepsy. Approximately half of these mutations are missense mutations distributed throughout the extracellular domain of the PCDH19 protein. Despite the clear importance of <italic>PCDH19</italic> and other non-clustered δ-protocadherins to neural development, their specific roles are only beginning to be revealed. For example, Pcdh7, Pcdh17 and Pcdh18b are involved in axon outgrowth or arborization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Piper et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hayashi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biswas et al., 2014</xref>), while several δ-protocadherins, including Pcdh19, regulate cell motility during early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yamamoto et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aamar and Dawid, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biswas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Emond et al., 2009</xref>).

However, it is not known how mutations in <italic>PCDH19</italic> lead to PCDH19-FE.</p><p>Cadherins typically mediate adhesion using their extracellular domains, which are made of two or more consecutive extracellular cadherin (EC) repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Takeichi, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brasch et al., 2012</xref>). The adhesion mechanism used by classical cadherins is well known and involves a tip-to-tip interaction that is stabilized by the reciprocal exchange of tryptophan residues at the N-terminal EC1 repeat most distant from the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Overduin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shapiro et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nagar et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boggon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Patel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sivasankar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harrison et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ciatto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Leckband and Sivasankar, 2012</xref>). However, PCDH19 along with the rest of the non-classical cadherins lack these critical tryptophan residues and must mediate adhesion by an alternative mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Emond et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sotomayor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biswas et al., 2010</xref>). In the case of the non-classical protocadherin-15 and cadherin-23 proteins, an adhesive interface is formed by overlapping, antiparallel interactions of their EC1 and EC2 tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elledge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sotomayor et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Geng et al., 2013</xref>). For clustered protocadherins, recent binding assays and structures suggest that adhesion is mediated by an antiparallel interaction of fully overlapping EC1 to EC4 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rubinstein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nicoludis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goodman et al., 2016</xref>). Yet how non-clustered δ-protocadherins and PCDH19 form adhesive bonds and how these bonds are altered by disease-causing mutations is unknown.</p><p>Here we present crystals structures of the highly homologous zebrafish Protocadherin-19 (Pcdh19) encompassing repeats EC1-4 and EC3-4. The structures allow us to map &gt;70% of the disease-causing missense mutations and provide a structural framework to interpret their functional impact. In addition, the structures suggest two possible homophilic adhesive interfaces, and complementary binding assays validate one of them, which is affected by multiple PCDH19-FE mutations. This interface involves fully overlapping EC1 to EC4 domains and likely represents a general interaction mechanism for the non-clustered δ-protocadherins.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To understand the mechanism of Pcdh19 function and to determine the structural role of PCDH19-FE mutations, the <italic>Danio rerio</italic> Pcdh19 EC1-4 and the EC3-4 fragments (70% identity, 83% similarity to <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> EC1-4) were produced in <italic>E. coli,</italic> refolded from inclusion bodies, and used for crystallization and structural determination (see Materials and methods).

These mutations can be classified in three groups. The first group (18 mutations at 14 locations) corresponds to residues whose side chains are pointing toward the hydrophobic core of an EC repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). The second group involves residues whose side chains are at the surface of the protein (10 mutations at 10 sites; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>). The last group includes residues at calcium-binding motifs, with 19 locations affected by 23 different mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,E–G</xref>). Mutations in each group are predicted to have different effects on the protein’s structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>PCDH19-FE mutations altering residues in the first group may often cause protein misfolding or structural instability. For instance, mutations L81R and I115K (corresponding to L58 and I92 in the crystal structure) would result in impossible conformations in which a positively charged residue side chain is pointing toward the hydrophobic core of EC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, these mutants are unlikely to fold properly. Mutation L25P (L4) will interfere with hydrogen bonding and secondary structure formation, while V72G (V50) is subtler, as it replaces a rather large hydrophobic residue with a different and smaller side chain that may only affect the packing of the EC1 hydrophobic core. The mutation A153T (A130) in EC2, in which a small hydrophobic residue is replaced by a larger hydrophilic threonine, may result in structural instability as well. A similar analysis can be done for all 18 mutations in this group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Protein misfolding and structural instability caused by these mutations are likely to inhibit PCDH19 adhesive function, either directly, allosterically, or by altering the strength of cell-cell adhesion due to a reduced number of functional molecules on the cell surface.</p><p>The effect of ten PCDH19-FE mutations on residues with side chains at the protein surface (second group) is less clear. Two of them (S276P and L433P) may affect packing and folding, as these mutations to proline are predicted to prevent formation of hydrogen bonds important for β strand formation and loop structure. Six of them are involved in putative homophilic interfaces, and their effect on binding is discussed below. The V191L mutation site is not directly involved in homophilic binding, but it is near residues that are, and may allosterically alter binding. Alternatively, this mutation may alter interactions with N-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Emond et al., 2011</xref>) or other PCDH19 molecular partners yet to be determined. The last mutation, D417H, is not involved in any known interface, but this epilepsy patient has a pair of mutations in PCDH19 (D417H and D596Y). It is unclear whether both mutations contribute to the epileptic syndrome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Higurashi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoshina et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The third group of mutations involves residues that are at one of the canonical calcium-binding motifs between EC repeats (XEX<sup>BASE</sup> and DRE from the first EC repeat, DXNDN from the linker, and DXD and XDX<sup>TOP</sup> from the second repeat). Two of these PCDH19-FE mutations involve charge reversal for a calcium-coordinating residue (E31K at X<bold>E</bold>X and E307K at DY<bold>E</bold>), and may result in impaired folding and impaired calcium binding. Twelve PCDH19-FE mutations in this group replace a charged, calcium-coordinating residue by a neutral residue (D90V at DR<bold>E,</bold> D121N at <bold>D</bold>XNDN, D157N at DX<bold>D,</bold> E199Q at DR<bold>E</bold>, D230N at <bold>D</bold>XNDN, E249G at X<bold>E</bold>X, D264H at <bold>D</bold>XD, D341G at DXN<bold>D</bold>N, D375Y at <bold>D</bold>XD, D377N and D377H at DX<bold>D</bold>, and E414Q at DR<bold>E</bold>). Some of these mutations only affect charge, but not the size of the side chain (D to N and E to Q), and may decrease the affinity for calcium. Others involve more drastic side-chain size changes (D to Y or G) and will not only impair calcium binding, but might also induce protein instability. In addition, three mutations alter the size, but not the charge of a coordinating residue (E249D at X<bold>E</bold>X, D341E at DXN<bold>D</bold>N, and D377E DX<bold>D</bold>), indicating that even subtle perturbations at the calcium-binding linkers might result in impaired function. Three more PCDH19-FE mutations involve substituting a coordinating asparagine residue by a serine (N232S and N340S at DX<bold>N</bold>DN, and N234S at DXND<bold>N</bold>), with one of these mutations present in over twenty unrelated individuals (N340S). Similarly, the mutation NP342-343KT at DXND<bold>N</bold> involves a coordinating asparagine residue, but it is mutated to lysine and accompanied by a proline to threonine mutation. In addition, one mutation involves the non-calcium binding residue of the D<bold>R</bold>E motif (R198L), which may disrupt calcium binding. The last PCDH19-FE mutation in this group involves duplication of three residues (SEA139-141dup at X<bold>E</bold>X), one of which is directly coordinating calcium. This duplication might change the architecture of the loop and alter calcium binding as well. Overall, mutations at PCDH19 calcium-binding motifs are varied, with some predicted to have drastic effects on protein folding and calcium binding, and others predicted to have a minor effect yet still causing protein malfunction.</p><p>There are 19 PCDH19-FE missense mutations not found within EC1-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), 14 of which are at conserved calcium-binding motifs (N557K, D594H, D596G,H,V,Y) or at other structurally conserved sites for cadherin repeats (P451L, G486R, G513R, L543P, P561R, G601D, V642M, L652P). Two mutations involve insertion or deletion of residues (N449_H450insN and S489del), and will likely disrupt β strand folding. However, the effect of the remaining three is unclear (R550P in β strand G of EC5, P567L in β strand A of EC6, and D618N likely at the end of β strand D); perhaps they are involved in <italic>cis</italic> interactions with PCDH19 or other cadherins.</p><p>To gain insights into the molecular mechanism of the most common PCDH19-FE mutation, N340S (N317S, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), we introduced this mutation into the Pcdh19 EC3-4 construct and compared its thermal stability with the wild-type (WT) Pcdh19 fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). The Pcdh19 EC3-4 N317S fragment refolded well as assessed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), but its melting temperature is considerably lower (40.7 ± 0.6°C <italic>vs.</italic> 52.4 ± 0.3°C), even in the presence of 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Another PCDH19-FE mutation of a surface residue (E313K, equivalent to E290K) did not show a dramatic shift in melting temperature (50.4 ± 0.1°C). These SEC and thermal stability results indicate that the EC3-4 fragment carrying the N317S mutation is folded, and may bind calcium, yet it is not as stable as the wild-type fragment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Antiparallel interfaces in crystal contacts of the Pcdh19 EC1-4 structure</title><p>Crystal structures have previously revealed the adhesive interfaces for classical cadherins, clustered protocadherins, and the protocadherin-15 and cadherin-23 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nagar et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boggon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Patel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ciatto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sotomayor et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nicoludis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goodman et al., 2016</xref>). Although the Pcdh19 EC3-4 structure does not reveal any relevant interface, the Pcdh19 EC1-4 structure does. The purified Pcdh19 EC1-4 fragment elutes in two well-defined peaks in size exclusion chromatography experiments (SEC), with these peaks most likely representing monomeric and dimeric states in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Pcdh19 EC1-4 crystals were grown from the putative dimer SEC peak elution, and two plausible adhesive interfaces are observed in our Pcdh19 EC1-4 structure. The first one, which we will refer to as Pcdh19-I1, arises from contacts between the two Pcdh19 EC1-4 molecules in the asymmetric unit, and involves a fully-overlapped antiparallel dimer in which EC1 from one molecule interacts with EC4 from the other (EC1:EC4), EC2 with EC3 (EC2:EC3), EC3 with EC2 (EC3:EC2), and EC4 with EC1 (EC4:EC1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Within the same protein crystal structure, the second antiparallel interface (Pcdh19-I2) involves the opposite side of Pcdh19 with observed EC2:EC4, EC3:EC3, and EC4:EC2 interactions, as well as potential (not observed) EC1:EC5 and EC5:EC1 contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

In contrast, the possible antiparallel Pcdh19-I2 interface is predicted by <italic>NOXclass</italic> to be non physiological, as its smaller interface area (~930 Å<sup>2</sup>) and the nature of its contacts matches those of crystal packing interactions (42.97% biological, 20.21% obligate). Yet, both interface areas are larger than 856 Å<sup>2</sup>, an empirical cut-off that can distinguish biological interfaces from crystal contacts with 85% accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ponstingl et al., 2000</xref>), and our analysis of the Pcdh19-I2 interface lacks contributions from possible EC1-EC5 contacts, which might be significant. Moreover, shape correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lawrence and Colman, 1993</xref>) for Pcdh19-I1 is lower than for the Pcdh19-I2 interface (S<sub>c-I1</sub> = 0.44 <italic>vs</italic>. S<sub>c-I2</sub> = 0.61), as there is a large gap between the main EC2-EC3:EC3-EC2 contacts and the EC1-EC4:EC4-EC1 interactions zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>To further differentiate between the possible Pcdh19-I1 and Pcdh19-I2 interfaces, we evaluated whether any of the six PCDH19-FE mutations altering surface residues at crystal contacts, but not necessarily protein structure, could interfere with binding. Five of these mutations (S139L, T146R, P149S, E313K, and T404I; all at conserved sites) change residues involved in the Pcdh19-I1 interface (S116, T123, P126, E290, T381 respectively in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–E</xref>), where we define residues at a given interface as those with a buried surface area that is at least 20% of their accessible surface area according to PISA. In all cases we predict altered EC1-4 homophilic binding, as the size and nature of the residue is changed by each mutation (hydrophobic <italic>vs.</italic> hydrophilic; charged <italic>vs.</italic> non-charged). The remaining mutation (H203P) involves a non-conserved residue at the Pcdh19-I2 interface, which could impair its formation (R180 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). However, the patient with the H203P mutation also carries another PCDH19-FE mutation (F206C) at a location mutated in other epilepsy patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Depienne et al., 2011</xref>); thus it is unclear if H203P is contributing to epilepsy. In contrast, all five PCDH19-FE mutations at the Pcdh19-I1 interface are likely causal, which suggests that Pcdh19-I1 is relevant <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>We also analyzed predicted glycosylation sites that might interfere with binding and thereby reveal non-physiological interfaces, as observed for VE-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brasch et al., 2011</xref>). There are 14 glycosylation sites within EC1-4, and none of them involve residues at the Pcdh19-I1 interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). An O-linked glycosylation site is predicted to be at the Pcdh19-I2 interface (T232), and an additional O-linked glycosylation site is predicted for the human PCDH19 protein at S204 (the equivalent N202 in Pcdh19 is predicted to be non-glycosylated), also at the Pcdh19-I2 interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Glycation sites, for which sugar molecules might be added randomly and to long-lived proteins, are predicted at both interfaces (K156 and K308 in Pcdh19-I1 and K204 in Pcdh19-I2), but may not interfere directly with either, since glycation depends on environmental conditions and it has never been reported for cadherins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Salahuddin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Simm et al., 2015</xref>).

The larger surface area of the Pcdh19-I1 dimer, the nature of the residues involved, the number of PCDH19-FE mutations at this interface, and the lack of predicted glycosylation sites, all suggest that the Pcdh19-I1 interface may occur and be functional <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Binding assays probing Pcdh19 interfaces</title><p>To conclusively test which binding interface mediates Pcdh19 adhesion, and whether PCDH19-FE mutations at the protein surface can interfere with one of the two possible Pcdh19 interfaces described above, we used modified bead aggregations assays, mutagenesis, and size exclusion chromatography experiments.

Mapping of all interaction sites to the Pcdh19 EC1-4 topology diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) reveals a pattern for common interacting domains in odd and even EC repeats across these structures, which include the F-G β hairpin and β strand A for repeats EC1 and EC3, as well as the A-B and D-E β hairpins for EC2 and EC4. While there are differences in some of the interacting domains, dimeric arrangements, and contact details, including diversity of interfacial residues, clustered protocadherins seem to use the same binding mechanism that Pcdh19 uses to mediate adhesion.</p><p>A conserved RGD sequence motif within Pcdh19 EC2 (residues 158 to 160) at its D-E loop is similar to an integrin-binding RGD site within EC1 (C-D loop) in the α-protocadherins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ruoslahti, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mutoh et al., 2004</xref>). The EC1 RGD motif is exposed in the <italic>Mm</italic> Pcdhα4 and <italic>Mm</italic> Pcdhα7 homo-dimers while the EC2 RGD motif of Pcdh19 (also present in Pcdh17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim et al., 2011</xref>]) is buried at the EC2:EC3 contacts in the Pcdh19-I1 interface. This suggests that homophilic binding could regulate the availability of this potential, untested, integrin-binding site.</p><p>Pcdh19 belongs to the δ2-protocadherin subfamily, and given the sequence similarity among subfamily members, it is likely that all use the same dimer interface to mediate adhesion. This is less obvious for the δ1 subfamily, with members that have seven EC repeats and that display some critical differences at interaction sites, such as the presence of a positively charged residue (R or K) at position 290, where most δ2 members have a negatively charged glutamate that interacts with an arginine at position 158 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">5</xref>). The PCDH19-FE E313K mutation at this site (E290) prevents binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,H–I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that δ1-protocadherins, which effectively carry the same mutation, should use a different interface to mediate adhesion. Yet, residues at position 157 and 158 in δ1-protocadherins are also charge swapped, with aspartates and glutamates that would restore this critical salt-bridge interaction at the EC2:EC3 interface, and at the same time prevent heterophilic interactions with δ2-protocadherins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">5</xref>). Thus, it is likely that all non-clustered δ-protocadherins use fully overlapped EC1-4 antiparallel interfaces, like the one observed for Pcdh19, to mediate adhesion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion and conclusions</title><p>The non-clustered δ-protocadherins are increasingly linked to human neurodevelopmental disorders, emphasizing both their importance to brain development and their relevance to human health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Redies et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Redies et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hirabayashi and Yagi, 2014</xref>). In particular, mutations in <italic>PCDH19</italic> cause a female-limited form of infant-onset epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dibbens et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Scheffer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Depienne and LeGuern, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">van Harssel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Leonardi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Thiffault et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Terracciano et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, it is imperative to understand the developmental roles of PCDH19 and other non-clustered δ-protocadherins, the structural basis of homophilic adhesion by these molecules, and the functional impact of pathogenic missense mutations. The structural and biochemical data presented here provide a first view on the molecular mechanism of Pcdh19 adhesion, which is likely used by all non-clustered δ and clustered protocadherins. Moreover, our Pcdh19 EC1-4 structural model shows &gt; 70% of the missense mutations identified in PCDH19-FE patients, and reveals the biochemical basis for the deleterious effects for many of these mutations.</p><p>The Pcdh19 EC1-4 structure reveals an antiparallel dimer that is consistent with a <italic>trans</italic> adhesive interface, a conclusion supported by multiple lines of evidence. Notably, several missense mutations identified in PCDH19-FE patients localize to this interface. Two of these missense mutations (T146R and E313K) impair dimerization, as assessed by analytical gel filtration, and adhesion as assessed in bead aggregation assays, with and without N-cadherin. Sequence analysis suggests that the antiparallel adhesive mechanism presented here is broadly relevant to other, related δ-protocadherins. Recent work with clustered protocadherins, implicated in self-avoidance and self/non-self recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lefebvre et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kostadinov and Sanes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yagi, 2012</xref>), have revealed a similar antiparallel adhesive interface for these clustered protocadherins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rubinstein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nicoludis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goodman et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the Pcdh19-I1 adhesive interface observed in our Pcdh19 EC1-4 structure likely represents the mechanism used by both non-clustered δ-protocadherins and clustered protocadherins, which, together, represent the largest group within the cadherin superfamily.</p><p>Our structural data for Pcdh19, as well as recent work with the clustered protocadherins raises an interesting conundrum. The adhesive interface for protocadherins is extensive and involves interactions extending throughout EC1-4. This contrasts sharply with the adhesive interface of classical cadherins, which is restricted to EC1 and involves the reciprocal swap of Aβ-strands that is stabilized by burying Trp2 in a hydrophobic pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brasch et al., 2012</xref>). However, the <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> for dimerization of α- and β-protocadherins is in the micromolar range (similar to classical cadherins), bead aggregation and cell-based assays have consistently shown weak adhesion by both non-clustered and clustered protocadherins, and protocadherins are widely recognized as being only weakly adhesive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schreiner and Weiner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Thu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sano et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rubinstein et al., 2015</xref>). This disparity suggests that other mechanisms could modulate protocadherin adhesion <italic>in vivo</italic>. For instance, <italic>cis</italic>-oligomerization could compete with <italic>trans</italic> adhesive interactions, or interactions with other proteins, including N-cadherin, could sequester protocadherins or mask their adhesive interface. Further studies will be required to better understand protocadherin adhesion, how it may be altered in the presence of N-cadherin, and how it is regulated <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>In addition to mutations that disrupt adhesion, our data reveal the potential effects of two other classes of mutations. In the first class, many mutations are predicted to directly impair folding and stability, which could lead to reduced levels of protein on the surface, due to impaired trafficking or enhanced protein degradation. In the second, PCDH19-FE mutations affecting calcium-binding sites are likely to cause shifts in calcium affinity as well as protein instability. Similar mutations in cadherin-23 and protocadherin-15 have been shown to decrease protein affinity for calcium, with <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> shifts that are relevant in the context of the low calcium concentration to which these proteins are exposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sotomayor et al., 2010</xref>). Yet PCDH19 is expected to be in interstitial space with high calcium concentration, so it is more likely that the relevant effect of PCDH19-FE mutations at calcium-binding sites is compromised stability (even at saturating calcium concentrations), as shown here for the N340S mutation. Finally, analysis of one PCDH19-FE mutation within EC1-4, and three within EC5-6, reveal no obvious predicted consequences at the structural level, as they are exposed residues that should not affect calcium-binding, protein stability or adhesion. These mutations may impact a variety of protein-protein interactions. Although the physiological relevance is unclear, both non-clustered and clustered protocadherins can form <italic>cis</italic>-homo- or <italic>cis</italic>-hetero-oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schreiner and Weiner, 2010</xref>), and mutations affecting the formation of <italic>cis</italic>-oligomers could adversely impact protocadherin function. Similarly, protocadherins participate in a variety of protein complexes beyond homophilic <italic>trans</italic> adhesion: Pcdh19 has been shown to associate in <italic>cis</italic> with N-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Emond et al., 2011</xref>); protocadherins associate with the Wnt co-receptor, RYK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berndt et al., 2011</xref>); PAPC interacts with Frizzled-7 and FLRT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kraft et al., 2012</xref>); and Pcdh17 and Pcdh19 have highly conserved RGD sequences, suggesting that they may interact with integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ruoslahti, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mutoh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, further experimental characterization of key mutants <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> will continue to reveal correlations between structural defects, cellular-level defects, and different aspects of PCDH19-FE.</p><p>The non-clustered protocadherins are increasingly recognized as a family of molecules that play important roles during neural development. In addition to the role of PCDH19 in epilepsy, mutation of <italic>PCDH12</italic> was found to underlie a syndrome of microcephaly that is associated with epilepsy and developmental disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aran et al., 2016</xref>).

Ongoing work will likely uncover further links between members of this family and neurodevelopmental disorders. Our Pcdh19 EC1-4 model is the first to show the structural basis of adhesion by the non-clustered δ-protocadherins, and reveals that some of the missense mutations identified in PCDH19-FE occur at the adhesive interface and act by abolishing adhesion. This represents an initial stage in understanding the mechanisms of non-clustered δ-protocadherin homophilic adhesion and provides insight into the biochemical basis of protocadherin-based neurodevelopmental disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and ﻿methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning and mutagenesis</title><p>Zebrafish Pcdh19 repeats EC1-4 and EC3-4 were subcloned into NdeI and XhoI sites of the pET21a vector for bacterial expression.

The experiments were repeated three to nine times using protein at 0.3 mg/ml for WT (n = 9), N317S (n = 9), and E290K (n = 3) in buffer (20 mM TrisHCl [pH 8.0], 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 mM DTT) mixed with SYPRO Orange dye (final concentration 5x; Invitrogen). Fluorescent measurements were performed in a BioRad CFX96 RT-PCR instrument while samples were heated from 10°C to 95°C in 0.2°C steps.

The Pcdh19ECFc fusion constructs were transfected alone or with NcadEC W2A/R14E His into HEK293 cells using calcium-phosphate transfection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kwon and Firestein, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barry et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jiang and Chen, 2006</xref>). Briefly, solution A (10 µg of plasmid DNA and 250 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) was added drop-wise to solution B (2x HBS) while mildly vortexing, and the final transfection solution was added drop-wise to two 100 mm dishes of cultured HEK293 cells. The next day, cells were rinsed twice with 1xPBS and serum-free media. Cells were allowed to grow in the serum-free media for 2–3 days before collecting the media containing the secreted Fc fusions. The media was concentrated using ultracel (Millipore) and incubated with 1.5 µl of protein G Dynabeads (Invitrogen) while rotating at 4°C for 1–3 hr. The beads were washed in binding buffer (50 mM TrisHCl [pH 7.5], 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, and 0.2% BSA) and split into two tubes with either 2 mM EDTA or 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Beads were allowed to aggregate in a glass depression slide in a humidified chamber for 60 min without motion, followed by two 1 min intervals of rocking (five oscillations/min, ±7° from horizontal). Images were collected upon adding EDTA or CaCl<sub>2</sub>, after 60 min incubation, and after each rocking interval using a microscope (AxioStar; Carl Zeiss) with a 10x objective. Bead aggregates were quantified using ImageJ software as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Emond et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Emond and Jontes, 2014</xref>). Briefly, the images were thresholded, the area of the detected aggregate particles was measured in units of pixels, and the average size was calculated. Assays were repeated three times from separate protein preps and their mean aggregate size (± SEM) at each time point was plotted. Assays were excluded from analysis only if western blots failed to show protein expression.</p><p>Western blots were performed on a portion of media containing the Fc fusion proteins before incubation with the beads to confirm expression and secretion of the protein. The media was mixed with sample loading dye, boiled for 5 min and loaded onto 10% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) for electrophoresis.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior Editor) and two reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper presents a structural analysis of protocadherin-19, a member of the non-clustered protocadherin subfamily, and its homophilic adhesive mechanism. Unlike classical cadherins, the interaction involves antiparallel association of the first 4 cadherin domains (ECs). The authors verify the importance of the crystallographically-observed interface with mutations that ablate homodimer formation, although a negative control with the alternative interface is not presented. They can also rationalize the extensive set of natural mutations associated with the female-limited form of infant-onset epilepsy. Sequence analysis and comparison to the known interfaces of α and β protocadherins indicates that the mode homodimerization observed here, which is very different from that of classical cadherins, is likely to be common to all protocadherins.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agree that the structural analysis indicates that the antiparallel dimeric arrangement is a general feature of protocadherins, and that this represents a significant contribution to the field. However, given the earlier work of Jontes and colleagues on the need for N-cadherin in biologically relevant adhesion, it is not clear whether the homophilic interface described for PDCH19 here has a biological function. The extensive analysis of FE mutations does not provide any insight into this problem, and the effects of many of them on EC folding or Ca<sup>2+</sup> ligation could have been predicted from sequence analysis. To strengthen the case that the homophilic interface is in fact relevant to biological adhesion, the authors need to assess if the loss of adhesion in the homodimer interface mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) is maintained in the presence of the N-cadherin extracellular fragment used in the 2011 paper. Although this would not distinguish whether these affect homophilic adhesion or an allosteric effect of N-cadherin, if adhesion is lost in the mutant in the presence of N-cadherin they would have a strong case for biological relevance of the interface. In this regard, they should discuss how N-cadherin might affect the binding interactions either allosterically or directly.</p><p>In the analysis of FE mutations, the T146R and E313K mutants shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> are notably shifted in their migration.

However, given the earlier work of Jontes and colleagues on the need for N-cadherin in biologically relevant adhesion, it is not clear whether the homophilic interface described for PDCH19 here has a biological function. The extensive analysis of FE mutations does not provide any insight into this problem, and the effects of many of them on EC folding or Ca<sup>2+</sup> ligation could have been predicted from sequence analysis. To strengthen the case that the homophilic interface is in fact relevant to biological adhesion, the authors need to assess if the loss of adhesion in the homodimer interface mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) is maintained in the presence of the N-cadherin extracellular fragment used in the 2011 paper. Although this would not distinguish whether these affect homophilic adhesion or an allosteric effect of N-cadherin, if adhesion is lost in the mutant in the presence of N-cadherin they would have a strong case for biological relevance of the interface. In this regard, they should discuss how N-cadherin might affect the binding interactions either allosterically or directly.</italic> </p><p>In two previous papers we showed that Protocadherin-19 can interact with N-cadherin, and that N-cadherin can facilitate or enhance Protocadherin-19 interactions <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, we never claimed (nor would we), that this constituted the only “biological adhesion”, in that this is the only circumstance under which Protocadherin-19 functions <italic>in vivo</italic>. For example, N-cadherin interacts in <italic>cis</italic> with many proteins, including the FGF receptor, Nectin and protocadherins, as well as forming <italic>cis</italic>-dimers and mediating adhesion in the absence of these interactions; it wouldn’t be argued that only one of these is biologically relevant. The same is almost certainly true for Protocadherin-19 and other protocadherins. Nevertheless, we have repeated the bead aggregation assays in the presence of N-cadherin and find that mutations in the adhesive interface Pcdh19-I1 still impair aggregation (subsection “Binding Assays Probing Pcdh19 Interfaces”, third paragraph; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). New co-immunoprecipitation experiments also show that mutant protocadherin-19 proteins with impaired adhesion still interact with N-cadherin (in the aforementioned paragraph; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, we now include a negative control. In this control a mutation expected to disrupt a salt-bridge in an alternate crystallographically observed interface does not abolish bead aggregation (in the aforementioned paragraph; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, panels B-D). These additional data, along with results from our original manuscript, suggest that the adhesive interface Pcdh19-I1 of Protocadherin-19 observed in our crystal structure is also the interface used in the presence of N-cadherin. We refrained from speculating about how N-cadherin may affect Protocadherin-19 adhesion (allosterically or directly), as more experiments are needed to fully understand their interaction mode.</p><p><italic>In the analysis of FE mutations, the T146R and E313K mutants shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> are notably shifted in their migration.

The apparent shift in migration is due to “smiling of the gel,” and placement of lanes 2 and 3 (T146R and E313K mutants) next to lane 6 (wild type). We have changed the order of lanes in the revised manuscript figure to avoid confusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). In addition, we have verified that the mutation E313K does not dramatically affect the stability of protocadherin-19 (subsection “PCDH19-FE Mutations Analyzed in the Context of the Pcdh19 EC1-4 Structure”, last paragraph; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18529.027</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18529.027">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18529.027</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-18529-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors performed the requested experiment in which the N-cadherin extracellular domain is added to the bead aggregation assay.

As for the proportion of N- cadherin pulled down, it would be inappropriate to use these assays to get a quantitative evaluation of the Pcdh19 interaction with N-cadherin.
