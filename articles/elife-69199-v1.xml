homologues are transmembrane proteins required for various aspects of neuronal development and activity, whose molecular function is unknown. Specifically, it is unclear whether APP acts as a receptor, and if so what its ligand(s) may be. We show that APP binds the Wnt ligands Wnt3a and Wnt5a and that this binding regulates APP protein levels. Wnt3a binding promotes full-length APP (flAPP) recycling and stability. In contrast, Wnt5a promotes APP targeting to lysosomal compartments and reduces flAPP levels. A conserved Cysteine-Rich Domain (CRD) in the extracellular portion of APP is required for Wnt binding, and deletion of the CRD abrogates the effects of Wnts on flAPP levels and trafficking. Finally, loss of APP results in increased axonal and reduced dendritic growth of mouse embryonic primary cortical neurons. This phenotype can be cell-autonomously rescued by full length, but not CRD-deleted, APP and regulated by Wnt ligands in a CRD-dependent manner.</p></abstract><kwd-group

(APP) is the precursor that generates the Aβ peptide, whose accumulation is associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Selkoe and Hardy, 2016</xref>). As an ancient and highly conserved protein, APP and its homologs are found across animal species in both vertebrates and invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shariati and De Strooper, 2013</xref>). As a result of the alternative splicing of the 18 exons coding for APP, there are three major isoforms expressed in different organs or tissues in mice and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Panegyres and Atkins, 2011</xref>). APP695 is the major isoform expressed in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kang et al., 1987</xref>). The expression of APP is detected at early stage during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ott and Bullock, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sarasa et al., 2000</xref>). In the developing mouse cortex, <italic>App</italic> mRNA is expressed continuously starting at embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) coinciding with the initiation of neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Salbaum and Ruddle, 1994</xref>).</p><p>Structurally, APP is a type I transmembrane protein, which possesses a large extracellular amino acids sequence, an α−helix transmembrane sequence and a relatively short intracellular C-terminal sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Müller and Zheng, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coburger et al., 2013</xref>). Based on the architecture of the ectodomain, APP has been proposed to be a putative receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ninomiya et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pietrzik et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deyts et al., 2016</xref>). APP trafficking and processing have been intensively studied ever since the protein was first cloned. The turnover of transmembrane full-length APP is rapid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hunter and Brayne, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">El Ayadi et al., 2012</xref>), and internalised APP can be degraded in lysosome or processed by α-, β-, and γ-secretase in different subcellular compartments to produce corresponding segments of APP. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haass et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yuksel and Tacal, 2019</xref>). Recently, effort has been put into researching the function of the proteolytic products of APP under normal physiological condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coronel et al., 2018</xref>), as this may provide new clues for AD research.</p><p>During <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain development the fly homolog of APP, called APPL, functions as key component of the neuronal Wnt-PCP signaling pathway and regulates the axonal outgrowth in fly mushroom body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Soldano et al., 2013</xref>). Both mammalian APP and fly APPL contain a Cysteine-Rich Domain (CRD) in the ectodomain of APP whose Cysteine distribution resembles that of the Wnt Tyrosine-protein kinase receptor Ror2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coburger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oishi et al., 2003</xref>), suggesting the intriguing possibility that APP may itself be a receptor for Wnt family member.</p><p>Wnt signaling is an evolutionary conserved signal transduction pathway that regulates a large number of cellular processes. Three Wnt signaling pathway have been well described: the β-catenin-based canonical pathway, the planar cell polarity (PCP/Wnt) signaling pathway and the calcium pathway. Wnt signaling regulates various features during development such as cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eisenmann, 2005</xref>). Recently, increasing evidence indicates that the Wnt signaling pathways are involved in the APP-related Aβ production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sellers et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elliott et al., 2018</xref>), but the precise mode of interaction between APP and the various Wnt pathways remains unclear.</p><p>The presence of CRD in APP, the reported involvement of Wnt signaling in APP processing and the importance of Wnt signaling during development suggested to us that APP may be a novel class of Wnt receptor regulating neuronal development. We used <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse embryonic primary cortical neurons as models to explore the APP-Wnt interactions during development. We provide evidence that the CRD of APP is a conserved binding domain for both canonical and PCP Wnt ligands. Furthermore, APP trafficking and expression is regulated by Wnts through the CRD, which in turn is required for APP to regulate axonal and dendritic growth and branching.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> APP like interacts genetically with Wnt5</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> APPL has been implicated in neural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cassar and Kretzschmar, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nicolas and Hassan, 2014</xref>) and is required for learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Preat and Goguel, 2016</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> APPL is a homologue of human APP and has been used as a model for understanding the physiological function of the APP family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Soldano and Hassan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van der Kant and Goldstein, 2015</xref>). We previously reported that <italic>appl</italic> genetically interacts with components of the Wnt-PCP pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Soldano et al., 2013</xref>) during mushroom body (MB) axon growth. The MBs are a bilateral neuronal structure in the fly brain required for learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heisenberg, 2003</xref>). To understand the role of APPL in axonal PCP signaling, we first explored the specific nature of the genetic interaction between <italic>appl</italic> and the gene encoding the PCP protein Van Gough (Vang). In contrast to control MBs, 17% of male <italic>appl</italic> null mutant flies (<italic>appl</italic><sup>d</sup>/Y, henceforth Appl-/-) displayed a loss of the MBb-lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,A’</xref>). The PCP receptor Vang is also required for β-lobe growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shimizu et al., 2011</xref>); we observed that flies homozygous for the null allele <italic>vang<sup>stbm-6</sup></italic> exhibited 50% β-lobe loss. Whereas <italic>vang<sup>stbm-6</sup></italic> heterozygotes show no MB defects, the loss of one copy of <italic>vang</italic> in Appl-/- flies is comparable (43% β-lobe loss) to the complete loss of <italic>vang</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

We sought to investigate this further at a cell biological level using developing mouse embryonic primary cortical neurons as a model system. APP trafficking and processing have been intensively investigated in studies relating to AD, and according to early reports the half-life of APP is quite short, ranging from 1 hr to 4 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hunter and Brayne, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">El Ayadi et al., 2012</xref>). In mouse embryonic (E16) primary neuron cultures, full-length mouse APP (fl-mAPP; henceforth we refer to mouse APP as mAPP and to human APP as hAPP) expression significantly dropped after 2 hr of treatment with translational inhibitor (Cycloheximide) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting relatively rapid turnover of mAPP. To study the relation between mAPP and Wnts, we first verified that mAPP also binds Wnt5a through its CRD and found that fl-mAPP but not mAPPΔCRD co-IP’s with Wnt5a, similar to APPL and hAPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Next, we used immunofluorescence to localize mAPP with or without Wnt5a treatment in developing cortical neurons during axonal outgrowth (DIV7). mAPP is modified to maturation in the Trans Golgi Network (TGN) to be subsequently transferred to the plasma membrane where it can be internalized into early endosomes. From the early endosome, mAPP is either recycled back to the TGN through retromer-dependent sorting, or to the late endosome and then lysosome to be degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haass et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vagnozzi and Praticò, 2019</xref>). We used markers for early endosomes (Rab5), recycling endosome (Rab11), TGN (Golgin97), and lysosomes (Lamp1) to trace mAPP trafficking after 2 hr and 4 hr Wnt5a treatment. The fraction of mAPP co-localized with early endosomes was not affected after 2 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>) or 4 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>) of Wnt5a treatment. Similarly, we observed no effects on co-localization with recycling endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A,D</xref>) indicating normal initial internalization and recycling of mAPP. However, we found a reduction of mAPP in the TGN, accompanied by an increase of mAPP in lysosomes both after 2 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D,G</xref>) and 4 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,D,E</xref>) of Wnt5a treatment suggesting that Wnt5a regulates intracellular targeting of mAPP after internalization. Importantly, the levels of expression of these markers (Rab5, Golgin97, and Lamp1) are not affected by Wnt5a treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Next, we asked if this altered trafficking affected mAPP levels. We found that the level of fl-mAPP was significantly reduced after 4 hr of Wnt5a treatment, as shown by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>), with no effect on m<italic>App</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). The results of immunofluorescence (IF) and western blot (WB) suggest that the decrease of the mAPP upon Wnt5a treatment is caused by lysosomal degradation. To confirm this, we used Bafilomycin-A in combination with Wnt5a treatment. Bafilomycin-A treatment was performed 1 hr after Wnt5a addition as Wnt5a treatment already affected APP levels after 2 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>)- to inhibit the lysosome and found that this restored mAPP to control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–L</xref>).

Wnt3a is one of the 19 Wnt members in mouse and human. During development, Wnt3a usually induces β-catenin signaling pathway which plays an import role in gene expression, cell proliferation, and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mulligan and Cheyette, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rosso and Inestrosa, 2013</xref>). Recent studies suggest that Wnt3a and beta-Catenin signaling may be involved in AD pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parr et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tapia-Rojas et al., 2016</xref>). More interestingly, studies on mouse AD models showed that Wnt3a and Wnt5a interact competitively and antagonistically with regard to APP-mediated synapse loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sellers et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elliott et al., 2018</xref>). We therefore wondered whether, like Wnt5a, Wnt3a also binds to mAPP through the conserved CRD and regulates its levels. To test this, we performed IP experiments with Wnt3a. We found that fl-mAPP and Wnt3a co-IP in a CRD-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We next tested the effects of Wnt3a treatment on APP trafficking. As shown in and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2(A)</xref>, The fraction of mAPP co-localized with early endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>) and recycling endosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A,D</xref>) was not affected after 2 hr and 4 hr of Wnt3a treatment. However, more mAPP was present in the TGN, with no effect on the lysosomal mAPP fraction after 2 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D,G</xref>) and 4 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–E</xref>) of Wnt3a treatment. The expression levels of Rab5, Golgin97 and Lamp1 were not affected after Wnt3a treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Western blot analysis showed increased fl-mAPP upon Wnt3a treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref>), but no effect on mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). There is evidence that mAPP is recycled back to the TGN from early endosomes through the retrograde pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vagnozzi and Praticò, 2019</xref>). To test whether Wnt3a regulates mAPP retro trafficking to the TGN, we co-treated primary neurons with Wnt3a and a retromer inhibitor (LY294002), retromer inhibitor treatment was performed 1 hr after Wnt3a addition as Wnt3a treatment could affected APP protein expression clearly 2 hr later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). This reversed the effect of Wnt3a on mAPP trafficking protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I–L</xref>). Then, we tested the effects of simultaneous treatment with Wnt3a and Wnt5a. This resulted in no change to APP protein levels compared to controls, suggesting that Wnt3a and Wnt5a neutralize each other’s effects on mAPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M,N</xref>), again with no effects on mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4O</xref>).

In contrast, dendritic outgrowth was not different from controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). We asked whether the CRD was required for mAPP function during neurite outgrowth. To this end, we transfected mAPP knockout neurons with either fl-mAPP or mAPPΔCRD. Increased axonal length and axonal branch tips were rescued by the fl-mAPP but not by the form lacking the CRD at DIV3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–E</xref>).

To address this question, we analyzed neurite outgrowth in APP-KO primary cortical neurons rescued with APP-WT or APP-ΔCRD plasmids after Wnt3a/5a treatment. On DIV3 Wnt3a treatment significantly increased total axon length, the length of longest axon and axon branch tips in the presence of fl-APP but not APP-Δ-CRD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B,C</xref>). These data suggest that APP mediates Wnt3a effects on axonal outgrowth. In contrast to Wnt3a, Wnt5a treatment had no effect in the presence of fl-APP but resulted in increased axonal length when the CRD domain was removed. These data show that APP normally protects axons from the effects of Wnt5a at this developmental stage and that the CRD is required for this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Thus, APP promotes Wnt3a and antagonizes Wnt5a effects on neurons at DIV3 via the CRD domain. Similarly, on DIV7 we found a positive Wnt3a effect on axon complexity which was observed in the presence of fl-APP but not APP-Δ-CRD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). In contrast Wnt5a had no effect. Finally, we found that treatment with either Wnt3a or Wnt5a decreases the number of the main dendrites in the presence of fl-APP and the effect is absent or even reversed in the presence of APP-Δ-CRD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Together, these data show that the CRD of APP is required for Wnt3a/5a to regulate neurite outgrowth in cortical primary neurons.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Neurite outgrowth analysis at DIV3 and DIV7 after Wnts treatment.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Quantification of total axon length (<bold>A</bold>), the longest axon length (<bold>B</bold>), and axon branch tips (<bold>C</bold>) from DIV3 cultured APP-KO primary cortical neuron after Wnts treatment rescued with APP-WT or APP-ΔCRD, respectively.

We show that APP binds both canonical and non-canonical Wnt ligands via a conserved CRD and that this binding regulates the levels of full-length APP by regulating its intracellular trafficking from early endosomes to the trans Golgi network versus the lysosome. Finally, we show that APP through the CRD regulates neurite growth and axon branching complexity in primary mouse cortical neurons.</p><p>A function for APP as a cell surface receptor has be proposed for quite a long time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kang et al., 1987</xref>). The first strong evidence came from the structure of APP which shares similarity with type I transmembrane receptors. For example the growth factor like domain (GFLD) in the E1 region of APP could act as a ligand-binding site, and disulfide bridges within the same E1 area could further facilitate ligand-induced signal transduction by stabilizing the structure of APP ectodomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reinhard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rossjohn et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stahl et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaden et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, the site-specific proteolytic processing property of APP resembles several membrane receptors and constitute a second line of evidence. For instance, both APP and Notch are processed by γ-secretase and release the intracellular domain AICD and NICD, respectively, to induce transcriptional activity by nuclear transfer of the ICDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ables et al., 2011</xref>). Several putative ligands have been proposed including proteolytic products of APP itself. Interestingly, a conserved CRD within the E1 region of APP makes APP a putative Wnt receptor as the CRD is required for the binding between Wnt and its receptor and co-receptor like Frizzled Ror-2 and Musk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Niehrs, 2012</xref>), although the crystal structure of the APP CRD is different from that of classic Wnt receptors. In this study, using immunoprecipitation we have shown that mouse APP binds in a CRD-dependent manner to Wnt3a and Wnt5a the two well-known ligands for triggering canonical or non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways, respectively. Based on these data, we speculate that APP might act as a conserved Wnt receptor as its CRD is highly conserved across species, and that the binding may not be limited to Wnt3a or Wnt5a, but also apply to all other Wnt family members. As Wnt signaling is critical for development and tissue homeostasis, the role of APP as a component or putative receptor or co-receptor in Wnt signaling should be carefully studied. The difficulty to explore the exact role of APP may not only come from the complexity of Wnt signaling, but also from the structural properties of APP itself. For example, the extracellular domain of APP harbors several binding site for the molecules in the extracellular matrix (ECM), such as the Heparin binding domain (HBD) is not only exist in E1 area a second HBD has been found in the E2 region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deyts et al., 2016</xref>). A recent study has shown that LRP6, the co-receptor of canonical Wnt signaling, could directly bind to APP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elliott et al., 2018</xref>). Using peptide Mapping array this group further revealed several binding sites (20–70 amino acids in length) in the ectodomain of APP, and one of the sites (34 amino acids) is located within the APP CRD. Based on our IP results indicating a Wnt receptor function for APP, an obvious question arises as to whether LRP6 and APP compete for Wnt. Before trying to address this problem, several issues need to be resolved. First, as in our IP experiments the whole CRD (150 amino acids) was deleted it is not clear if specific sequences inside the CRD are critical for Wnt binding that may or may not overlap with the reported LRP6-binding site. A second important point is that the results of the peptide mapping array may not reflect the exact binging site for LRP6 as these short synthesized peptides may lack information embedded in the 3D structure like the disulfide bridges formed by Cysteines that may be critical for maintaining the stability of the APP extracellular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rossjohn et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stahl et al., 2014</xref>). Significant further biophysical and biochemical analysis is required to understand the details of the interaction and various components of the Wnt receptor complex.</p><p>APP has been extensively reported to be involved in regulating neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Billnitzer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Young-Pearse et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araki et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Southam et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Small et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Perez et al., 1997</xref>), with conflicting conclusions as to whether APP promotes or inhibits neurite outgrowth. In our experiments, we found that while in <italic>Drosophila</italic> APPL loss reduced axonal growth, the comparison of axonal outgrowth and branching in primary cortical neuron derived from mAPP wild type or mAPP knock out mice at DIV2, DIV3 and DIV7 showed that loss of mAPP significantly accelerated axonal maturation. Specifically, we found that the initial phase of axonal growth at DIV2 is unaffected, but that APP mutant axons grow longer at DIV3 and then show increased axon complexity at DIV7. We therefore suggest that the conflicting data in the literature may arise from examining different types of neurons at different time points, where the requirement of APP may differ in a context-specific manner. We speculate that this context specificity may in part be due to the levels and types of Wnt ligands present in the environment.</p><p>Finally, our findings suggest that in addition to the well-described proteolytic processing of APP, the regulation of its recycling by Wnt ligands may be crucial for its function. It is important to note that, like proteolytic processing, Wnt ligands regulate APP stability post-translationally, as we found no effect on <italic>App</italic> mRNA levels upon Wnt treatment. With regard to the role of APP processing in Alzheimer’s disease, recently published work suggests that an imbalance between Wnt3a/canonical signaling pathway and the Wnt5a/PCP signaling pathway at the initial step of amyloid beta production could trigger a vicious cycle favoring the amyloidogenic processing of APP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sellers et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elliott et al., 2018</xref>). Our findings that Wnt3a and Wnt5a have opposite effects on amyloid beta production provide a mechanistic framework for understanding how the normal physiological function of APP directly impacts the generation of a key marker of AD, and thus potentially links the normal activity of APP to its role in neurodegeneration. Whether and how the modulation of APP’s role in Wnt signaling may offer future therapeutic avenues for AD is an exciting venue for future research.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

To generate transgenic flies, open-reading frames with epitope tags were cloned into the pUAST-attB fly expression vector and transgenes were inserted into the genome at the VK37 docking site (2L, 22A3) via PhiC31-mediated transgenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Mushroom body analyses</title><p>Adult fly brains were dissected in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBT (PBS+ 0.1% Triton100-X) for 15 min. Then, the brains were washed three times in PBT and blocked in PAX-DG for 1 hr at RT. The samples were later incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4°C. After incubation, the brains were washed three times with PBT and incubated with an ALEXA Fluor secondary antibodies (Life technologies) for 2 hr at RT. After three times washes in PBT, the brains were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Labs, USA) mounting medium. The following antibodies were used: mouse anti-FasII (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB), 1/50), rabbit anti-GFP (Invitrogen, 1/500). The mounted brains were imaged on a LEICA DM 6000 CS microscope coupled to a LEICA CTR 6500 confocal system and a Nikon A1-R confocal (Nikon) mounted on a Nikon inverted microscope (Nikon).

summary:</bold></p><p>Your manuscript documents interactions between APP and Wnt ligands. Interestingly, both the canonical Wnt ligand Wnt3a and noncanonical Wnt ligand Wnt5a are able to bind to a conserved Cysteine Rich Domain (CRD) in the extracellular portion of APP, Your work provides compelling evidence that the CRD is critical for APP to regulate proper neurite outgrowth and neurite complexity. Moreover, your data indicate that Wnt3a binds to APP and promotes APP recycling and stability. In contrast, Wnt5a binds to APP and negatively affects APP stability. Overall, this study is novel and will generate interest in the fly and AD community..</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69199.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1</p><p>Evidence, reproducibility and clarity:</p><p>In this manuscript, Liu et al. studied the interactions between APP and Wnt ligands. It was found that both canonical Wnt ligand Wnt3a and noncanonical Wnt ligand Wnt5a are able to bind to the conserved Cysteine Rich Domain (CRD) in the extracellular portion of APP, and that the CRD is critical for APP to regulate neurite outgrowth and complexity. While Wnt3a binds to APP and promotes APP recycling and stability, Wnt5a binds to APP and exhibits an opposite effect on APP stability. Overall, the study is novel and interesting.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive comments on the novelty and interest of the work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments:</p><p>While the findings and conclusions in this manuscript are solid, the authors should perform additional experiments to characterize the interactions between Wnt ligands and APP and determine subsequent effects on Wnt signaling and Aβ production.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive comments on the strength of the evidence and address their specific comets below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. It is unclear whether Wnt3a and Wnt5a have the same binding site or different binding sites within the CRD of APP, and whether Wnt3a and Wnt5a compete with one another for binding.</p></disp-quote><p>We note that our data suggest that Wnt3a and Wnt5a do compete for APP binding. This is because while Wnt3a increases APP levels and Wnt5a decreases it, treatment with both ligands at the same time restores APP protein back to control levels. Furthermore, CRD domain folding is thought to require disulfide bonds between the Cysteine residues, and it is therefore quite unlikely that further dissection of the CRD will yield meaningful results Generally, while we agree that determining the precise biochemical properties required for APP-Wnt interactions is interesting, we believe that going into such level of detail is beyond the scope of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It is unclear whether the interactions between Wnt ligands and APP modulate Wnt signaling.

We have now performed IF and WB with β-catenin, Dvll and Dvl2 antibodies. Unfortunately, only the Β-catenin antibody worked in WB experiments on primary neurons. We find that Wnt3a treatment increases levels of β-Catenin in control but not APP-KO primary neurons, consistent with previous findings in cell lines that APP enhances canonical Wnt signaling.

It has been demonstrated that canonical Wnt signaling inhibits neurite outgrowth. In Figure 6, it was shown that mAPP knockout neurons exhibited increased axonal outgrowth, which was rescued by the fl-mAPP but not by the form lacking the CRD at DIV3. Therefore, the authors should determine whether the APP effect on neurite outgrowth is associated with an activation of canonical Wnt signaling. Specifically, does the fl-mAPP facilitate activation of canonical Wnt signaling in neurons? If yes, does the APP lacking the CRD lost its ability on canonical Wnt signaling?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion to disentangle the effects of each of the two pathways on APP-mediated neurite outgrowth. To address this issue we treated neurons expressing either fl-APP or APP-Δ-CRD with Wnt3a or Wnt5a and measured the effect on APP-dependent axon and dendrite growth on DIV3 and DIV7.</p><p>On DIV 3 we found that at DIV3 Wnt3a treatment significantly significant increased total axon length, the length of longest axon and axon branch tips in the presence of fl-APP but not APP-Δ-CRD (revision Figure 2 A, B, C). These data suggest that APP mediates Wnt3a effects on axonal outgrowth. In contrast to Wnt3a, Wnt5a treatment had no effect in the presence of fl-APP but resulted in increased axonal length when the CRD domain was removed. These data show that APP normally protects axons from the effects of Wnt5a at this developmental stage and that the CRD is also required for this. Thus, APP promotes Wnt3a and antagonizes Wnt5a effects on neurons at DIV 3 via the CRD domain.</p><p>Similarly, on DIV7 we found a positive Wnt3a effect on axon complexity which was observed in the presence of fl-APP but not APP-Δ-CRD. In contrast Wnt5a had no effect. Finally, we found that treatment with either Wnt3a or Wnt5a decreases the number of the main dendrites in the presence of fl-APP and the effect is absent or even reversed in the presence of APP-Δ-CRD.</p><p>Together, these data show that the CRD of APP is required for Wnt3a/5a to regulate neurite outgrowth in cortical primary neurons. We will add these data to the revised manuscript.</p><p>These data are now presented in Figure 8 and on pages 11-12 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It is unclear whether the interactions between Wnt ligands and APP modulate Aβ production, and whether Wnt3a and Wnt5a have different effects on Aβ production after their binding to the CRD of APP.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tested Aβ40 and Aβ 42 production in primary cortical neurons after 4 hours treatment of Wnt3a or Wnt5a at DIV7.

Our data shows that a 4-hour Wnt3a/5a treatment has a long-lasting effect on Aβ40/42 production and that those effects are antagonistic. Consistent with Wnt3a favoring recycling of APP we found that Wnt3a treatment significantly decrease Aβ40/42 production. In contrast, Wnt5a treatment, which indices APP internalization into acidic compartments, resulted in an increase in Aβ40/42 producing.

Therefore, the study on the interactions between APP and Wnt ligands is significant, and the finding of Wnt ligand-binding to APP described in this manuscript is novel and interesting. However, in Figure 3F and Figure 4F, the concentrations of Wnt5a and Wnt3a were 400 ng/ml and 150 ng/ml, respectively, for modulating APP level/stability in DIV7 primary cortical neurons. These are quite high concentrations and difficult to be reached at pathophysiological conditions (particularly for Wnt5a).

In this manuscript, Authors have found that Wnt3a and Wnt5a bind to cysteine rich domain (CRD) of APP and differently regulates APP trafficking and levels, which influence axonal and dendritic growth of neurons. Although their finding is potentially important, they lack the impact because the links between APP and Wnt pathways have been reported.

We note that both reviewers 1 and 2 described the work as significant and novel. While we agree that a link between APP and Wnt signaling has been described, and our group was one of the first to demonstrate this in vivo, we stress that the exact nature of this link has remained entirely unclear. Showing that APP directly interacts with Wnts ligands and examining why those ligands might have antagonistic effects on APP-dependent processes is a very significant step forward in providing a clear link between the physiological function of APP at the molecular and cellular levels and its potential role in AD. The lack of this link has hitherto been a source of major controversy in the field as to whether APP’s physiological function had any relevance to AD at all. Our data, as well as new experiments we performed provide very strong evidence that this is the case.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major Concerns:</p><p>1.

There are many receptors and co-receptors for Wnts, including many members of the Frizzled and LRP families as well DRKs and Vang family members and so on. Studying how each of those responds to Wnt treatment in primary cortical neurons and whether that is correlated to APP dynamics is in and of itself an entire study that requires first establishing whether these receptors are expressed in these neurons, how they are normally localized and then if and how they interact with APP in the presence of absence of APP with or without the CRD domain. This would be very interesting as a future research avenue.
