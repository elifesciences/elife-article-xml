of the <italic>MYC</italic> oncogene on chromosome 8q24 contains susceptibility loci for several major forms of human cancer. The region shows high conservation between human and mouse and contains multiple <italic>MYC</italic> enhancers that are activated in tumor cells. However, the role of this region in normal development has not been addressed. Here we show that a 538 kb deletion of the entire <italic>MYC</italic> upstream super-enhancer region in mice results in 50% to 80% decrease in <italic>Myc</italic> expression in multiple tissues. The mice are viable and show no overt phenotype. However, they are resistant to tumorigenesis, and most normal cells isolated from them grow slowly in culture. These results reveal that only cells whose MYC activity is increased by serum or oncogenic driver mutations depend on the 8q24 super-enhancer region, and indicate that targeting the activity of this element is a promising strategy of cancer chemoprevention and therapy.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23382.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23382.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23382.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our cells each contain close to 20,000 genes, which provide the instructions needed to build our bodies and keep us alive. At any one time in the life of the cell, only some of these genes are active. The activity of each gene is constantly regulated to allow the cell to respond to changes in its environment. Enhancers are sections of DNA, outside of the genes, that act as molecular switches controlling the activity of genes. A gene can have many such enhancers; each enhancer is linked to a particular set of signals and having multiple enhancers allows the same gene to be activated by different signals in different tissues in the body.</p><p>Changes to enhancers can have serious consequences. By altering the activity of genes, an enhancer can have widespread effects on the health and behavior of a cell, including transforming it from healthy to cancerous. The small differences in enhancers also make some people more susceptible to cancers than others. If we can identify enhancers whose activity is commonly altered in cancers, it could be possible to target them through treatment. Yet, it is not clear whether targeting enhancers in this way could be effectively used to treat cancer without damaging healthy cells.</p><p>Now, Dave, Sur et al. have examined a large enhancer region with known links to several different cancers – including prostate, breast and colon cancers – to uncover whether it also plays a critical role in healthy cells and if it could be safely targeted for treatment. The region has multiple enhancers for a cancer-linked gene called <italic>MYC</italic> and is implicated in many cancer-associated deaths every year. This particular enhancer region is found in both humans and mice, which share many genes in common. Using genetic engineering, Dave, Sur et al. removed this enhancer region from the genetic information of a group of mice. The experiment showed that mice without the enhancer region were completely healthy. Also, when tested for cancer development, these mice were much less susceptible to several major types of cancer.</p><p>This investigation reveals that it may be possible to create drugs to shut down or inhibit certain enhancers to prevent or treat cancer without damaging healthy cells. However, this is currently just one example in mice under laboratory conditions. Further research is needed to determine if a similar approach can be developed to treat patients in the clinic.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23382.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23382.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>oncogene regulation</kwd><kwd>enhancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAW 2013.0088</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taipale</surname><given-names>Jussi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Center for Innovative Medicine at Karolinska Institutet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taipale</surname><given-names>Jussi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>EU FP7 collaborative project SYSCOL</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HEALTH-F5-2010-258236</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taipale</surname><given-names>Jussi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Identification of tumor-specific regulatory region upstream of the Myc oncogene.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Deregulated expression of the <italic>MYC</italic> oncogene is associated with many cancer types (Reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albihn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Evan, 2012</xref>). MYC acts primarily as a transcriptional activator that increases expression of many genes required for RNA and protein synthesis above the level that is required in resting cells. In cancer cells, aberrantly elevated levels of MYC drive global amplification of transcription rates, providing the cells with necessary resources for rapid proliferation (see, for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van Riggelen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ji et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sabò et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Walz et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Transcription of the <italic>MYC</italic> gene is regulated by a diverse array of regulatory elements located both upstream and downstream of the <italic>MYC</italic> transcription start site (TSS). Variants in the <italic>MYC</italic> upstream region contribute to inherited susceptibility to most major forms of human cancer, and account for a very large number of cancer cases at the population level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amundadottir et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gudmundsson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yeager et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al Olama et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yeager et al., 2009</xref>). For example, the polymorphism rs6983267 linked to colorectal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tomlinson et al., 2007</xref>) and prostate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yeager et al., 2007</xref>) cancers contributes more to cancer morbidity and mortality than any other known inherited variant or mutation, including the inherited mutations in classic tumor suppressors such as <italic>RB</italic>, <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>APC</italic>. Through computational and experimental analyses, we and others have shown that the risk allele G of rs6983267 creates a strong binding site for the colorectal-cancer associated transcription factor Tcf7l2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pomerantz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tuupanen et al., 2009</xref>). This binding site is located within the <italic>Myc-335</italic> enhancer element that is dispensable for mouse viability, but required for efficient Tcf7l2-driven intestinal tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sur et al., 2012b</xref>).</p><p>More recently, another enhancer element, located 1.47 Mb downstream of <italic>Myc</italic> was shown to be required for formation of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herranz et al., 2014</xref>). However, in contrast to the <italic>Myc-335</italic> element, this element is also required for normal T-cell development. Thus, the mechanism by which individual <italic>Myc</italic> enhancer elements contribute to normal development and tumorigenesis is still unclear.</p><p>Several studies have shown that the 8q24 region contains a large number of additional enhancer elements (see, for example [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hallikas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmadiyeh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yao et al., 2014</xref>]) and super-enhancers that are active in many different types of human cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hnisz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lovén et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). The <italic>MYC</italic>-associated super-enhancers are activated during the process of tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hnisz et al., 2013</xref>), and downregulation of super-enhancer activity leads to selective inhibition of <italic>MYC</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lovén et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, <italic>MYC</italic>-associated super-enhancer activity is required for tumorigenesis, but the role of these elements in normal tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis has been unclear.</p><p>To address this problem, we have in this work generated multiple mouse strains deficient of regulatory elements upstream of the <italic>Myc</italic> promoter. Since this region contains multiple tumor type and tissue -specific enhancers and super-enhancers, for the sake of clarity we refer to the deleted region here as the `super-enhancer region´. By analysis of the mice, we found that the entire super-enhancer region conferring multi-cancer susceptibility contributes to MYC expression <italic>in vivo</italic>, yet is not required for mouse embryonic development and viability. However, this region is required for the growth of normal cells in culture and cancer cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. As cultured cells are exposed to serum, which is a signal of tissue damage, this finding suggests that tumor cells and cells responding to damage signals share regulatory mechanisms that are dispensable for normal physiological growth control.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Functional mapping of the super-enhancer region upstream of <italic>Myc</italic></title><p>To dissect functional significance of the 8q24 region during normal development, we generated series of <italic>Myc</italic> alleles in mice using homologous recombination in ES cells.

On aggregate, this region contributes more to inherited cancer than any other locus in the human genome. The risk alleles for different cancer types are located in multiple distinct linkage disequilibrium blocks, indicating that different variants contribute to different cancer types. Several of these regions containing risk variants have been implicated in regulation of MYC expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hallikas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sur et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herranz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Uslu et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that a large number of enhancers within this region can drive tumorigenesis. Some of the identified elements have also been shown to have roles in normal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herranz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Uslu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To study the role of the 8q24 region more systematically, we have in this work deleted several individual enhancer elements, and also analyzed the effect of larger deletions on normal development and carcinogenesis in mice. Our analysis of mice lacking a 538 kb region upstream of the <italic>Myc</italic> gene suggests that enhancer elements within this region cooperatively enhance <italic>Myc</italic> expression. Deletion of individual enhancers in this region has only a weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sur et al., 2012b</xref>) or no effect on <italic>Myc</italic> expression in the mouse intestine in contrast to the deletion of the entire super-enhancer region, which leads to severe decrease in <italic>Myc</italic> expression in multiple tissues.</p><p>MYC deficient mouse embryos die due to placental defect at E9.5. The embryos are also smaller in size than wild-type embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davis et al., 1993</xref>). However, when <italic>Myc</italic> is deleted only in the epiblast, the embryos grow normally and survive until E11.5, when they die due to defects in hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dubois et al., 2008</xref>). None of these defects are observed in mice homozygous for the deletion of super-enhancer region. The 8q24 super-enhancer region is thus dispensable for MYC function both in the placenta and during early hematopoiesis. In our mouse colony, the super-enhancer region deficient mice also do not display the size or weight differences reported for <italic>Myc</italic> heterozygous mice that have a 50% reduction in MYC activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Trumpp et al., 2001</xref>). These results indicate that tissue-specific enhancers that reside outside of the deleted regions drive sufficient MYC expression in the tissues that contribute to the phenotypes observed in <italic>Myc<sup>+/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Myc<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice. Consistently with this, several hematopoietic enhancers have been identified in the region 3' of the <italic>MYC</italic> ORF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hnisz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herranz et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p><italic>Myc</italic> heterozygous mice also display increased longevity and enhanced healthspan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hofmann et al., 2015</xref>). Although the deletion of the super-enhancer region that contains tissue-specific enhancers regulating MYC expression is not equivalent to a heterozygous deletion of the <italic>Myc</italic> gene in the whole body, the <italic>Myc<sup>△2–540/△2–540</sup></italic> mice could be an interesting model for identification of the tissues that contribute to the longevity phenotype.</p><p>Despite decreased levels of MYC in multiple adult tissues, the mice lacking the super-enhancer region are viable, fertile and display normal tissue morphology in all the tissues we investigated. They display no overt phenotype and do not have marked defects in cell proliferation. The mice are, however, resistant to intestinal tumorigenesis, and DMBA-induced mammary tumors, indicating that this region is important for tumorigenesis also in mice. Our data thus shows that despite the central role of this region in tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sur et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lovén et al., 2013</xref>), it is dispensable for normal tissue development and homeostasis under laboratory conditions. Whereas this result may appear very surprising, it is consistent with the original identification of this region using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). GWAS has a high power to identify common variants, and most variants that are common have only a limited effect on physiological functions. This is because a variant that has strong positive or negative effect is rapidly fixed or lost, respectively. Thus, GWAS are specifically biased to find variants that have a relatively large effect on disease, but a small effect on fitness.</p><p>Most genes in mammals do not have haploinsufficient phenotypes. Such buffering could be due to mechanisms that maintain constant expression level irrespective of gene dose. However, a simpler buffering mechanism involves either expressing a gene at a very low level where it has no effect, or at a high level where it can contribute its functions even if its expression level is decreased due to transcriptional noise or loss-of-function of one allele. A similar two state mechanism where physiological transcription factor (TF) activity levels in the relevant cell types are either too low to drive any target genes (off state), or high enough to activate all important targets (on state) could also mechanistically explain why most heterozygous null mutations of TF genes have no apparent phenotype. Our analysis of the role of MYC in normal colon is consistent with such a simple buffering model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, it should be noted that this buffering mechanism does not operate in all tissues and under all conditions. For example, <italic>Myc</italic> gene dose has effects on mouse size, longevity and hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davis et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Trumpp et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dubois et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hofmann et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, the level of expression of the <italic>Myc</italic> gene has quantitative effects on cell proliferation under pathological conditions such as activation of T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heinzel et al., 2017</xref>). These results indicate that in some situations, MYC is expressed at a level where cell growth responds linearly to small changes in MYC levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, middle panel). However, the lack of an overt phenotype in our model under normal physiological conditions in the absence of infection or tissue damage suggests that growth during normal tissue homeostasis in at least some adult tissues does not linearly respond to changes in MYC levels. The lack of an overt phenotype should not, however, be taken to mean that the mice have no phenotype at all. As the super-enhancer region contains several highly conserved DNA segments, and affects cell growth in culture, we expect that it will also affect responses to tissue damage or some other perturbation that we have not investigated here. Therefore, further studies are needed to determine the role of the super-enhancer region in various chronic and acute models of injury and infection.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23382.017</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model showing the activity of the <italic>Myc</italic> super-enhancer region during normal homeostasis (left) and cancer (right).</title><p>During normal tissue homeostasis (left), <italic>Myc</italic> enhancers are not strongly active, and MYC activity is relatively low. The MYC expression level is insufficient to recruit enough MAX proteins to MYC/MAX heterodimers to drive strong induction of the MYC target genes, which instead remain under the control of basal transcription factors (BTF). Under conditions of normal rapid proliferation as seen during embryonic development or during pathological insults in the adult, MYC is expressed at intermediate levels to elicit response from targets with high affinity binding sites (red). In cancer cells or cells grown in culture (right), upstream regulators such as Tcf7l2 and β-catenin activate the <italic>Myc</italic> super-enhancers, driving high levels of MYC expression. This leads to the formation of MYC/MAX heterodimers that strongly activate transcription of MYC target genes driving cancer cell growth. The high levels of MYC are also sufficient to induce target genes that harbor low affinity MYC binding sites (grey). The model is consistent with the model of Lorenzin <italic>et al</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lorenzin et al., 2016</xref>) who showed genes differ in their response to MYC levels due to differences in the MYC affinity of their promoters.

The target genes are thus only sensitive to an increase in MYC levels. Consistently, an 80% decrease of <italic>Myc</italic> mRNA expression does not lead to a proliferation defect, or major changes in expression of known MYC target genes. In contrast, in tumors the system is locked to an on state, where MYC targets are driven to a maximal level by MYC, and the targets are now only sensitive to a decrease in MYC activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>The requirement of MYC in tumor cells appears absolute. In transgenic animal models, overexpression of MYC leads to deregulated proliferation and tumor development in multiple tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Felsher and Bishop, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pelengaris et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">D'Cruz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jain et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shachaf et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, inhibition of MYC almost invariably causes growth arrest of cancer cells both in culture and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Soucek et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hart et al., 2014</xref>). Despite the importance of MYC for cancer growth, it appears that the role of MYC in controlling growth during adult tissue homeostasis is limited. In the adult tissues, MYC is expressed in rapidly proliferating compartments of the body like the intestinal crypts and skin. Deletion of <italic>Myc</italic> in these compartments does not result in prominent proliferation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wilson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baena et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bettess et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Muncan et al., 2006</xref>). Although there is still controversy regarding MYC requirement for the intestinal homeostasis, in the skin MYC is dispensable under normal adult proliferation and homeostasis <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oskarsson et al., 2006</xref>). It is however required for Ras mediated tumorigenesis and growth of fibroblasts and keratinocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mateyak et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oskarsson et al., 2006</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that MYC is required for pathological proliferation, but is less important and in many cases dispensable for normal homeostasis of tissues in the adult. Our results are consistent with these observations.</p><p>Prior to our study it was not clear whether the MYC dependence of cancer cells <italic>in vivo</italic> and normal cells in culture is due to shared regulatory mechanisms. Our results have uncovered striking mechanistic similarities between growth of normal cells in culture, and growth of cancer cells <italic>in vivo</italic> by showing that MYC expression depend on the same genetic elements in cultured normal cells and in cancer cells. The similarity between tumor cells and cultured normal cells also suggest that many potential drugs that block cancer cell growth may have been inadvertently discarded due to their negative effects on growth of normal cells in culture, even when they might not have affected normal tissue homeostasis<italic> in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Our results show that the MYC super-enhancer region that carries multi-cancer susceptibility in humans contributes to the formation of multiple tumor types also in mice. Despite its role in tumor formation, it is dispensable for normal development and homeostasis. Loss of the super-enhancer region leads to low MYC expression, but the lowered expression does not translate to changes in expression of MYC target genes in the intestine. Thus, the MYC/MAX/MNT system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grandori et al., 2000</xref>) that drives cell growth and proliferation is robustly set to an off state during normal homeostasis, whereas in cancer, the system is locked to a pathological on state. This also explains how physiological growth control can be robust to small perturbations and transcriptional noise. Taken together, our results reveal an important difference between the transcriptional states of normal and cancer cells, and suggest that therapeutic interventions that decrease the activity of the <italic>Myc</italic> super-enhancer region would be well tolerated.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse strains</title><p>We generated cKO <italic>Myc-196</italic> and cKO <italic>Myc-540</italic> strains with loxP sites flanking the regions chr15:61445326–61447611 and chr15:61789274–61791107, respectively (Taconic).

Raw sequencing reads were quality and adapter trimmed with cutadapt version 1.8.1 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_011841">SCR_011841</ext-link>) in Trim Galore version 0.4.0 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_011847">SCR_011847</ext-link>). Trimming of low-quality ends was done using Phred score cutoff 30. In addition, all reads were trimmed by 2 bp from their 3' end. Adapter trimming was performed using the first 13 bp of the standard Illumina paired-end adapters with stringency overlap two and error rate 0.1. Read alignment was performed against mouse genome mm9 with Bismark (version v0.14.3; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_005604">SCR_005604</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krueger and Andrews, 2011</xref>) and Bowtie 2 (version 2.2.4; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_005476">SCR_005476</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>). Duplicates were removed using the Bismark deduplicate function. Extraction of methylation calls was done with Bismark methylation extractor discarding first 10 bp of both reads and reading methylation calls of overlapping parts of the paired reads from the first read (--no_overlap parameter). Genomic sites with the coverage of at least 10 reads were considered and methylation ratios smoothed with loess method across 49 bp windows.</p><p>All sequencing data is uploaded to European Nucleotide Archive (ENA, EMBL-EBI; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_006515">SCR_006515</ext-link>) under accession number PRJEB11397 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dave et al., 2016</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB11397">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB11397</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry</title><p>Five micron paraffin embedded tissue sections were processed for immuno-histochemistry as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sur et al., 2012b</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Sean Morrison (Senior Editor) and two reviewers, one of whom, Chi Van Dang, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have significant concerns about your current manuscript, discussed the reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare your responses to determine whether a formal revised submission will be invited.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Dave et al. reports the effect of deleting 538kb enhancer (termed &quot;super-enhancer) region upstream of murine Myc on development and tumorigenesis. This region contains susceptibility loci with several SNPs previously correlated with increased risk for human prostate and colorectal cancer. The authors had previously shown that alteration of the risk allele G of rs6983267 in a mouse model modifies risk for intestinal tumorigenesis, but did not affect viability. Multiple risk alleles have been identified in the enhancer (super-enhancer) region, and the authors addressed the consequence of deleting this region on normal mouse development. They document that deletion of a 538kb region reduced normal <italic>Myc</italic> expression by up to 80% and yet mutant mice were viable without overt phenotype. Importantly, tumorigenesis (e.g., DMBA-induced mammary tumors) is severely diminished in this mutant background, and cells isolated from these mice have slowed growth. Overall, this manuscript contains instructive observations about the regulation of <italic>Myc</italic> expression, physiology and pathophysiological expression of <italic>Myc</italic> for tumorigenesis, underscoring the role of deregulated MYC expression in human cancers.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors construed from these observations that &quot;the MYC/MAX/MNT system that drives cell growth and proliferation is robustly set to an off state in normal homeostasis, whereas in cancer, the system is locked into a pathological on state.&quot; This statement in the last paragraph of the Discussion section is not supported by the evidence, given that the authors have not fully studied normal cellular physiology. <italic>Myc</italic> expression under normal physiological conditions could vary according to signaling and hence the concept of an 'on versus off' state seems over-simplified. For example, Heinzel et al. (Nature Immunol 18:96-104 (2017); see reference 17 below) demonstrated that <italic>Myc</italic> expression dose effect is influenced by input signals into T cell activation. In this regard, the authors should document whether normal T cell activation is altered in the mutant <italic>Myc</italic> animals.</p><p>2) The <italic>Myc</italic> heterozygotes (Sedivy and coworkers: Hofmann et al. Cell 2015) have increased longevity. It stands to reason that the <italic>Myc</italic> super-enhancer mutant may also have increased longevity due to decreased <italic>Myc</italic> expression. In this regard, the manuscript could be further enriched by examining whether mTOR signaling is decreased in the super-enhancer <italic>Myc</italic> mutant tissues or cells.</p><p>3) The authors build upon their previous work in which they showed elegantly that a 1.7 kb region containing a SNP in a TCF binding site 335 kb upstream of the MYC TSS is associated with slightly higher levels of <italic>Myc</italic>, and that these slightly higher <italic>Myc</italic> levels considerably enhance tumorigenesis. The reduced susceptibility to tumorigenesis of the 2-540 deletion is an interesting observation, but it would be nice to include some sort of assurance that the effects are not mediated solely through the 335 region that has already been reported and characterized by the authors (and others) and shown confer resistance to tumor formation when deleted in <italic>Apc<sup>min</sup></italic> mice. Are DMBA/MPA induced mammary tumors influenced by the 335-region deletion or are separate segments of the 2-540 region involved?</p><p>4) The authors are a bit loose with the term super-enhancer (1, 2). The labeling and characterization of the 2-540 kb deleted region as a super-enhancer, especially under physiological conditions is quite questionable. All of the literature on <italic>Myc</italic> and its surrounding gene desert indicates that super-enhancer commissioning seems to be a pathological and not physiological event, often associated with translocations that juxtapose super-enhancers from far-distant regions, usually on other chromosomes (3-5). It seems to be a bit premature to define 0.5 megabases as a super-enhancer. This is quite large, even for a super-enhancer and the authors have performed no functional experiments or computational analysis to discriminate this region as a super-enhancer versus a collection of typical enhancers that each may act independently to mediate the actions of different signaling systems and factors (for example estrogen) (6). The only indication in human cells that there is a potential native super-enhancer in this region that may be commissioned in pancreatic cancer or colon cancer is that of Hnisz et al., but data in these same papers suggest that this region is not normally a super-enhancer.</p><p>5) The increased expression of <italic>Myc</italic> in splenic B-cells deleted of 2-540 suggests that this region does not act a purely as an enhancer, but rather that there must be tissue specific negative cis-region(s) interposed amongst the positive acting sequences. The authors should examine chromatin marks, DHS sites etc. as well as the 2-367 B-cells to see if they might learn anything about the nature of the B-cell repressive region. In any case, these results argue against this being a huge, monotonically positive acting super-enhancer.</p><p>6) Does the whole &quot;super-enhancer&quot; region act as a single unit or do different regions show a proclivity to act in different tissues? Do the 2-540 and 2-367 deletions behave similarly with respect to tumorigenesis and to carcinogens across different tissues?</p><p>7) The authors state that they see no effect of the 2-540 deletion on expression other in tumors and in splenic B-cells. The authors should study carefully the recent <italic>eLife</italic> paper by Lorenzin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">7</xref>) and then reexamine their own <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Lorenzin et al. report that maneuvers that decrease MYC lead to preferential decrease in expression of the most highly expressed genes that are most easily saturated with MYC. Note that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> left-colon that the blue dots almost all fall below the diagonal of identity for the most highly expressed genes just as would be expected if <italic>Myc</italic> acts according to Lorenzin. Lorenzin et al. also report that as the promoters of the most highly expressed genes increases further, the excess MYC progressively backfills the promoters of more weakly expressed genes thus augmenting the output of middle level expressed genes. Note that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> left spleen, that the green dots bulge above the diagonal in the middle region, again just as explained by Lorenzin et al. and in accord with the amplifier model of MYC action. Thus, it seems that low levels of <italic>Myc</italic> are not inert, but that the cellular systems are robust enough to handle the changes in <italic>Myc</italic> under these conditions.</p><p>8) The authors assert that there are no phenotypic consequences of lowering <italic>Myc</italic>. They cite the paper of Dubois et al. (8) that <italic>Myc</italic> expression is only essential in the placenta, but not in the epiblast (embryo proper) except when the embryos die a couple of days later at E11.5 from a failure of hematopoietic stem cells; when the embryos die all other tissues appeared normal for their stage of development-however almost half of gestation remained to be completed and there is nothing in the Dubois paper to indicate that growth and maturation of all remaining tissues proceeds normally through gestation and after birth. Many studies have found phenotypes associated with decreased levels of <italic>Myc</italic>. Trumpp et al. (9) constructed an allelic series that clearly showed that habitus size changes according to the amount of <italic>Myc</italic>. In light of this, the authors need to conduct some careful measurements of animal and organ weight, size and cell numbers to substantiate their claim that there is no phenotype. A superficial perusal of the thoracic and abdominal contents might miss subtle changes. What about limb length-limb size that has been reported to be influenced by <italic>Myc</italic>?</p><p>9) Very significantly, the authors' conclusions about <italic>Myc</italic> acting digitally off-on by weak versus strong expression to buffer its effects, is at odds with a large and significant literature that says that small changes in MYC are sometimes very physiologically significant apart from tumors, and that even very low levels of MYC may be important (for example fibroblasts may survive with low MYC, but they do not survive without MYC (see the work of Sedivy, etc.). It is also at odds with reports describing haploinsufficiency of <italic>Myc</italic>. Unlike normal fibroblasts, fibroblasts haploinsufficient for MYC cannot be immortalized by expression of hTERT (10). Mice haploinsufficient for <italic>Myc</italic> live longer and are smaller (9, 11). While <italic>Myc</italic> is dispensable for hepatocytes (12, 13), a bit of <italic>Myc</italic> seems to be required for colonic crypt cells (14). Less than two-fold differences in MYC expression (up or down) provoke super-competition in which the cells with more MYC kill and replace the cells with less MYC (in flies and in mice) (15, 16). Slight differential changes in <italic>Myc</italic> modify the temporal profile of the immune response (17). There are many more examples. Small differences in MYC seem to be associated with many, sometimes subtle, manifestations making it difficult to accept the digital interpretation proposed by the authors.</p><p>1) Pott S, Lieb JD: What are super-enhancers?

Myc expression under normal physiological conditions could vary according to signaling and hence the concept of an 'on versus off' state seems over-simplified. For example, Heinzel et al. (Nature Immunol 18:96-104 (2017); see reference 17 below) demonstrated that Myc expression dose effect is influenced by input signals into T cell activation. In this regard, the authors should document whether normal T cell activation is altered in the mutant Myc animals.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that <italic>Myc</italic> is important in immune cells, but would like to maintain a distinction between normal homeostasis and pathological states in the manuscript. We have included additional data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> showing the lack of a genotype-dependent effect on T-cell number in these mice. We also do not expect T-cell activation to be strongly affected, as enhancers active in T-cells are on the other side of the <italic>Myc</italic> ORF (Herranz et al. 2014), and the mice are healthy and do not display an immunodeficient phenotype. We have now clarified this (subsection “Loss of the super-enhancer region leads to tissue-specific changes in <italic>Myc</italic> expression”, second paragraph).</p><p>To further clarify the manuscript, we have also now made it clearer that T-cell activation occurs generally under pathological conditions and does not fit under our definition of &quot;normal cellular homeostasis&quot; (Discussion, sixth paragraph). As the distinction between normal conditions in laboratory mice, and pathological conditions is central to the manuscript, in our view it would still be very important to clarify this point.</p><p>We have also now added a paragraph to the Discussion section to discuss the various pathological conditions where <italic>Myc</italic> is clearly involved, and now state that it will be important to assess the role of the 538 kb region in these processes in future studies.</p><p>We feel that a detailed study of T-cell activation kinetics is beyond the scope of the current work. However, if such an experiment is essential for publication, we can run the experiment and provide the data. Given that our mouse facility is moving, it would delay publication approximately 6 months.</p><p> <italic>2) The Myc heterozygotes (Sedivy and coworkers: Hofmann et al. Cell 2015) have increased longevity. It stands to reason that the Myc super-enhancer mutant may also have increased longevity due to decreased Myc expression. In this regard, the manuscript could be further enriched by examining whether mTOR signaling is decreased in the super-enhancer Myc mutant tissues or cells.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the finding of <italic>Myc</italic> contributing to longevity is interesting, and we are aware that Hoffman et al. showed the reduction in age related symptoms in <italic>Myc<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice. However, the deletion of a super-enhancer region that contains tissue-specific enhancers regulating <italic>Myc</italic> expression in our model is not equivalent to a heterozygous deletion of the <italic>Myc</italic> gene in the whole mouse body. So we expect that the effect of the enhancer deletion on longevity, if any, to be tissue specific or minor. To detect an effect on longevity would require a large cohort of mice as well as ethical permits to age the mice, which we cannot obtain in Sweden (we have to sacrifice mice that are old or sick). The analysis would also take 2-3 years. Thus, analysis of longevity is not feasible within the scope of the present study. As the effects of the enhancer deletion are tissue-specific, molecular analysis in the absence of phenotypic data would not be informative. To address this point, we have added a sentence to the Discussion section citing the Hofmann et al. paper and pointing out that the mouse could be used as a model to study which tissues contribute to the longevity phenotype (Discussion, fourth paragraph).</p><p> <italic>3) The authors build upon their previous work in which they showed elegantly that a 1.7 kb region containing a SNP in a TCF binding site 335 kb upstream of the MYC TSS is associated with slightly higher levels of Myc, and that these slightly higher Myc levels considerably enhance tumorigenesis. The reduced susceptibility to tumorigenesis of the 2-540 deletion is an interesting observation, but it would be nice to include some sort of assurance that the effects are not mediated solely through the 335 region that has already been reported and characterized by the authors (and others) and shown confer resistance to tumor formation when deleted in APC<sup>min</sup> mice. Are DMBA/MPA induced mammary tumors influenced by the 335-region deletion or are separate segments of the 2-540 region involved?</italic> </p><p>We agree that it is important to analyze whether the effects of the large deletion are solely due to the <italic>Myc-335</italic> region. We have now included additional discussion and data to show that this is not the case. The large region deleted in this mouse model contains several tissue-specific enhancers in addition to the <italic>Myc-335</italic> (Tuupanen et al. 2009; Ahmadiyeh et al. 2010); this is clarified in the fourth paragraph of the Introduction. In addition, the breast cancer susceptibility locus in humans is distinct from the colon cancer susceptibility locus that harbors Myc-335, and there is thus no reason to expect that <italic>Myc-335</italic> would contribute to breast cancer. This is now stated in the first paragraph of the subsection “The Myc super-enhancer region is required for tumorigenesis in mice”. Although we cannot rule out the possibility at this time that <italic>Myc-335</italic> contributes to the DMBA/MPA induced mammary tumors, additional elements outside of the <italic>Myc-335</italic> region are definitely also playing a role in tumor models. We have now included data to show that the 2-540 region deletion in an <italic>Apc<sup>min</sup></italic> background results in fewer polyps than the <italic>Myc-335</italic> deletion alone (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In this study the wild-type mice had on an average 56 polyps at around 4 months of age (n=5) when they had to be euthanized for ethical reasons similar to what we reported previously. The mice with the 2-540 deletion looked healthy and had on an average 2.4 polyps even at 6 months of age (n=5) compared to an average of 14.33 polyps we reported for the <italic>Myc-335</italic> null mice at 4 months of age. These results are consistent with multiple Tcf7l2 ChIP-seq peaks that are observed in the colon within this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This data is now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, and the results are discussed in the second paragraph of the subsection “The <italic>Myc</italic> super-enhancer region is required for tumorigenesis in mice”.</p><p> <italic>4) The authors are a bit loose with the term super-enhancer (1, 2). The labeling and characterization of the 2-540 kb deleted region as a super-enhancer, especially under physiological conditions is quite questionable. All of the literature on Myc and its surrounding gene desert indicates that super-enhancer commissioning seems to be a pathological and not physiological event, often associated with translocations that juxtapose super-enhancers from far-distant regions, usually on other chromosomes (3-5). It seems to be a bit premature to define 0.5 megabases as a super-enhancer. This is quite large, even for a super-enhancer and the authors have performed no functional experiments or computational analysis to discriminate this region as a super-enhancer versus a collection of typical enhancers that each may act independently to mediate the actions of different signaling systems and factors (for example estrogen) (6). The only indication in human cells that there is a potential native super-enhancer in this region that may be commissioned in pancreatic cancer or colon cancer is that of Hnisz et al., but data in these same papers suggest that this region is not normally a super-enhancer.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the term super-enhancer is somewhat controversial, and that the precise boundaries of presumed regulatory regions vary in different cell types and under different conditions. The region deleted in this study contains several cancer susceptibility loci and some of these have been linked to the presence of tissue-specific enhancers active in cancer cells. As the reviewer points out, in most cases the enhancers or super-enhancers identified within this region appear to be very tumor specific (Ahmadiyeh et al. 2010; Hnisz et al. 2013; Loven et al. 2013). This suggests that they regulate <italic>Myc</italic> under pathological condition without affecting the proliferation/ homeostasis of normal cells. Our results confirm this idea. Since this region contains several tissue-specific and cancer-specific regulatory elements that fall both under the definition of enhancers and super-enhancers we have referred to the deleted region as the &quot;super-enhancer region&quot; (not &quot;super-enhancer&quot;). We have now clarified this definition in the Introduction (last paragraph).</p><p><italic>5) The increased expression of Myc in splenic B-cells deleted of 2-540 suggests that this region does not act a purely as an enhancer, but rather that there must be tissue specific negative cis-region(s) interposed amongst the positive acting sequences. The authors should examine chromatin marks, DHS sites etc. as well as the 2-367 B-cells to see if they might learn anything about the nature of the B-cell repressive region. In any case, these results argue against this being a huge, monotonically positive acting super-enhancer.</italic> </p><p>We agree that increased <italic>Myc</italic> expression in the splenic B-cells can suggest the presence of a negative cis-region. However, a more likely possibility is that the deletion of 538 kb brings an enhancer outside of this region closer to the <italic>Myc</italic> promoter. This is because a known B-cell specific enhancer at -556 has been described as the target for EBNA2 mediated large-scale directional reorganization of <italic>Myc</italic> promoter-enhancer interactions (Wood et al. 2016). We have now discussed this issue (subsection “Loss of the super-enhancer region leads to tissue-specific changes in <italic>Myc</italic> expression”, third paragraph and in legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), and included chromatin analysis of wild-type mouse B-cells in the revised version that show the enhancers in the region that is retained in the deletion (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p> <italic>6) Does the whole &quot;super-enhancer&quot; region act as a single unit or do different regions show a proclivity to act in different tissues? Do the 2-540 and 2-367 deletions behave similarly with respect to tumorigenesis and to carcinogens across different tissues?</italic> </p><p>Several studies have shown that this region contains enhancers that act in a tissue-specific manner and that the different cancer susceptibilities span distinct segments of this region. The data presented in this manuscript also shows that the active enhancer marks span different regions in different tissues/cells (see colon vs. fibroblast ChIP-seq data). We do not think that the whole super-enhancer acts as a single unit, rather specific sub-regions regulate MYC in a tissue-specific manner. We have now clarified this in the revised version (Introduction, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>7) The authors state that they see no effect of the 2-540 deletion on expression other in tumors and in splenic B-cells. The authors should study carefully the recent eLife paper by Lorenzin et al. (7) and then reexamine their own <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Lorenzin et al. report that maneuvers that decrease MYC lead to preferential decrease in expression of the most highly expressed genes that are most easily saturated with MYC. Note that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> left-colon that the blue dots almost all fall below the diagonal of identity for the most highly expressed genes just as would be expected if Myc acts according to Lorenzin. Lorenzin et al. also report that as the promoters of the most highly expressed genes increases further, the excess MYC progressively backfills the promoters of more weakly expressed genes thus augmenting the output of middle level expressed genes. Note that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> left spleen, that the green dots bulge above the diagonal in the middle region, again just as explained by Lorenzin et al. and in accord with the amplifier model of MYC action. Thus, it seems that low levels of Myc are not inert, but that the cellular systems are robust enough to handle the changes in Myc under these conditions.</italic> </p><p>We agree that in cultured cells <italic>Myc</italic> is active. Lorenzin et al. nicely showed that due to differences in the MYC affinity to promoters, genes differ in their response to MYC levels. We can clarify that the more detailed model proposed by Lorenzin et al. and our model are not mutually exclusive. The `off-state´ of <italic>Myc</italic> under resting physiological conditions in our model is lower than that found in cultured cells by Lorenzin et al. That is why we see little effect on target gene expression due to further downregulation of <italic>Myc</italic>. To address this point we compared wild-type and 2-540 null FPKM values for gene sets from Lorenzin et al. paper in our colon and spleen RNA-seq data. We did not find differences in either the high-affinity binding or the low-affinity binding gene sets. We also plotted the median FPKM values of gene transcripts for the colon data since one of the wild-type samples for unknown reason had higher amounts of ribosomal structural protein transcripts. This is now included as new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>In addition, we have added an intermediate state to the model, and also discuss the responses of low affinity and high affinity targets (Discussion, sixth paragraph).</p><p> <italic>8) The authors assert that there are no phenotypic consequences of lowering Myc. They cite the paper of Dubois et al. (8) that Myc expression is only essential in the placenta, but not in the epiblast (embryo proper) except when the embryos die a couple of days later at E11.5 from a failure of hematopoietic stem cells; when the embryos die all other tissues appeared normal for their stage of development-however almost half of gestation remained to be completed and there is nothing in the Dubois paper to indicate that growth and maturation of all remaining tissues proceeds normally through gestation and after birth. Many studies have found phenotypes associated with decreased levels of Myc. Trumpp et al. (9) constructed an allelic series that clearly showed that habitus size changes according to the amount of Myc. In light of this, the authors need to conduct some careful measurements of animal and organ weight, size and cell numbers to substantiate their claim that there is no phenotype. A superficial perusal of the thoracic and abdominal contents might miss subtle changes. What about limb length-limb size that has been reported to be influenced by Myc?</italic> </p><p>We agree that Trumpp et al. correlated a reduced body size and weight with decreased <italic>Myc</italic> levels. However the paper by Duboiset al. found no effect on the size of embryos lacking <italic>Myc</italic> thus attributing the effect on the weight/ body size to the placental requirement of <italic>Myc</italic>. We agree with the reviewer that in the study by Dubois et al. nearly half of the gestation stage is still remaining and could result in smaller weight or size. Heterozygous mice in the study by Trumpp et al. had on an average a reduction of 18-22% in body mass and were visibly distinguishable from the wild-type littermates. We have now clarified that we cannot see visible size differences of 2-540 null mice, and do not detect a significant weight difference in our mouse colony based on 17 wild-type and 15 null mice (Discussion, third paragraph). We have also now explained that since we are deleting very tissue specific enhancers as opposed to the <italic>Myc</italic> gene deletion, we do not expect striking difference on the body weight or size.</p><p>Detection of any more subtle changes in body weight or organ size would require a large cohort of mice and even if such effects were found, they would not materially affect the main point of the manuscript. Regarding the tissues we focused on prostate, intestine, spleen, mammary gland and bladder based on the cancer susceptibility loci identified within this region. Histological examination of these tissues does not show morphological defects. We have found that the total number of spleen cells are reduced which could be due to the decreased number of B-cells shown in the manuscript. We have now included this data in the revised version (legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We have also now added an explicit sentence to the Discussion stating that we do not claim that the mice have &quot;no phenotype&quot;, but rather that there is &quot;no overt phenotype&quot; that affects the viability or fertility of the mice under laboratory conditions (Discussion, sixth paragraph).</p><p> <italic>9) Very significantly, the authors' conclusions about Myc acting digitally off-on by weak versus strong expression to buffer its effects, is at odds with a large and significant literature that says that small changes in MYC are sometimes very physiologically significant apart from tumors, and that even very low levels of MYC may be important (for example fibroblasts may survive with low MYC, but they do not survive without MYC (see the work of Sedivy, etc.). It is also at odds with reports describing haploinsufficiency of Myc. Unlike normal fibroblasts, fibroblasts haploinsufficient for MYC cannot be immortalized by expression of hTERT (10). Mice haploinsufficient for Myc live longer and are smaller (9, 11). While Myc is dispensable for hepatocytes (12, 13), a bit of Myc seems to be required for colonic crypt cells (14). Less than two-fold differences in MYC expression (up or down) provoke super-competition in which the cells with more MYC kill and replace the cells with less MYC (in flies and in mice) (15, 16). Slight differential changes in Myc modify the temporal profile of the immune response (17). There are many more examples. Small differences in MYC seem to be associated with many, sometimes subtle, manifestations making it difficult to accept the digital interpretation proposed by the authors.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that <italic>Myc</italic> is required for several aspects of the embryonic development in mice, and in the adult hematopoietic system (e.g. (Wilson et al. 2004)) and in cultured cells. <italic>Myc</italic> heterozygous mice are also smaller, from birth to adulthood, presumably due to the effect on placenta or embryonic development. We have now included more discussion of these phenotypes in the revised version (Discussion, third paragraph).</p><p>However, several studies have documented that loss of <italic>Myc</italic> appears to have little effect on normal tissue homeostasis of most adult tissues in vivo. In the skin, loss of <italic>Myc</italic> under normal conditions is well tolerated in vivo while keratinocytes with a <italic>Myc</italic> deletion exhibit reduced proliferation in vitro (Oskarsson et al. 2006). In the case of the intestine where <italic>Myc</italic> is expressed in the proliferating crypts, there are conflicting reports. Although Muncan et al. (2006) showed the loss of <italic>Myc</italic> null crypts in their study, a parallel study (Bettess et al. 2005) showed that the proliferation and maintenance of the adult crypts was not dependent on <italic>Myc</italic> expression. To add to the confusion, in Sansom et al. (2007) some of the authors of the Muncan et al. paper cite their own work as evidence of &quot;remarkably little effect of [<italic>Myc</italic>] gene deletion on intestinal proliferation&quot;. Thus, it appears that the matter is controversial. We have not detected prominent defects associated with the 2-540 null genotype in the intestine. We think this is not surprising given that proliferation in vivo can occur in the absence / reduced levels of <italic>Myc</italic> (discussed above) and that we have a tissue-specific effect on the <italic>Myc</italic> regulation.</p><p>In addition, in our model we do not see any prominent <italic>Myc</italic>-associated phenotypes that have been previously reported e.g. in the haematopoietic system which is consistent with the fact that enhancers regulating the hematological malignancies or normal immune cell function have been identified around 1 Mb downstream of <italic>Myc</italic> gene and not included in our deletions (Herranz et al. 2014).</p><p>We have now addressed the literature on <italic>Myc</italic> by citing the relevant references, and pointing out that the results are in some cases conflicting, but overall it is clear that <italic>Myc</italic> is critical in tumors, and required for growth of cultured cells and during some developmental processes (Discussion, third and sixth paragraphs). In our mice, we do not see major effects, which could theoretically be due to the remaining <italic>Myc</italic> levels, but more likely caused by the tissue-specific role of the region that was deleted. This is now stated in the aforementioned paragraph.</p><p>We have also modified the model to cite the previous papers and to clarify that <italic>Myc</italic> levels also matter, and that the &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; states as depicted in the original model do not explain some developmental phenotypes or quantitative regulation of immune cell responses (as in Heinzel et al). We have added an &quot;intermediate <italic>Myc</italic> level&quot; panel to the model to address this, and to clarify that the two extreme states are relevant to &quot;cancer&quot;, and to &quot;normal physiological conditions in adult tissue homeostasis in the absence of tissue damage or infection&quot; (Discussion, sixth paragraph and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
