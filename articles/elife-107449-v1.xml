multicellular development. However, the molecular processes that underlie development and life cycle progression in the brown algae remain poorly understood. In this study, pairwise comparisons of gametophyte and sporophyte transcriptomes across 10 diverse brown algal species showed that the total number of genes exhibiting generation-biased or generation-specific expression in each species was correlated with the degree of dimorphism between life cycle generations. However, analysis of gene ontology terms assigned to the generation-biased/generation-specific genes indicated that each generation (i.e. the sporophyte and the gametophyte) also has characteristic broad life-cycle-related features that have been conserved during evolution. A more detailed analysis of <italic>Ectocarpus</italic> species 7 identified progressive transcriptome changes over its entire life cycle, with a particularly marked change in transcriptome composition during the first day of sporophyte development, characterised by downregulation of flagellar and transcription factor genes and upregulation of a subset of translation genes. Comparison with a similar transcriptomic time series for the evolutionarily distant (about 250 My) brown alga <italic>Dictyota dichotoma</italic> indicated considerable conservation of co-expressed gene modules between the two species, particularly for modules that were enriched in genes assigned to evolutionarily conserved functional categories. This study therefore identified broad life-cycle- and development-related patterns of gene expression that are conserved across the brown algae.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Coastal marine environments are often populated by large underwater forests of brown algae, such as seaweeds and kelps.

The group includes large (up to 50 m) multicellular organisms that rival many land plant species in complexity. From a developmental point of view, brown algae are particularly interesting because they evolved complex multicellularity independently of land plants and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cock et al., 2010</xref>). Taxonomically, these seaweeds are grouped into the class Phaeophyceae, which is a major taxon within the stramenopiles, and therefore very distant, phylogenetically, from the Archaeplastida and the Opisthokonta lineages that gave rise to land plants and animals, respectively. Consequently, brown algae represent interesting alternative systems to investigate the evolution and molecular bases of developmental processes.</p><p>Most brown algae have haploid-diploid life cycles involving an alternation between two independent multicellular generations, the sporophyte and the gametophyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cock et al., 2014</xref>). These seaweeds are therefore capable of deploying two different multicellular developmental programs, each at the appropriate stage of their complex life cycles. The ecological functions of brown algal haploid-diploid life cycles can be difficult to study, particularly when one of the generations is microscopic. However, there is evidence, in kelps for example, that microscopic stages (gametophytes, but possibly also very young sporophyte stages) may have a survival function, allowing a population to persist when the macroscopic sporophyte stage is not present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carney and Edwards, 2006</xref>). A study of populations of filamentous brown algae of the genus <italic>Ectocarpus</italic> in the field indicated that gametophytes grew epiphytically on the brown alga <italic>Scytosiphon promiscuus</italic> (then classified taxonomically as <italic>Scytosiphon lomentaria</italic>) in the spring, whereas sporophytes grew throughout the year on abiotic substrata. These observations indicate that the sporophyte may be the most important generation for persistence of the population in this genus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Couceiro et al., 2015</xref>). Note, however, that a principally asexual population of <italic>Ectocarpus siliculosus</italic> located at a second site inhabited both epiphytic and epilithic niches, indicating that the relationship between life cycle generation and niche may be complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Couceiro et al., 2015</xref>). The phenology of the brown alga <italic>D. dichotoma</italic> also appears to be complex with, for example, overlapping generations and sporophytes and gametophytes reported to occur simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tronholm et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The relative sizes of the two life cycle generations vary considerably across brown algae, with either the sporophyte or the gametophyte being the largest generation (dimorphism) or the two generations having very similar sizes and morphologies (isomorphy). Transitions between life cycles with different degrees of dimorphism have occurred frequently during the evolution of the brown algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cock et al., 2014</xref>). Variations on this central sexual life cycle have been observed in culture for several species, and these variations can provide insights into the mechanisms that control life cycle progression. For example, if <italic>Ectocarpus</italic> gametes fail to fuse with a gamete of the opposite sex to form a zygote, they are often capable of germinating parthenogenetically to produce a haploid partheno-sporophyte that is morphologically and functionally indistinguishable from a diploid sporophyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Müller, 1967</xref>). The existence of these haploid sporophytes indicates that life cycle generation identity is not determined by ploidy in this species and is therefore presumably under genetic control.</p><p>The occurrence of two multicellular generations during the life cycles of most brown algae allows genetic screens to be carried out for mutations that cause switching between the development programs of the two generations, that is mutations that lead to deployment of the incorrect program at a specific point in the life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Coelho and Cock, 2020</xref>). Using this approach, two three-amino-acid-loop-extension (TALE) homeodomain transcription factor (HD TF) genes, <italic>OUROBOROS (ORO</italic>) or <italic>SAMSARA (SAM</italic>), have been shown to be necessary for deployment of the sporophyte generation developmental program in <italic>Ectocarpus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coelho et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arun et al., 2019</xref>). Mutations in either of these genes suppress the ability of the alga to produce a functional sporophyte, leading to deployment of the gametophyte program at life cycle stages where a sporophyte should normally be produced. In addition, <italic>Ectocarpus</italic> sporophytes have been shown to produce a diffusible factor that can induce sporophyte development in gametophyte initial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yao et al., 2021</xref>). The diffusible factor does not induce life cycle generation switching in <italic>oro</italic> or <italic>sam</italic> mutant gametophyte initial cells, indicating that it acts upstream of ORO and SAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arun et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The genetic pathways that underlie the deployment of the sporophyte and gametophyte developmental programs in brown algae are still poorly understood. Mutations in a small number of genes have been shown to lead to developmental defects in <italic>Ectocarpus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Macaisne et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Godfroy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Godfroy et al., 2023</xref>) but a mutation in the <italic>IMMEDIATE UPRIGHT</italic> gene is the only lesion that specifically affects the development of one of the two generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Peters et al., 2008</xref>). Transcriptomics has been used to identify genes that are differentially expressed between the two generations in <italic>Ectocarpus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arun et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lipinska et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bourdareau et al., 2021</xref>). These transcriptomic analyses focused on comparisons of adult sporophyte and gametophyte thalli and have allowed the identification of several hundred genes that are differentially expressed between these two stages of development. However, the analyses were not designed to detect genes that are important during early development and do not provide any information about the kinetics of gene expression over development. In recent years, several detailed studies have generated gene expression data for multiple developmental stages or organs for several different brown algal species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pearson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Graf et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Uji et al., 2024</xref>), including a transcriptomic analysis of early stages of <italic>Dictyota dichotoma</italic> sporophyte development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bogaert et al., 2017</xref>). This latter study detected changes in the transcriptome less than 1 hr after fertilisation, providing evidence for de novo transcription in the zygote, and identified a set of genes with diverse functions that were differentially regulated during early sporophyte development.</p><p>In the current study, transcriptomic data, recently generated by the Phaeoexplorer project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Denoeud et al., 2024</xref>), was used to analyse differential gene expression between the adult sporophyte and gametophyte generations of a broad range of brown algae. The proportion of genes that showed generation-biased or generation-specific expression across these two stages was correlated with the level of dimorphism between the two generations indicating that the differentially expressed genes are primarily linked to morphological differentiation. However, analysis of gene ontology terms also identified underlying, life-cycle-related characteristics that have been conserved during evolution, with general classes of gene function being conserved across sporophytes of the 10 species, and different general classes of gene function being conserved across the gametophytes. In addition, analysis of transcriptomic data corresponding to multiple stages of the <italic>Ectocarpus</italic> life cycle, generated by combining published RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data with newly-generated timepoints, identified co-expression modules containing genes with specific expression patterns during life cycle progression. This analysis identified several modules that exhibited marked expression pattern changes during early sporophyte evolution, providing insights into key genetic events during this period. Comparison with a set of gene co-expression modules generated for <italic>D. dichotoma</italic> identified conserved features shared by these two distantly related brown algal species.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Across the brown algal lineage, the proportion of generation-biased genes is correlated with the degree of life cycle dimorphism</title><p>RNA-seq data for the adult sporophyte and gametophyte generations of 10 different brown algal species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) were analysed to obtain a broad overview of generation-biased gene expression across the brown algae.

As previously observed in a smaller-scale analysis that looked at four different brown algal species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lipinska et al., 2019</xref>), the proportion of generation-biased/generation-specific genes (see Materials and methods for definitions of generation-biased and generation-specific genes) identified in each species was positively correlated with the degree of intergenerational dimorphism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Surprisingly, however, species with strongly dimorphic life cycles had greater numbers of both sporophyte- and gametophyte-biased/specific genes, indicating either that gene downregulation plays an important role in the establishment of dimorphic generations or that there is also cryptic complexification of the more morphologically simple generation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Generation-biased gene expression across the brown algae.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cladogram of the brown algae showing the 10 species for which generation-biased gene expression was compared.

There is therefore considerable scope for many genes to have functions during both generations of the life cycle. In terms of selection, this observation indicates that most genes are potentially directly exposed to purifying selection during the haploid phase (where there is no effect of masking by a second allele of each locus) and few genes are expressed solely in a diploid context where masking would be most effective.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The sporophyte and gametophyte generations express characteristic general functional categories of genes</title><p>To evaluate the degree of conservation of generation-biased/specific gene sets across the 10 brown algal species, an orthogroup analysis was carried out (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) using Orthofinder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Emms and Kelly, 2019</xref>). Pairwise comparisons of generation-biased/specific genes that had orthologues in all 10 species indicated that the sets of generation-biased/specific genes were poorly conserved across species, even for closely-related species such as the two <italic>Saccharina</italic> spp. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). None of the orthogroups exhibited conserved generation bias across all the 10 species. The lack of conservation of generation-biased/specific gene sets across species is in line with observations made in the earlier study that compared four brown algal species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lipinska et al., 2019</xref>). However, despite the poor conservation of generation-biased/specific expression at the individual gene level, analysis of enriched gene ontology terms across the entire generation-biased/specific gene sets from the 10 studied brown algae identified distinct sets of enriched terms for both the sporophyte-biased/specific and the gametophyte-biased/specific genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and the general classes of enriched gene ontology term were conserved for each individual generation across the 10 species. For example, the sporophyte-biased/specific gene sets tended to be enriched in genes with predicted functions related to membrane transport and metabolism, whereas the gametophyte-biased/specific gene sets tended to be enriched in genes with predicted functions related to flagella biosynthesis and function, protein biosynthesis, and DNA-related functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These analyses identified an underlying similarity between sporophyte generations across species and between gametophyte generations across species, and indicated that these generation-characteristic patterns of gene expression are present even in species where the two generations are isomorphic or nearly isomorphic.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Biological function gene ontology term enrichment in the generation-biased/specific gene sets of the 10 species.</title><p>Conserved general functional categories are indicated by coloured boxes. padj, p-value adjusted for multiple testing based on the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate; GA, gametophyte; SP, sporophyte.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-107449-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Changes in gene expression patterns over the course of the <italic>Ectocarpus</italic> species 7 life cycle reflect the cyclic transitions between life cycle stages</title><p>The above analyses specifically provided information about gene regulation patterns underlying morphological and functional differences between the adult stages of the two generations.

To further investigate this observation, the Trendy R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bacher et al., 2018</xref>) was used to calculate the fit of segmented regression models to individual gene expression patterns in order to identify individual genes that best matched the overall pattern of regression breakpoints. When this approach was applied to the sporophyte developmental series, a good regression fit (R²&gt;0.5) could be calculated for 5196 genes and 32% of these genes exhibited a change in expression (i.e. a regression breakpoint) during the transition from the gamete stage to the sporophyte initial cell (24 h) stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), indicating that this transition involves a major shift in the pattern of gene expression.</p><p>To complement the above analysis, DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Love et al., 2014</xref>) was used to identify genes that were differentially expressed between the free-swimming gamete and the sporophyte initial cell stage.

For three of these modules, ‘pink’, ‘salmon’, and ‘turquoise’, the genes were also upregulated during the gametophyte stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The ‘pink’ module was enriched in gene ontology terms related to nucleosome assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) and the ‘salmon’ module, which contained a large number of monoexonic genes, was enriched in genes predicted to have DNA-related functions (enriched gene ontology terms included ‘DNA integration’, ‘DNA recombination’, ‘DNA repair’, ‘DNA helicase’, and ‘telomere maintenance’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The ‘turquoise’ module, which had an expression profile very similar to that of the ‘salmon’ module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), was enriched in genes with predicted functions related to the flagella (enriched gene ontology terms included ‘dynein complex’, ‘cilium’, ‘BBSome’, ‘microtubule-based movement’, ‘axonemal dynein complex assembly’, ‘cilium movement’, and ‘microtubule motor activity’), and therefore presumably important for gamete motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The upregulation of ‘turquoise’ module genes in gametophytes is probably explained by the production of flagellated gametes in the gametangia of fertile thalli, although it is not clear why the genes were also expressed at quite a high level in pre-fertile, adult gametophytes. It is possible that transcripts already accumulate at this stage to prepare for the production of large numbers of gametes at fertility or that some of these genes are also involved in other cellular functions, for example related to the cytoskeleton.</p><p>Cell-wall biosynthesis functions were not significantly enriched in the ‘turquoise’, ‘salmon’, and ‘pink’ modules, but these modules contained the majority of annotated genes from two families of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), the GT23 family (four genes in the ‘turquoise’ and two genes in the ‘salmon’ module out of 10 genes in total) and the PL41 family (nine genes in the ‘turquoise’ module, five genes in the ‘salmon’ module and three genes in the ‘pink’ module out of 22 expressed, annotated PL41 genes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). The GT23 family is predicted to encode fucosyltransferases, which would transfer fucosyl groups onto chitin oligosaccharides or glycoproteins, and the PL41 family contains mannose-specific alginate lyases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Inoue and Ojima, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mazéas et al., 2024</xref>). While the role of GT23 enzymes in gametes is unclear, it is possible that the polysaccharide depolymerisation action of PL41 lyases may facilitate gamete release from plurilocular sporangia in a manner analogous to the actions of pectate lyases and rhamnogalacturonan lyases during fruit ripening in land plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Méndez-Yañez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Uluisik and Seymour, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Al-Hinai et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>The remaining four modules that were significantly enriched in genes downregulated during the transition from the gamete to the early sporophyte (‘blue’, ‘green’, ‘red’, and ‘grey60’) did not exhibit gene upregulation during the gametophyte generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>).

Transcripts of approximately a third of the genes (147) in this transcription-associated dataset were more abundant in gametes than at the sporophyte initial cell stage (24 hr) but the proportion was similar to the proportion for all the genes in the genome indicating that there was not an overall enrichment of the gamete transcriptome in transcription-associated genes.</p><p>Taken together, analysis of the seven modules highlighted the importance of DNA-related functions, including nucleosome assembly and transcription, and flagella-related functions in gametes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Subsets of translation-related genes are upregulated in the sporophyte initial cell but the gamete already expresses some translation-related and photosynthesis genes</title><p>Nine modules were significantly enriched in genes upregulated during the transition between gametes and the sporophyte initial cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Most of the nine modules could not be clearly associated with a general cellular process, but three (‘cyan’, ‘magenta’, and ‘greenyellow’) were enriched in functions related to translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). These three modules exhibited very similar expression profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) but were enriched in different classes of translation-related gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–E</xref>). The ‘greenyellow’ module contained the RNA polymerase I gene which synthesises rRNA and was enriched in GO terms related to ‘nucleolus’, ‘small-subunit processome’, ‘ribosome large subunit assembly’, ‘ribosome biogenesis’, and ‘rRNA processing’. This module was therefore essentially related to the biosynthesis of the ribonucleic component of the ribosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The ‘cyan’ and ‘magenta’ modules were enriched in GO terms such as ‘tRNA aminoacylation for protein translation’, ‘tRNA processing’, ‘translation initiation’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). These two clusters included 25 of the 49 aminoacyl-tRNA-transferases annotated in the <italic>Ectocarpus</italic> species 7 genome, and also included a number of genes related to transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Notably, the ‘cyan’ module included nine eIF3-subunit-encoding genes out of a total of 15 annotated genes in the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Interestingly, the ‘cyan’ and ‘greenyellow’ modules were enriched (p&lt;0.05 clusterProfiler) in genes with a mitochondrial targeting sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), whereas the ‘magenta’ module was enriched (p&lt;0.05 clusterProfiler) in genes that encode proteins targeted to the plastid. The plastid-targeted proteins had predicted functions other than photosynthesis (e.g. translation and transport).</p><p>The ‘cyan’, ‘greenyellow’, and ‘magenta’ modules clustered together based on their average expression profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), suggesting that the three groups of translation-related functions share some level of co-expression. Taken together, the gene content of these three clusters suggests that there is a marked increase in translation in the initial cell compared to the gamete, both in the cytosolic and the organellar compartments. Importantly, however, not all translation-related genes exhibited marked upregulation during the transition from the gamete to the initial cell stage. For example, the transcripts of the many ribosomal-protein-encoding genes that were grouped in the ‘purple’ module were already present in gametes at relatively high levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The ribosomal protein genes are an interesting case because, whilst the majority of these genes were assigned to the ‘purple’ module, corresponding essentially to constitutive expression, a minority of the members of this broad family exhibited more complex expression patterns and were assigned to other modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In general, this latter minority of genes tends to encode proteins that are located in close vicinity in the P-stalk within the ribosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). The functional significance of this clustering is unclear, but it has been proposed that the P-stalk influences translation fidelity and the pool of mRNAs associated with the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wawiórka et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dopler et al., 2024</xref>). We also noted that ribosomal protein genes with non-constitutive expression patterns tended to have paralogues that were constitutively expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, cytosolic and organellar ribosomal protein genes did not exhibit the same patterns of expression with respect to the life cycle, with the genes encoding organellar proteins exhibiting more complex expression patterns (i.e. they were assigned to multiple modules; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>The ‘royalblue’ module is another example of a module which did not exhibit marked changes in expression between the gamete and the sporophyte initial cell. This module was highly enriched in genes related to photosynthesis or encoding chloroplast-targeted proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B and C</xref>). Based on the transcriptomic data, therefore, both cytosolic translation and photosynthesis appear to be processes that are already important at the gamete stage, although it is possible that transcripts related to these processes may accumulate in gametes but be translated at a later stage.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Comparative analysis of life-cycle-related gene expression between <italic>Ectocarpus</italic> species 7 and <italic>D. dichotoma</italic></title><p>To determine whether the developmental and life-cycle-related transcription patterns observed in <italic>Ectocarpus</italic> species 7 corresponded to common, fundamental features that are shared with other brown algae, a comparative analysis was carried out between <italic>Ectocarpus</italic> species 7 and <italic>D. dichotoma</italic>.

The latter were clustered with early sporophyte stages (zygote and 8 hr embryo), suggesting that the markedly different gene expression patterns observed in male gametes from the two species compared to other life cycle stages were related to their being actively swimming, flagellated cells rather than being a universal characteristic of all brown algal gametes.</p><p>Life-cycle-related gene expression in <italic>Ectocarpus</italic> species 7 and <italic>D. dichotoma</italic> was compared using two different approaches.

This analysis identified several pairs of life-cycle-related gene co-expression modules with significantly conserved gene contents between the two species, but not all modules were conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). As in the first analysis described above, conservation tended to be strongest for <italic>Ectocarpus</italic> species 7 modules that had been manually assigned general functional annotations and which had registered the highest values for module preservation statistics in the first analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p>‘Purple’ was one of the most strongly conserved <italic>Ectocarpus</italic> species 7 modules: 131 of its 284 one-to-one orthologues were shared with the <italic>D. dichotoma</italic> ‘blue’ module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), with most of the shared orthologues predicted to encode ribosomal proteins.

Therefore, both the gene content and the expression patterns of these two modules appear to have been conserved over evolution. Most of the one-to-one orthologues in the translation-related <italic>Ectocarpus</italic> species 7 modules ‘cyan’, ‘greenyellow’, and ‘magenta’ corresponded with genes in the <italic>D. dichotoma</italic> ‘turquoise’ module, consistent with the poorer resolution of the <italic>D. dichotoma</italic> modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

Moreover, some modules exhibited conservation not only in terms of gene (orthologue) content but also exhibited similar expression patterns over the course of the life cycle, proving further support for the (partial) conservation of life-cycle-related gene expression patterns over time.</p><p>The above analyses provided no evidence that transcription-related modules were conserved, overall, between <italic>Ectocarpus</italic> species 7 and <italic>D. dichotoma,</italic> but a more detailed analysis was carried out to determine whether life-cycle-related expression patterns might have been conserved for individual transcription factor genes. For this, 214 transcription factors with one-to-one orthologues in the two species were selected and their expression patterns (normalised expression z-scores) analysed across six life cycle stages that were approximately equivalent between the two species (gamete, zygote, early sporophyte, adult sporophyte, adult male gametophyte, and adult female gametophyte; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

However, the applied correction was stringent because a large number of orthologous genes were considered, so the most strongly correlated transcription factors may nonetheless merit further study in the future.

The regulatory systems that mediate this coordinated expression are currently unknown for brown algae but information about the mechanisms that co-ordinately regulate these processes in other eukaryote lineages can provide some indications of possible regulators. For example, in <italic>Ectocarpus</italic> species 7, four different modules were enriched in translation-related genes. In other eukaryotic lineages, a large proportion of ribosomal protein genes are regulated by the mTOR/PKA pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Martin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ni and Buszczak, 2023</xref>).

Phytochrome signalling counteracts negative regulation of photosynthesis genes by transcription factors such as PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR (PIF), PIF-LIKE (PIL), and GOLDEN2-LIKE1 (GLK1), which act downstream of various developmentally regulated pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Waters et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). However, orthologues of these transcription factors have not been found in brown algae and, consequently, coordinated regulation of photosynthetic genes in brown algae, as was observed here for the ‘royalblue’ module, presumably involves a different set of actors.</p><p>As far as flagella- and cilium-related genes are concerned, these organelles are widespread in eukaryotes and the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) probably possessed cilium-related structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carvalho-Santos et al., 2011</xref>). In Metazoans, two transcription factor families, FOXJ1 and RFX, control the formation of core components of all types of cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Choksi et al., 2014</xref>). However, although <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> also possesses an <italic>RFX</italic> gene, this family of transcription factors has only been shown to regulate ciliogenesis in metazoans and is not found outside the opisthokonts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chu et al., 2010</xref>). In <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, ciliogenesis is under the control of XAP5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2018</xref>), a transcription factor that is widely distributed across eukaryotic lineages.

This gene therefore represents a possible candidate for future analysis of the regulation of this pathway.</p><p>These examples illustrate how candidate regulatory genes may be identifiable for cellular processes that are highly conserved across eukaryotes, but candidates are more difficult to identify for modules that group brown-algal-specific genes of unknown function or functions such as the PL41 and GT23 gene families that do not have equivalents in other eukaryotic lineages. In some instances, regulatory genes may show similar expression patterns to the genes they regulate as a result of auto-regulation and therefore be included within a co-expression module, but this will not be the case for all regulators.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Identification of marked transcriptome changes during early sporophyte development</title><p>Analysis of RNA-seq data for multiple developmental stages of <italic>Ectocarpus</italic> species 7 provided a broad overview of gene expression throughout the life cycle, with a particular focus on the early stages of sporophyte development. Progression through the life cycle was correlated with concomitant, progressive changes in the composition of the transcriptome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and a particularly marked change in composition occurred at the transition from the gamete stage to the initial stage of sporophyte development. Most of the gene co-expression modules identified in this study exhibited changes in transcript abundance at this transition, and more than half of the genes in the genome were differentially expressed between the two stages.</p><p>Periods of large-scale changes in transcriptome composition have been observed during early development of both animals and land plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xue et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vastenhouw et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>), where they tend to coincide with the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). The MZT corresponds to the switch from reliance on maternal transcripts supplied to the transcriptionally inactive egg cell to mRNAs produced by transcription of the zygote genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tadros and Lipshitz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vastenhouw et al., 2019</xref>). During the MZT, induction of the expression of genes in the zygote genome, which is referred to as zygotic gene activation (ZGA), coincides with a phase of degradation of maternal transcripts in both animals and land plants. The exact timing of MZT varies across species, occurring rapidly in land plants, only hours after zygote formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>), but considerably later in animals, for example occurring 3 days after fertilisation in eight-cell human embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xue et al., 2013</xref>). However, even in animals, one-cell stage embryos exhibit a distinct transcriptome pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xue et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p><italic>Ectocarpus</italic> is not oogamous and both male and female gametes are small, flagellated cells that swim actively for a significant part of their lifetime. It therefore seems likely that these cells are already transcriptionally active during the gamete stage, in which case they would not rely solely on maternally produced transcripts (although this has not yet been investigated experimentally). Consequently, it is not clear whether there is a specific phase of degradation of maternal transcripts in gametes equivalent to the phases of maternal transcript degradation that have been observed at the MZT in land plants and animals. However, the marked change in transcriptome composition during early development is a feature that is shared with animals and land plants, underlining the broad importance of large-scale transcriptional changes during early development.</p><p>In terms of functional categories, fewer genes involved in flagellar function or transcription were expressed after the transition from the gamete stage to the initial stage of sporophyte development. Downregulation of flagellar genes is expected for this transition from a flagellated to a non-flagellated cell. The reduction in the number of expressed transcription factor genes is more surprising, but it is likely that the nature of the transcription factor genes expressed or repressed at this stage is more important than the overall number of transcription factor genes expressed. Trends in transcription factor gene up- and down-regulation are not consistent across species, with a decrease in the number of different transcription factor gene transcripts observed in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>) but an increase in rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2017</xref>), maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2017</xref>), and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xue et al., 2013</xref>), coinciding with the MZT. Moreover, in rice and maize, specific loci that play key roles during embryogenesis such as members of the BABYBOOM and WUSCHEL gene families are upregulated at the MZT/ZGA, supporting the idea that the identity of the specific transcription factor genes expressed is more important than the overall numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Note that <italic>Ectocarpus</italic> has AP2 domain and homeodomain proteins but no close homologues of the BABYBOOM and WUSCHEL families, so it is likely that different transcriptional regulators are involved in regulating development at the equivalent stage in brown algae.</p><p>Analysis of modules that exhibited overall gene upregulation between the gamete and early sporophyte stages identified translation as a general function that was upregulated during this transition. However, the upregulation of these genes does not appear to have corresponded to de novo induction of translation because a subset of translation-related genes was already expressed at the gamete stage. The overall gene expression pattern is more indicative of a step increase in translation capacity or complexity in the early sporophyte compared to the gamete.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conservation of life-cycle-related gene expression patterns across brown algal species</title><p>Comparison of generation-biased gene expression between adult gametophyte and sporophyte stages across 10 brown algal species identified a strong positive correlation between the degree of dimorphism between generations and the number of GBGs identified per species, indicating that the majority of GBG expression is related directly or indirectly to thallus morphology, at least for the adult stages analysed. Orthologue analysis indicated only weak overlap between GBG sets from different species, supporting an earlier conclusion that there is rapid turnover of GBG sets in brown algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lipinska et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, however, analysis of GO enrichment in GBG sets indicated that several broad functional categories were conserved across gametophyte-biased gene sets, whereas different broad functional categories were conserved across sporophyte-biased gene sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This observation suggests that the two generations have conserved life-cycle-related functional characteristics that are independent of morphological complexity or the degree of dimorphism between generations.</p><p>The analysis of whole adult individuals to study GBG expression therefore identified some interesting conserved life-cycle-related features, but the resolution of this approach is limited because only one sporophyte stage and one gametophyte stage was analysed per species and because, at the adult stage, the data represent an average view of the transcriptomes of multiple different cell types. The comparative analysis of multiple stages of early sporophyte development in <italic>Ectocarpus</italic> species 7 and <italic>D. dichotoma</italic> allowed a more detailed analysis of developmentally regulated gene expression and, notably, showed that there was considerable conservation of co-expressed gene modules between two species, particularly for modules that were enriched in genes involved in evolutionarily-conserved functional categories. Moreover, when the known life cycle regulatory genes <italic>SAM</italic> and <italic>ORO</italic> were analysed, there was clear evidence of conservation of their expression patterns across the two species. These results underline the importance of carrying out detailed transcriptomic analyses to identify and investigate conserved life cycle regulatory pathways.</p><p>Neither <italic>Ectocarpus</italic> species 7 nor <italic>D. dichotoma</italic> exhibits a high degree of dimorphism between life cycle generations.

During the sexual life cycle, the diploid sporophyte generation produces haploid meio-spores through meiosis. These spores germinate into haploid gametophytes that can be male or female (dioicy). Male and female gametes, produced, respectively, by male and female gametophytes, fuse to produce a diploid zygote, which, in turn, develops into the next sporophyte generation. The zoids (gametes and spores) are the only flagellated stages of the life cycle. In <italic>Ectocarpus</italic> species 7, the germinating zygote undergoes a developmentally symmetrical first division to produce a basal filament, which then branches to establish a basal filament system consisting of round and elongated cells. Once this basal system is established, upright filaments consisting of cylindrical cells grow up into the medium and these filaments bear the sexual structures, plurilocular sporangia and unilocular sporangia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Peters et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>Ectocarpus</italic> species 7 also exhibits variations on this basic sexual life cycle, at least in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Müller, 1967</xref>). For example, parthenogenesis of unfertilised gametes gives rise to haploid partheno-sporophytes. A few hours after release from the plurilocular sporangia, unfertilised free-swimming male gametes attach to the substrate, lose their flagella and acquire a round shape. Upon attachment, they start to develop a cell wall. After about 2 days, the initial cell elongates and divides, producing the first cells of the sporophytic basal filaments. All but one of the sporophyte stages analysed in this study corresponded to partheno-sporophyte samples. Partheno-sporophytes exhibit identical morphology and reproductive functionality to diploid sporophytes, and pure samples of early-stage diploid sporophytes are difficult to obtain because of a high level of gamete parthenogenesis in genetic crosses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Coelho et al., 2012a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Publicly available RNA-seq datasets</title><p>RNA-seq data for the sporophyte and gametophyte generations of the following 10 species was recovered from the Phaeoexplorer website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://phaeoexplorer.sb-roscoff.fr/">https://phaeoexplorer.sb-roscoff.fr/</ext-link>) or from public databases: <italic>Macrocystis pyrifera, Saccharina latissima, Saccharina japonica, Saccorhiza polyschides, Myriotrichia claveaformis, Pylaiella littoralis, D. dichotoma, Sphacelaria rigidula, Ectocarpus</italic> species 7, and <italic>Scytosiphon promiscuus</italic>.

Strict selection of only one-to-one orthologues did not identify sufficient orthologues (1038), principally due to gene model fragmentation in the lower quality genome assemblies. A more relaxed selection approach was therefore used, taking into account genome assembly quality. This relaxed approach, which required exactly one orthologue from the best quality assemblies (<italic>D. dichotoma</italic>, <italic>Ectocarpus</italic> species 7, <italic>P. littoralis</italic>, <italic>S. latissima</italic>, <italic>S. promiscuus,</italic> and <italic>S. rigidula</italic>), between zero and two orthologues for <italic>M. pyrifera</italic>, zero or one orthologue for <italic>S. japonica</italic>, and any number of orthologues for <italic>S. polyschides</italic> and <italic>M. clavaeformis</italic>, identified 9,317 orthogroups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

To calculate generation bias when a species possessed more than one gene model in a particular orthogroup, each model was given a score of +1, –1, or 0 if the expression data indicated that they were sporophyte-biased/specific, gametophyte-biased/specific or neither, respectively.

We nevertheless recommend that the authors carefully consider the constructive comments, as this will further improve their manuscript.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Line 32: The abstract states 'considerable conservation of co-expressed gene modules', but the degree of conservation between Ectocarpus and D. dichotoma appeared limited to specific subsets of genes with highly conserved housekeeping functions, e.g., translation. I think the wording of the abstract should be rephrased to better reflect this.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that genes with housekeeping functions figure strongly in the gene modules that showed strong conservation between <italic>Ectocarpus</italic> species 7 and <italic>D. dichotoma</italic> (and we actually highlight this point in the manuscript) but we do not believe that this invalidates the conservation. In the analysis shown in Figure 6A, for example, high scores were obtained for both connectivity and density for about a third of the gene modules and these modules cover broad range of cellular functions. This is a significant result given the large phylogenetic distance and we feel that &quot;considerable conservation&quot; is appropriate as a description of the level of correlation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Introduction - The Introduction needs a better explanation of the biology of the life cycle phases. Some of this information is present in the 1st paragraph of Materials and Methods, although it would be preferable to include this information within the main text, ideally within the Introduction before the Results are described. For example, when are flagella present? The presence of flagella could be indicated in Figure 3. The ecology of the life cycle is also not described. Are life cycles present in the same ecological niche? Do they co-exist or occupy distinct environments? It would be useful to understand how the observed genotypes could relate to this wider aspect of the brown algal biology.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a sentence to explain that zoids (gametes and spores) are the only flagellated stages of the life cycle (line 678). In addition, in the legend for Figure 3, we have indicated which of the life cycle stages analysed in panel 3A consisted entirely or partially of flagellated cells. We have also added information about phenology to the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Line 127. 'The proportion of generation specific genes was positively correlated with the level of dimorphism'. The level of dimorphism between species was not clear to me. This needs to be clearly displayed in Figure 1B.</p></disp-quote><p>We had attempted to illustrate the level of dimorphism, using the size of each generation as a measurable proxy, in Figure S1 but we agree that the information was not very clearly presented. To improve clarity, we now provide independent size scales for each generation of the life cycle in this figure and state in the legend that &quot;Size bars indicate the approximate sizes of each generation of each life cycle, providing an indication of the degree of dimorphism between the two generations.&quot;. In the text, Figure S1 is cited earlier in the paragraph but we now repeat the citation of the figure at the end of the sentence &quot;The proportion of generation-specific genes (...) was positively correlated with the level of dimorphism&quot; so that the reader can specifically consult the supplementary figure for this phenotypic parameter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Line 267. Are there known differences in cell wall composition between life cycle phases or within each generation as individual life cycle phases mature (e.g., differences between unicellular and multicellular stages)?</p></disp-quote><p>Detailed comparative analyses of cell wall composition at different stages of the life cycle have not been carried out for brown algae. However, Congo red stains <italic>Ectocarpus</italic> gametophytes but not sporophytes (Coelho <italic>et al</italic>., 2011), indicating a difference in cell wall composition between the two generations. Zoids (spores and gametes) do not have a cell wall and calcofluor white staining of meio-spores has indicated that a cell wall only starts to be deposited 24-48 hours post-release (Arun <italic>et al</italic>., 2013).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Line 388. The authors should comment on the accuracy of OrthoFinder for different gene types across this degree of divergence (250 MYA). The best conservation was found in genes with housekeeping characteristics (line 401). It may be that these gene modules show the highest degree of conservation in expression patterns, but I also wonder whether they pattern may also emerge because finding true orthologues is easier for highly conserved gene families.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not believe that this is the case because, as mentioned above, the &quot;housekeeping&quot; modules cover quite a broad range of cellular functions. Note also that the modules were given functional labels based on their being clearly enriched in genes corresponding to a particular class of function but not all the genes in a module have a predicted function that corresponds to the functional classification.</p><p>However, we have carried out an analysis to look for evidence of the bias proposed by the reviewer. For this, we used BLASTp identity scores as an approximate proxy for pairwise identity between <italic>Ectocarpus</italic> species 7 and <italic>D. dichotoma</italic> one-to-one orthologues in each module and plotted the mean identity score for each module against the Fischer test p-value of the contingency table in Figure 6C (Author response image 1).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Plot of estimations of the mean percent shared identity between the orthologues within each module (based on mean BLASTp identity scores) against log10(pvalue) values obtained with the Fisher's exact test applied in Figure 6C to determine whether pairs of modules shared a greater number of one-to-one orthologues than expected from a random distribution.</title><p>Error bars indicate the standard deviation.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-107449-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>This analysis did not detect any correlation between the degree of sequence conservation of orthologues in a module and the degree of conservation of the module between <italic>Ectocarpus</italic> species 7 and <italic>D. dichotoma</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments</p><p>(1) Line 650 loose should be lose.</p></disp-quote><p>The error has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Line 695 filtered through a 1 μm filter to remove multicellular gametophyte fractions.

Indeed, it was recently shown that gene expression patterns in developing embryos of Fucus spp. obey the &quot;hourglass&quot; pattern whereby gene expression shows a minima of transcription age index (i.e., higher expression of evolutionarily older genes) associated with differentiation at the phylotypic stage. I am somewhat surprised that the manuscript does not consider this feature in the analysis or discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Brown algae of the order Fucales have diploid life cycles and therefore do not alternate between a sporophyte and gametophyte generation. It is for this reason that we thought that it was more interesting to compare <italic>Ectocarpus</italic> species 7 with <italic>D. dichotoma</italic>, which has a haploid-diploid life cycle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In Discussion, the comparison of maternal to zygote transition in animals and land plants, which show a high degree of dimorphism, with Ectocarpus would be strengthened by data/discussion from other brown algae that show a high degree of dimorphism.</p></disp-quote><p>Animals have diploid life cycles and dimorphism in that lineage generally refers to sexual rather than generational dimorphism. Land plants do have highly dimorphic haploiddiploid life cycles but it is unclear how this characteristic relates to events that occur during the maternal to zygote transition. In Ectocarpus, the transition from gamete to the first stages of sporophyte development involved more marked changes in gene expression than we observed when comparing the mature sporophyte and gametophyte generations (Figure 3C). At present, there is no evidence that events during these two transitions are correlated. The relationship between changes in gene expression during very early sporophyte development and during alternation of life cycle generations could be investigated further using a highly dimorphic kelp model system such as <italic>Saccharina latissima</italic> but we are not aware of any studies that have specifically addressed this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Since marked changes were observed during the transition from gamete to early sporophyte in Ectocarpus, it would be interesting to know how gene expression patterns change during the transition from gamete to partheno-sporophyte. Would the same patterns of downregulation and upregulation be expected?</p></disp-quote><p>The sporophyte individuals derived from gamete parthenogenesis (parthenosporophytes) are indistinguishable morphologically and functionally from diploid sporophytes derived from gamete fusions (see line 76). They also express generation marker genes in a comparable manner (Peters <italic>et al</italic>., 2008). Based on these observations, we have treated partheno-sporophytes and diploid sporophytes as equivalent in our experiments. For clarity, we have now distinguished partheno-sporophyte from diploid sporophyte samples in Table S1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors show a correlation between the degree of dimorphism and generation-biased or generation-specific expression. How was the degree of dimorphism quantified?</p></disp-quote><p>The degree of dimorphism is illustrated in Figure S1 using the relative size of the two generations as a proxy. Size estimations are approximate because the size of an individual of a particular species is quite variable but the ten species nonetheless represent a very clear gradient of dimorphism due to the extreme differences in size between generations of species at each end of the scale, with the sporophyte generation being several orders of magnitude larger than the gametophyte generation or visa versa.</p><p>References</p><p>Arun A, Peters NT, Scornet D, Peters AF, Cock JM, Coelho SM. 2013.
