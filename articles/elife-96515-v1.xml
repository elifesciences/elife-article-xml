Such fundamental cognitive ability relies on a neural circuit, including the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), connected to several cortical areas, functionally and anatomically, namely primary visual areas, and higher cognitive areas such as the cingulate, midcingulate, and subicular cortices. RSC bears intimate anatomical and functional connections with the hippocampus and has been implicated in integrating and translating spatial-temporal contextual information between ego- and allocentric reference frames to compute predictions about goals in goal-directed behaviors. The relative contribution of the hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex in working memory-guided behaviors remains unclear due to the lack of studies reversibly interfering with synapses connecting the two regions during such behaviors. We here used eArch3.0, a hyperpolarizing proton pump, to silence hippocampal axon terminals in RSC while animals perform a standard delayed non-match to place task. We found that such manipulation impairs memory retrieval, significantly decreasing performance and hastening decision-making. Furthermore, we found that such impairment outlasts light activation of the opsin, its effects being noticed up to three subsequent trials.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>retrosplenial cortex</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>synaptic terminals</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>spatial working memory</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PD/BD/128107/2016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pinto-Correia</surname><given-names>Bárbara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IF/00201/2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Remondes</surname><given-names>Miguel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.54499/COVID/BD/151601/2021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pinto-Correia</surname><given-names>Bárbara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PTDC/MED-NEU/29325/2017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Remondes</surname><given-names>Miguel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022.00811.CEECIND</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Remondes</surname><given-names>Miguel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Light-activating a proton pump (eArchT) to silence hippocampal synaptic terminals in the rodent retrosplenial cortex caused a spatial working memory impairment affecting interleaved trials where no light was delivered.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ability to guide behavior according to knowledge stored previously in memory lies at the heart of adaptive behavior and is essential for survival. A crucial aspect of adaptive behavior is the capacity to make decisions based on the spatial structure of the surrounding context, something globally known as spatial cognition or spatial goal-directed behavior. Such cognitive function starts with the selection of relevant information from a flood of sensory stimuli and ends with its storage in cortico-hippocampal circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Morris et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nadel, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Scoville and Milner, 1957</xref>) ultimately as a cognitive map manifested in a vast repertoire of neural activity, selective to multiple ego- (self-referenced) and allocentric (world-referenced) spatial variables, the seminal example of which is the existence of hippocampal place-selective neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">O’Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971</xref>). To allow for the planning of the movements necessary to reach an intended goal, all the while ensuring that body actions are consistent with the context acted upon, a mechanism must exist that reinstates (retrieves) allocentric contextual representations, stored in the hippocampus (HIPP) as spatial memories, aligned to the animal’s viewpoint, e.g., from an egocentric perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bicanski and Burgess, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carstensen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gomez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gomez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Michelmann et al., 2020</xref>). In such a circuit, the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) emerges as a cornerstone, encoding contextual variables in both ego- and allocentric reference frames, representing future spatial goals, and effectively anchoring spatial memory-dependent decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alexander et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander and Nitz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carstensen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carstensen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gomez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gomez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Michelmann et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nitzan et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Despite this remarkable work, we are yet to determine which neural pathways convey allocentric-referenced information stored in the HIPP, through hypothetical recall and egocentric referencing in RSC, onto the anterior midline cingulate (CG) and medial prefrontal cortical areas, responsible for planning motor behavior according to previous events, present needs, and motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akam et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown and Braver, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cowen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Miller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sober and Sabes, 2003</xref>). We have recently found that HIPP axons target the divisions of the medial mesocortex: CG, midcingulate, and RSC, according to a gradient, in which RSC receives a combination of anatomically and functionally distinct inhibitory and excitatory functional synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferreira-Fernandes et al., 2019</xref>), whose manipulation results in specific behavioral deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yamawaki et al., 2019</xref>). We hypothesize that these direct connections between hippocampal CA1 and RSC convey recently encoded and recalled memories to the relevant medial mesocortical regions.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we used the delayed non-match to place (DNMP) task, a spatial working memory (WM) task that requires animals to retrieve the memory of a previous decision, and of the time it occurred, to disambiguate it from similar, previously rewarded, decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggleton et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Maguire, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shaw and Aggleton, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shaw et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wilson et al., 2013</xref>). We then used optogenetics to reversibly interrupt synaptic transmission between HIPP and RSC neurons during the retrieval phase of the DNMP task. Optogenetics uses light-activated membrane-bound molecules with the capacity to sustain and reversibly change neuronal membrane potential through various molecular mechanisms, namely opening ion channels or pumping ions across the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fenno et al., 2011</xref>), to excite or silence groups of neurons with behavior-specific temporal accuracy. As far as it is known, optogenetics is the only molecular technique allowing for reversible perturbation of neural activity within the time constants of the cognitive functions at play during WM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yamamoto et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To test the hypothesis that HIPP inputs onto RSC carry contextual information necessary for DNMP performance and are thus necessary for spatial WM, we used the optogenetic neural silencer eArch3.0 expressed in hippocampal neurons via local injection of an anterograde, static, viral vector (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Saleeba et al., 2019</xref>), AAV5-hSyn1-eArch3.0, under a pan-neuronal promoter, or its ‘empty’ counterpart with only YFP, in adult male Long-Evans rats previously trained in DNMP to 75% performance. We then ran multiple 28-trial DNMP sessions, in which we randomly interleaved two types of trials: no-illumination (NI) or illumination during the test, or retrieval, phase (TI), with green (525 nm) light delivered via two diagonal, intra-cerebral lambda fiber-optic implants, longitudinally staggered such as to deliver light to the full extent of RSC. In each animal, we measured three performance variables: individual trial (error/correct) and global performance (% correct trials), response latency to the choice point, and time spent at the choice point. We then used multivariable generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) using the above categorical and continuous variables to investigate the impact of silencing hippocampal synapses onto RSC neurons in spatial WM-dependent behavior.</p><p>If indeed the HIPP input onto RSC neurons anchors the decisions during ‘test’ runs to the memory of the ‘sample’ runs, we predict that by silencing HIPP inputs in RSC, we will prevent the transfer of information previously encoded in HIPP, and thus hinder the mechanism allowing RSC to inform the correct trajectory during the ‘test’ run, resulting in lower performance, specifically in eArch+ animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Injection of AAV-5-hSyn1-eArch3.0 results in significant expression of a fluorescent tag in RSC hippocampal terminals</title><p>Besides abundant expression of both eArch and CTRL transgenes in hippocampal CA1, we found highly significant expression in the RSC layers as previously reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1A—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferreira-Fernandes et al., 2019</xref>). We could observe that HIPP axon terminals are distributed with high density in the superficial RSC layers II–III, as well as in deeper layer V, and sparsely on all other layers, forming beads-on-a-string structures, typical of axon terminals establishing synapses.

As such, to make sure all behavioral alterations observed during light delivery and opsin activation are due solely to this mechanism, it is imperative that pre-illumination DNMP testing is run under the same conditions as those used while we silence RSC-HIPP axon terminals, except for light delivery. The DNMP task includes a sample (encoding) phase, a delay (memory retention) period, and a choice (retrieval) phase, on a T-shaped maze apparatus. During the sample run, animals are rewarded for running the only available arm, with the alternative arm being blocked. This is followed by the delay period, and the ‘test’ (retrieval) run, during which both arms are made available, and animals are rewarded for choosing the arm previously blocked (i.e. ‘not matching’ the arm sampled previously).</p><p>We thus ran the DNMP protocol in two groups of animals expressing either AAV-5-hSyn1-eArch3.0 (eArch+) or an empty construct (CTRL) AAV-5-hSyn1-YFP, with fiber-optic stubs surgically implanted, and patch cords attached to the fiber-optic stubs, no light being delivered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>).

In these sessions, we observed a significant difference between eArch+ and CTRL animals, with an overall lower performance in eArch+ animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>, GLMM, p=0.006, Bonferroni post hoc test). In addition, we found that the ratio of correct trials in the TI and NI trial groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A and B</xref>) was both significantly different from baseline levels (p&lt;0.001), and from their CTRL counterparts (TI, p=0.02, NI, p=0.008), whose performance did not differ from baseline (p=0.252, p=0.184). The fact that more errors were committed in both TI and NI trials of an illuminated session, but only in eArch+ animals, being absent from CTRL animals, implies two things: first, the effect we observe is not the result of light alone acting upon neurons, an effect described earlier in striatal medium spiny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Owen et al., 2019</xref>) and CG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stujenske et al., 2015</xref>); second, the effects of eArch light activation of hippocampal inputs onto RSC neurons <italic>outlasted illumination</italic>, affecting subsequent NI trials. We were surprised by this result, as it indicates that the effects of eArch activation on either, or both, the neurophysiology of HIPP-RSC synapses and the ensuing circuit mechanisms involved in DNMP last longer than would be expected. To directly address this possibility, we analyzed the probability of animals committing errors after illuminated trials. We observed that, overall, illuminated trials were followed by a decreased probability of correct trials on eArch+, but not CTRL, animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1D</xref>, p=0.015).

Thus, both neural activity and behavior of interleaved non-illuminated trials are affected by the activation of the opsin in illuminated trials, leading authors to hypothesize that such persistent disruption of temporal coding in light-off trials is caused by synaptic plasticity events largely specific to the neural activity taking place in the (previous) epoch where light is delivered.</p><p>Our findings also imply that the notion of millisecond time-resolved neuron silencing using eArch is not applicable to synaptic transmission and, by consequence, to the ensuing behavioral effects we now investigate.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Contrary to CTRL animals, eArch+ animals do not correct course following an incorrect decision in illuminated sessions</title><p>A fundamental principle of learning theory, and a common empirical finding in reward-based learning experiments, is that following an error in which reward is withheld, animals will correct their course of action. Conversely, following a correct decision, which is rewarded, animals maintain their course of action. This behavior is presumably informed by the association of the previous action with resulting outcome, which they store in memory for the next trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mizumori and Jo, 2013</xref>). Under this assumption, we predict that in eArch+, but not CTRL animals, illuminated trials will be followed by persistently defective HIPP-RSC synaptic function, presumably preventing subsequent decisions from anchoring themselves to the previous action-outcome association, even in the absence of light delivery, resulting in a higher probability of errors. To test such prediction, we analyzed the probability of an error trial following error, in illuminated sessions, and found that it is significantly higher in eArch+ animals than in CTRL animals, regardless of whether the present trial is itself illuminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1E</xref>, p&lt;0.001, Bonferroni post hoc test).

We thus sought to determine how long would such an effect last. According to existing literature, once expressed in CA3-CA1 synaptic terminals, illumination of Arch with green-yellow light results in its activation into a powerful outward-moving proton pump, effectively hyperpolarizing neurons, independent of local membrane voltage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Krol et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Miao et al., 2015</xref>). Besides this effect, eArch was recently found to reduce the amplitude and slope of fEPSP from right after the onset to over 2 min after illumination offset, via a pH increase that is independent of hyperpolarization, and to cause a sustained decrease in synaptic vesicle release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">El-Gaby et al., 2016</xref>). Such sustained alkalinization, specific to synaptic boutons, lasts for several minutes post-activation of eArch and has been replicated on striatal-cortical synapses as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mahn et al., 2016</xref>). This previous data reporting the effects of eArch activation led us to further investigate, in our experimental conditions, how far in time would eArch behavioral effects last. We thus asked the following question: if one trial is illuminated, how many subsequent trials will be affected? To answer this question, we computed the probability of a correct trial on trial t+1, t+2, t+3, and t+4, following every illuminated trial. Our previous data shows that, overall, non-illuminated trials suffer the effects of illumination, resulting in more errors. However, by selecting the second previous and third previous trial as a trigger for our analysis, we will be biasing our analysis to include a few sequences of one or two interleaved non-illuminated trials, thus possibly attenuating the silencing effect. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1G</xref>), the probability of a trial being correct is lower in eArch+, compared to CTRL animals, whenever TI happens in the previous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> T-1, p=0.01, Bonferroni post hoc test), the second previous (T-2, p=0.033), and the third previous trial (T-3, p=0.036), such difference becoming nonsignificant on condition T-4, when the fourth previous trial was illuminated (T-4, p=0.078). Considering that the inter-trial interval (ITI) is circa 20 s, we can reasonably estimate that some non-illuminated trials occurred between this and the n-previous illuminated one, and that, despite this, the effects of eArch activation are still present, hence after ~3 min. To try and analyze these effects in more detail, without decreasing the sample size to non-interpretable numbers, we quantified performance specifically following sequences of two consecutively non-illuminated trials. We found that after such sequences, there is still a significant impairment in eArch+ animals, in agreement with the previous analysis and with the notion that the effects of eArch silencing outlast its activation by light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, p=0.023, Mann-Whitney U).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Behavioral impairments resulting from optogenetic silencing of hippocampus (HIPP) terminals in retrosplenial cortex (RSC) outlast illumination.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) eArch+ animals exhibit decreased performance once silencing occurred at T-1 (p=0.01, Bonferroni post hoc test), T-2 (p=0.033), T-3 (p=0.036), not T-4 (p=0.078).

We found that such manipulation significantly decreased spatial WM performance. Interestingly, we found that the effect of hippocampal terminal silencing in RSC during test trials affects interleaved trials during which no light is delivered, thus spreading beyond illumination. We explored this effect further and found that eArch activation lowers performance down to the subsequent three non-illuminated trials, but also that it decreases error-corrective behavior, in which animals use action-outcome information after an error trial (i.e. absence of reward), to correct course in the subsequent trial. Such a prolonged effect finds a precedent in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Robinson et al., 2017</xref>) in which silencing entorhinal-HIPP circuits during WM trials results in lower performance in subsequent non-illuminated trials, suggesting that a possible short- to mid-term neural plasticity event disrupts a key process at play during retrieval. Such an event might be related to recent findings showing that eArch activation in CA3-CA1 synaptic responses in vitro hyperpolarizes neurons independent of local membrane voltage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Krol et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Miao et al., 2015</xref>), reducing the amplitude and slope of recorded fEPSP for over 2 min after illumination offset. This effect is achieved by a pH increase that causes a sustained decrease in synaptic efficacy, with lower vesicle release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">El-Gaby et al., 2016</xref>) at synaptic boutons, replicated on another study using striatal-cortical synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mahn et al., 2016</xref>). We believe such might be the mechanism behind the above-mentioned synaptic plasticity event. These findings imply that the temporal resolution of optogenetic neuron silencing, with neurons effectively unable to generate action potentials, cannot be generalized to the distinct realm of synaptic transmission. Rather, the effects of optogenetics in synaptic physiology might permeate into the synaptic plasticity mechanisms underlying memory acquisition and retrieval.</p><p>Finally, as we have seen before with optogenetic silencing of CG neurons during DNMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cruz et al., 2023</xref>), we found that eArch+ animals spend less time at the choice point compared to CTRL. This behavior is in line with hastier, more erroneous, decisions. In CTRL animals specifically, correct trials are characterized by an increased delay at the choice point, as if the correct decision process took place here. This is consistent with previous findings placing the behavioral decision at an equivalent stage in a continuous alternation task, sensitive to RSC permanent lesions, where goal locations are progressively encoded by RSC.</p><p>In sum, by reversibly silencing the HIPP synaptic inputs to RSC, we have shown that silencing this input affects spatial WM, possibly via changes in synaptic mechanisms conveying memorized contextual and episodic information about past decisions and action-outcome associations onto medial mesocortical executive decision centers.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Rats</title><p>We used 16 (8 eArch and 8 CTRL) male Long-Evans rats aged 4–6 months and weighing 430–600 g (Charles River Laboratories), housed individually and kept under a 12 hr light/dark cycle, gradually deprived to 80–85% of their free-feeding body weight.

Viral titers were 4.4×10<sup>12</sup> vg/ml and 3.3×10<sup>12</sup> vg/ml, respectively. Before surgery, animals were placed in an induction chamber saturated with 5% isoflurane until absence of the righting reflex. Once the animals were deeply anesthetized, they were weighed and transferred to a heating pad. An intraperitoneal injection of a ketamine (37.5 mg/kg) and medetomidine (0.5 mg/kg) cocktail (½ dose) was administered, as well as a subcutaneous injection of carprofen (5 mg/kg, ½ dose), and Ringer’s lactate every hour to maintain hydration levels. The heads were shaved, lidocaine applied to the ears, and eyes covered with a protection gel (Lubrithal) to prevent drying of the cornea. The animals were installed in the stereotaxic frame secured by ear bars. Anesthesia was maintained with 1–3% isoflurane in oxygen until the end of the procedure. Once animals were placed on the frame, the surgical site was scrubbed with 10% povidone-iodine alternated with 70% ethanol three times before an incision was made to expose the skull. Bregma and lambda were carefully identified and marked on the skull surface. These two landmarks were used to level the skull dorsoventrally.

The latter was drilled in an oval shape covering the fiber-optic stub implantation coordinates (−3, +1), (−5, –1). Loose bone pieces were carefully removed with tweezers.

Once each injection was done, the micropipette was left in place for 10 min before being slowly retracted.

the difference between the timestamps of choice point entry and exit. An additional 10 cm was added to the region of interest to account for instances when the rat was stationary but engaged in head poking. Time values were log-transformed to achieve a Gaussian distribution. Normalization to the baseline of log-transformed time in the choice point to the baseline was computed as: [log(latency) – log(baseline mean)]/[log(baseline mean)]. Outliers in time data were identified as values deviating by 2 standard deviations (SD) from the mean and were subsequently removed.</p><p>GLMMs were employed to analyze the results. Model selection was based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC), with the chosen model being the one that converged and exhibited the lowest AIC value. The normality of a distribution was assessed using the Shapiro test along with assessment of residuals using quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots. All the analysis was conducted in Jamovi with the GAMLJ package.</p><p>To assess baseline performance differences between eArch and CTRL groups, we used a GLMM with a binomial distribution and logit link function, with individual subjects (i.e. rats) as the random effects variable. The same GLMM, followed by a Bonferroni post hoc test, was conducted to analyze the ratio of correct trials between groups during the experiment and to assess the trial history effect of illumination. The same tests were used to analyze the trial history effect of errors, using as random effect variables the ‘session number’ and ‘run number’. To compare the groups after two consecutive illuminated trials, a Mann-Whitney U test was applied. For analyzing log time in the choice point, a GLMM with a Gaussian distribution and identity link function was applied, considering rat as the random effects variable. To determine significant differences between groups, we used the Wald chi-square test, and for differences between groups and illumination condition, we used simple effects parameter estimates.

The significance of findings elucidating the role of hippocampal projections to the retrosplenial cortex in memory and decision-making behaviors is important. However, the strength of evidence for the paper's claims is currently incomplete.</p><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a study on the role of the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) and the hippocampus in working memory. Working memory is a critical cognitive function that allows temporary retention of information for task execution. The RSC, which is functionally and anatomically connected to both primary sensory (especially visual) and higher cognitive areas, plays a key role in integrating spatial-temporal context and in goal-directed behaviors. However, the specific contributions of the RSC and the hippocampus in working memory-guided behaviors are not fully understood due to a lack of studies that experimentally disrupt the connection between these two regions during such behaviors.</p><p>In this study, researchers employed eArch3.0 to silence hippocampal axon terminals in the RSC, aiming to explore the roles of these brain regions in working memory. Experiments were conducted where animals with silenced hippocampal axon terminals in the RSC performed a delayed non-match to place (DNMP) task. The results indicated that this manipulation impaired memory retrieval, leading to decreased performance and quicker decision-making in the animals. Notably, the authors observed that the effects of this impairment persisted beyond the light-activation period of the opsin, affecting up to three subsequent trials. They suggest that disrupting the hippocampal-RSC connection has a significant and lasting impact on working memory performance.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>They conducted a study exploring the impact of direct hippocampal inputs into the RSC, a region involved in encoding spatial-temporal context and transferring contextual information, on spatial working memory tasks. Utilizing eArch3.0 expressed in hippocampal neurons via the viral vector AAV5-hSyn1-eArch3.0, they aimed to bilaterally silence hippocampal terminals located at the RSC in rats pre-trained in a DNMP task. They discovered that silencing hippocampal terminals in the RSC significantly decreased working memory performance in eArch+ animals, especially during task interleaving sessions (TI) that alternated between trials with and without light delivery. This effect persisted even in non-illuminated trials, indicating a lasting impact beyond the periods of direct manipulation. Additionally, they observed a decreased likelihood of correct responses following TI trials and an increased error rate in eArch+ animals, even after incorrect responses, suggesting an impairment in error-corrective behavior.

Performance on a delayed non-match-to-place task was impaired by such inhibition. The authors also report that inhibition is associated with faster decision-making and that the effects of inhibition can be observed over several subsequent trials. The work seems reasonably well done and the role of hippocampal projections to retrosplenial cortex in memory and decision-making is very relevant to multiple fields. However, the work should be expanded in several ways before one can make firm conclusions on the role of this projection in memory and behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer#2 for carefully and critically reading our manuscript, and for the valuable comments provided.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) The work is very singular in its message and the experimentation. Further, the impact of the inhibition on behaviour is very moderate. In this sense, the results do not support the conclusion that the hippocampal projection to retrosplenial cortex is key to working memory in a navigational setting.</p></disp-quote><p>As we have mentioned in response to Reviewer#1, the judged “very moderate” effect stems from a perspective according to which a quantitatively lower effect bears less biological significance for cognition, precluding its consideration as “key” for behaviour. We disagree with this perspective and find it rather reductive for several reasons. Once seen in the context of the animal’s ecology, quantitatively lower impairments in working memory are no less key for this cognitive capacity, and can be life-threatening precisely because of their subtlety, leading the animal to confidently rely on a defective capacity, for such events as remembering the habitual location of a predator, or food source. Furthermore, studies in animal cognition often undertake complete, rather than graded, suppression of a given mechanism (in the same sense as “knocking out” a gene that is relevant for behaviour), leading to a gravelly, rather that gradually, impaired model system, to the point of not allowing a hypothetical causal link to be mechanistically revealed beyond its mere presence.

So rather than weak, we would say the results are statistically significant, and biologically realistic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) There are no experiments examining other types of behavior or working memory. Given that the animals used in the studies could be put through a large number of different tasks, this is surprising. There is no control navigational task. There is no working memory test that is non-spatial. Such results should be presented in order to put the main finding in context.</p></disp-quote><p>It is hard to gainsay this point. The more thorough and complete a behavioural characterization is, the more informative is the study, from every angle you look at it. While we agree that other forms of WM would be quite interesting in this context, we also cannot ignore the fact that DNMP is widely tested as a WM task, one that is biologically plausible, sensitive to perturbations of neural circuitry know to be at play therein, and fully accepted in the field. Faced with the impossibility of running further studies, for lack of additional funding and human resources, we chose to run this task.</p><p>A control navigational task would, in our understanding, be used to assess whether silencing HIPP projections to RSC would affect (spatial?) navigation, rather than WM, thus explaining the observed impairment. To this we have the following to say: Spatial Navigation is a very basic cognitive function, one that relies on body orientation relative to spatial context, on keeping an updated representation of such spatial context, (“alas”, as memory), and on guiding behaviour according to acquired knowledge about spatial context. Some of these functions are integral to spatial working memory, as such, they might indeed be affected.</p><p>Dissecting the determinants of spatial WM is indeed an ongoing effort, one that was not the intention of the current study, but also one that we have very present, in hope we can address in the future.</p><p>A non-spatial WM task would indeed vastly solidify our claims beyond spatial WM, onto WM. We have, for this reason, changed the title of the manuscript which now reads “spatial working memory”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The actual impact of the inhibition on activity in RSP is not provided. While this may not be strictly necessary, it is relevant that the hippocampal projection to RSP includes, and is perhaps dominated by inhibitory inputs. I wonder why the authors chose to manipulate hippocampal inputs to RSP when the subiculum stands as a much stronger source of afferents to RSP and has been shown to exhibit spatial and directional tuning of activity. The points here are that we cannot be sure what the manipulation is really accomplishing in terms of inhibiting RSP activity (perhaps this explains the moderate impact on behavior) and that the effect of inhibiting hippocampal inputs is not an effective means by which to study how RSP is responsive to inputs that reflect environmental locations.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree that neural recordings addressing the effect of silencing on RSC neural activity is relevant. We do wish we could have provided more mechanistic studies, to find out exactly what is Arch activation doing to HIPP-RSC transmission, which neurons are being affected, and thus dissecting its circuit determinants. We have all these goals very present and hope we can address them soon. Subiculum, which we mention in the Introduction, is indeed a key player in this complex circuitry, one whose hypothetical influence is the subject of experimental studies which will certainly reveal many other key elements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The impact of inhibition on trials subsequent to the trial during which optical stimulation was actually supplied seems trivial. The authors themselves point to evidence that activation of the hyperpolarizing proton pump is rather long-lasting in its action. Further, each sample-test trial pairing is independent of the prior or subsequent trials. This finding is presented as a major finding of the work, but would normally be relegated to supplemental data as an expected outcome given the dynamics of the pump when activated.</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree that this finding is “trivial”, and object to the considerations of “normalcy”, which we are left wondering about.</p><p>In lack of neurophysiological experiments (for the reasons stated above) to address this interesting finding, we chose to interpret it in light of (the few) published observations, such being the logical course of action in scientific reporting, given the present circumstances.</p><p>Evidence for such a prolonged effect in the context of behaviour is scarce (to our knowledge only the one we cite in the manuscript). As such, it is highly relevant to report it, and give it the relevance we do in our manuscript, rather than “relegating it to supplementary data”, as the reviewer considers being “normal”.</p><p>In the DNMP task the consecutive sample-test pairs are explicitly not independent, as they are part of the same behavioural session. This is illustrated by the simple phenomenon of learning, namely the intra-session learning curves, and the well-known behavioral trial-history effects. The brain does not simply erase such information during the ITI.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) In the middle of the first paragraph of the discussion, the authors make reference to work showing RSP responses to &quot;contextual information in egocentric and allocentric reference frames&quot;. The citations here are clearly deficient.

Is this staggering pattern randomized or fixed? Additionally, Figure 1C is a bit misleading, as the light distribution pattern from the tapered fibre optic is likely to be more concentrated near the surface of the fibre, rather than spreading widely in a large spherical pattern.</p></disp-quote><p>The staggering is fixed. The elliptical (not spherical) contour in Fig 1C is not meant to convey any quantitative information, but rather to visually orient the reader towards the directions into which light will likely propagate, the effects of which we do not attempt to estimate here. We have made this contour smaller.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 119: The authors demonstrate the viral expression pattern of a representative animal and the overall expression patterns of all other animals in Figure 1 and the Supplementary Figures. However, numerous cases in the Supplementary Figures exhibit viral leakages and strong expressions in adjacent cortical and thalamic areas. Although there is a magnified view of the RSC's expression pattern in Figure 1, authors should show the same way in the supplemental data as well. Additionally, the degree of viral expression in the hippocampal subregions varies substantially across animals. This variation is concerning and impacts the interpretation of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>The viral construct was injected in the HIPP at coordinates based on our previous work (Ferreira-Fernandes et al., 2019) wherein injections of a similar vector in mid-dorsal HIPP resulted in widespread expression throughout the medial mesocortex AP extent, RSC through CG, as well as other areas in which HIPP establishes synapses. These were studied in detail then, by estimating the density of axon terminals. In the present work we did not acquire high-mag images of all slices, since they were too expensive, and we had this information from the study above. Still, we have now added further examples of high-mag images taken from eArch and CTRL animals.</p><p>We believe it is important here to mention the fact that the virus we use, AAV5, only travels anterograde and is static (i.e. it does not travel transynaptically).</p><p>Variations in viral expression are to be expected even if injections happen in the exact same way. It is crucial then, that fibre positioning is constant across animals, to guarantee that its relationship with viral expression is thence consistent, and to render irrelevant whatever off-target expression of the viral construct. We have ascertained this condition post-mortem in all our animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 124: Another point regarding the viral expressions and optical fibre implants used to inhibit the HIPP-RSC pathway is that the RSC and HIPP extend substantially along the anterior-posterior axis. The authors should demonstrate how the viral expression is distributed along this axis and indicate where the tip of the tapered optical fibre ended by marking it in the histological images. This information is crucial to confirm the authors' claim that the hippocampal projection terminals were indeed modulated by optical light. Also, the manuscript would benefit from details about the power/duration and/or modulation of the light used.</p></disp-quote><p>In both Figures 1 and S1 panels we can clearly see the tracks formed by the fibres. This provides examples of such dual angle placement vis a vis the expression of the construct, demonstrating that the former is fully targeted towards the latter. We have added markers to highlight these tracks and an example of a “full” track in figure S1. We did not have animals deviating from this relative positioning to any significant extent. The methods section mentions illumination power as 240mA, and we have now added estimated illumination time as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 141: The authors should include data on task performance during learning and baseline sessions for each animal, to demonstrate that they fully grasped the task rules and that achieving a 75% performance ratio was sufficient.</p></disp-quote><p>DNMP is a standard WM task used for many decades, in which animals reach performances above 75% in 4-8 sessions. We have used it extensively, and never saw any deviations from this learning rate and curve. We ran daily sessions until animals reached 75%, and thereafter until they maintained this performance, or above, for three consecutive sessions (the data points we show). We saw no deviations from what is published, nor from what is our own extensive experience, and thence are fully confident that all animals included in this manuscript grasped task rules.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 146: While the study focused on inhibiting inputs during the test run (retrieval phase), it would be beneficial to also inhibit inputs during the sample run (encoding phase) and the delay period. This would help confirm whether the silencing affects only working memory retrieval, or if it also impacts encoding and maintenance.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, it would be very interesting to determine if there are any effects of silencing HIPP RSC terminals during Sample. However, since there is a limit to the number of trials per session, and to the total number of sessions, we could not run the three manipulations within each session of our experimental design, as that would lower the number of trials per condition to an extent that would affect statistical power. Silencing HIPP RSC terminals during Sample would best be a separate experiment, asking a different question, and perhaps within an experimental design distinct from the one envisioned.</p><p>A very important point here relates to the fact that the effects of optogenetic manipulation do not limit themselves to the illumination epoch, in fact they extend far beyond onto the 3rd trial post-illumination. The insertion of Sample-illuminated trials interleaved in the same session would fundamentally affect the interpretation of experimental results, as we could not attribute lower performances to the effects in either or both manipulated epochs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 225: Figure 5 illustrates that silencing the inputs results in an extended impairment of working memory performance. However, it's unclear if there are any behavioural changes during the sample run. The inhibition could potentially affect encoding in the subsequent sample run, considering the inter-trial interval (ITI) is only 20 seconds.</p></disp-quote><p>From the observation of behaviour and the analysis of our data, we saw no overt “behavioural changes during the sample run”, as latencies and speeds were essentially unchanged.</p><p>If what is meant by your comment is the effect of optogenetic manipulation being protracted from the Test towards the Sample epoch, we find this unlikely. Conservatively, we estimate the peak of our optogenetic manipulation to occur around the time light is delivered, the Test phase, rather than 20-30 secs later.</p><p>In theory, any effect of optogenetic silencing of HIPP terminals in RSC can cause disturbances in encoding or Sample, the ITI itself, and the epoch in which mnemonic information retrieved from the Sample epoch is confronted with the contextual information present during Test, leading to a decision. This is regardless of the illumination epoch, and even if the effect of optogenetic manipulation is not prolonged in time.</p><p>Since in our experiments we specifically target the Test epoch, and there is, in all likelihood, a decaying magnitude of neurophysiological effects, manifest in the reported decaying nature of the manipulation mechanism, and in our observed decrease of behavioural proficiency from subsequent trials 1:4, we are convinced that a conservative interpretation is that our major effect is concentrated in the epoch in which we deliver light - the Test epoch, the consequences of which (possibly related to short term plasticity events taking place within the HIPP-RSC neural circuit) extending further in time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 410: The methods section on the surgical procedure could be clearer, particularly regarding the coordinates for microinjection and fibre implantation.

The extent of the discussion of ego vs allo-centric variables in our manuscript might venture a bit out of the main subject. It was included to provide wider context to our reporting of the data, considering that spatial working memory is indeed one instance in which egocentric- and allocentric-referenced cognitive mechanisms confront each other, and one in which silencing the HIPP input to a cortical region thence involved would likely disturb ensuing computations.
