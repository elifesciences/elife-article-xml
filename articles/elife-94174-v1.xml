early stages of life’s origin. Ancient protein families have been found to share common themes and proteins reduced in composition to prebiotically plausible amino acids have been reported capable of structure formation and key functions, such as binding to RNA. While this may suggest peptide relevance in early life, their functional repertoire, when composed of a limited number of early residues (missing some of the most sophisticated functional groups of today’s alphabet) has been debated. Cofactors enrich the functional scope of about half of extant enzymes, but whether they could also bind to peptides lacking the evolutionary late amino acids remains speculative. The aim of this study was to resolve the early peptide propensity to bind organic cofactors by analysis of protein-coenzyme interactions across the Protein Data Bank (PDB). We find that the prebiotically plausible amino acids are more abundant in the binding sites of the most ancient coenzymes and that such interactions rely more frequently on the involvement of the protein backbone atoms and metal ion cofactors. Moreover, we have identified a few select examples in today’s enzymes where coenzyme binding is supported solely by prebiotically available amino acids. These results imply the plausibility of a coenzyme-peptide functional collaboration preceding the establishment of the Central Dogma and full protein alphabet evolution.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein evolution</kwd><kwd>peptides</kwd><kwd>coenzymes</kwd><kwd>genetic code evolution</kwd><kwd>amino acid alphabet</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>MEYS CR</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LM20230</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Novotný</surname><given-names>Marian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02ebx7v45</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.52044/HFSP.RGEC272023.pc.gr.168579</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hlouchová</surname><given-names>Klára</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/024d6js02</institution-id><institution>Grant Schemes at CU</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CZ.02.2.69/0.0/0.0/19_073/0016935</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sanchez Rocha</surname><given-names>Alma Carolina</given-names></name><name><surname>Makarov</surname><given-names>Mikhail</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Amino acids that were abundant since the prebiotic era are enriched in protein binding sites of the most ancient coenzymes, supporting the plausibility of an early coenzyme–peptide world.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Organic and inorganic cofactors occupy about half of all known protein structures, expanding across all the enzyme E.C. classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Putignano et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2019</xref>). While their role in current life is indisputable, some of the cofactors were present and apparently crucial also during life’s early evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chu and Zhang, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goldman and Kacar, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kirschning, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fried et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kirschning, 2022</xref>). The significance of metal ions has been broadly discussed, regardless of the different origins-of-life scenarios, and has somewhat overshadowed that of organic cofactors (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wächtershäuser, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Russell and Hall, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lane and Martin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chu and Zhang, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fried et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Diverse lines of evidence have, however, indicated that many of the extant organic cofactors (coenzymes) date back to the earliest life, while their core chemistries have been detected in abiotic material, such as recently reported by the Hayabusa2 mission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Holliday et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fried et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Naraoka et al., 2023</xref>). At the same time, these ancient coenzymes – often of nucleotide origin– have been traced to the most ancient protein folds (such as P-loop NTPases, TIM beta/alpha-barrels, OB, and Rossmann folds) that date before the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goldman and Kacar, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caetano-Anollés et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goldman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Longo et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kessel and Ben-Tal, 2022</xref>). Within the most ancient folds, tens of peptide fragments/themes have been identified throughout seemingly unrelated structural domains and frequently found to mediate ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Söding and Lupas, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Laurino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kolodny et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nepomnyachiy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Qiu et al., 2022</xref>). Such themes may well represent the remnants of protoenzymes in a peptide-nucleotide world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fried et al., 2022</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chu and Zhang, 2020</xref> recently proposed that cofactors could initially ‘select’ the earliest primitive proteins from the vast sequence space by the ability to bind them. More generally, binding of cofactors to peptides could thus determine the evolution of both protoenzyme function and folding preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tokuriki and Tawfik, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Prior to the fixation of the Central Dogma and ribosomal synthesis, peptides would condense from amino acids (or their alternatives) prebiotically abundant in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frenkel-Pinter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frenkel-Pinter et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fried et al., 2022</xref>). Independent meta-analyses of the amino acid alphabet evolution based on different possible sources of organic material and different disciplines point towards an ‘early alphabet’ of ~10 residues (Ala, Asp, Glu, Gly, Ile, Leu, Pro, Ser, Thr, and Val) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Higgs and Pudritz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Trifonov, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cleaves, 2010</xref>). These could be supplemented by other prebiotically plausible non-canonical amino acids, while the other half of the canonical alphabet is assumed to be the product of later biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wong and Bronskill, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Weber and Miller, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zaia et al., 2008</xref>). Typically, the early amino acids (canonical as well as non-canonical) are smaller and less complex, missing e.g., sulfur groups and aromatics. Additionally, the canonical early alphabet lacks positively charged residues. An emerging question, therefore, is whether coenzymes could bind to small proteins of prebiotic relevance and whether they could be bound by the prebiotically available residues. In such a scenario, cofactors would provide a palette of functional groups to the early peptide world, which would nominate them relatively sophisticated structural and catalytic hubs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Milner-White and Russell, 2011</xref>). Alternatively, if coenzymes could not be bound by these simple amino acids, this would suggest that their pairing with peptide molecules would become relevant only after the evolution of the full amino acid alphabet.</p><p>Work from our group and others has recently demonstrated that in select cases, protein sequences re-engineered from the early amino acids can still bind to nucleic acid and nucleotide-based cofactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Longo et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Makarov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Giacobelli et al., 2022</xref>). Whether this phenomenon is still seen in today’s biology, its abundance and laws represent open questions. Here, we present a systematic survey of coenzyme binding throughout the PDB database. The outcomes of our study support that the coenzyme binding characteristics of amino acids differ by their evolutionary age. Early amino acids are enriched in binding pockets of the most ancient coenzymes and the interaction relies predominantly on the protein backbone groups. Selected examples show that, unlike evolutionary younger cofactors, the ancient cofactors can still be bound in proteins only by early amino acids. Our analysis, therefore, points to an early peptide-coenzyme significance, preceding the evolution of proteosynthesis and the fixation of the Central Dogma.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of coenzymes in PDB</title><p>We identified all the available structures from the PDB that interact with the 27 coenzyme classes as defined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fischer et al., 2010</xref>.

This coenzyme temporality bears many molecules that are derived from nucleotides (such as ATP, FAD, SAM, and NAD) and is spread throughout all the E.C. classes of protein catalysts. This is the first obvious distinction from the other (less-populated) classes of coenzymes and supports the coenzyme-peptide significance from the earliest life until today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">White, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Narunsky et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>There are several outstanding differences in the properties of binding to proteins among the different coenzyme temporalities. First, the ancient coenzymes bind to proteins more frequently via early amino acids. On average, this interaction presents 61% of all Ancient coenzyme bonds to proteins. It is only 53 and 38% for the LUCA and Post-LUCA coenzymes, respectively.</p><p>While the Ancient nucleotide-derived and Unclassified coenzyme binding sites are dominated by residues in the loop conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), there is also a substantially higher frequency of residues in beta-sheet conformations when compared to Post-LUCA coenzyme sites. Those, on the other hand, are dominated by alpha-helical conformations. Loops exhibit greater sequence variability compared to ordered structures, and their flexible nature enables them to undergo structural changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kessel and Ben-Tal, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tokuriki and Tawfik, 2009</xref>).

The role of loops could thus be important for the flexibility and versatility of early peptide-coenzyme binding sites. It has been noted that evolutionary benefits would be presented by sequences that could adopt closed-loop conformations, providing stability and protection to early coenzymes, and such hubs could truly transition the peptide-coenzyme world towards primordial enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goncearenco and Berezovsky, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gamiz-Arco et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Toledo-Patiño et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gutierrez-Rus et al., 2023</xref>). Besides sequences without regular secondary structure elements, beta-sheets have been considered a more prevalent and significant motif during early stages of protein evolution than alpha helices. Beta sheet represents the first structural motif in models of the ribosomal evolution, and it has also been observed as a mildly enriched motif in sequences formed from early amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brack and Orgel, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lupas and Alva, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kovacs et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tretyachenko et al., 2022</xref>).

A specific example of such a scenario was recently reported, where a dihydrofolate reductase activity was supported purely by protein backbone-coenzyme interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lemay-St-Denis and Pelletier, 2023</xref>). Finally, Longo et al. recently analyzed binding sites of different phosphate-containing ligands, which were arguably of high relevance during the earliest stages of life, connecting all of today’s core metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Longo et al., 2020b</xref>). They observed that, unlike the evolutionary younger binding motifs (which rely on side-chain binding), the most ancient lineages indeed bind to phosphate moieties predominantly via the protein backbone.</p><p>Our analysis assigns this phenomenon primarily to interactions via early amino acids that (as mentioned above) are generally enriched in the binding interface of the Ancient coenzymes. This implies that late amino acids would not necessarily be needed for the sovereignty of coenzyme-peptide interplay. To address this intriguing possibility, we next searched whether there are such examples in the PDB dataset, where coenzymes would be bound exclusively by early amino acids. We found 17 such proteins where all the coenzymes belonged to the Ancient temporality (such as ATP and NAD). Together with all of the above, this finding supports the possibility that peptide-coenzyme functional hubs could have originated before the evolution of the full canonical amino acid alphabet.</p><p>Reinforcing this, we have recently demonstrated on a select example of a ribosomal RNA-binding domain that a negatively charged variant of the protein composed of only early amino acids is indeed capable of binding to RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Giacobelli et al., 2022</xref>). In that case, the interaction is further supported by metal ions that were not present at the binding interface of the wild-type protein. Interestingly, the same trend was observed here throughout the PDB dataset. 24% of the Ancient coenzymes in PDB are additionally mediated by at least one metal ion. LUCA and Post-LUCA coenzymes involved metal ions only in 13 and 11%, respectively. It is quite probable that not all the metal ion densities are recognized or fully resolved in all the PDB structures that were used in our analysis. Nevertheless, we hypothesize that the overall trend can be attributed to the inherent negative charge of many of the Ancient coenzymes, necessitating engagement of positively charged metal ions. This would also be true for direct interaction of early peptides/proteins and metal ions, independent of organic cofactor involvement, as discussed previously by us and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bromberg et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frenkel-Pinter et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fried et al., 2022</xref>). For example, it has been observed that coordination of prebiotically most relevant metal ions (e.g. Mg<sup>2+</sup>) is more often mediated by early amino acids such as Asp and Glu, whereas metal ions of later relevance (e.g. Cu<sup>+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup>) bind more frequently via late amino acids like His and Cys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fried et al., 2022</xref>). Similarly, ancient metal binding folds have been shown to be enriched in early amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bromberg et al., 2022</xref>).

Combining ancestral sequence reconstruction and selection/protein design, short polypeptide motifs capable of poly/nucleotide binding have been recovered from the P-loop NTPase and HhH motifs, relying primarily on early amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Longo et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Romero Romero et al., 2018</xref>).

Provokingly, it has also been implied that many of these motifs emerged initially as polynucleotide binders and started serving catalysis only after gaining higher structural complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Romero Romero et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Our entry search of PDB coenzymes also retrieved 80 RNA structures. While these were not the primary subject of our analysis, the majority of those were found to interact with Ancient coenzymes, mainly the nucleotide-derived ones, such as ATP, FMN, NAD, and SAM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). While some of these structures are assigned as riboswitches, other coenzyme-RNA complexes belong to ribozymes, representing the potential of polynucleotides in early catalysis as discussed by many previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">White, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">White, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gilbert, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reyes-Prieto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goldman and Kacar, 2021</xref>). If peptide-polynucleotide interactions were initially more feasible and dominant (in a putative peptide-polynucleotide world, as implied above), coenzymes could have played a key role in resolving the sovereignty of these molecules towards their tertiary structures and catalytic functions. Polypeptide-coenzyme catalysts would soon dominate in performance (enabling more efficient catalysis) and functional repertoires, especially those that would be hard to facilitate in their absence, such as oxidoreductases and transferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fried et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goldman and Kacar, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kessel and Ben-Tal, 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Limitations of our work</title><p>The first obvious drawback of this analysis is the ambiguity that accompanies the division of coenzymes into evolutionary age temporalities. While the prebiotic availability (or lack of) is quite consensual in some cases, there are also contradictory studies and opinions in the case of some other coenzymes. Some of the coenzymes have, e.g., prebiotic precursors but are not present across all the kingdoms of life. This may suggest that the coenzyme became important only post-LUCA but it can also mean that its importance was only preserved in specific branches of life. ‘Unclassified’ category has been included for such specific cases (presented e.g. by glutathione). Several properties of glutathione that were identified here (such as protein backbone vs. sidechain interaction, ubiquity across all E.C. enzyme classes and a high number of associated X-groups) would suggest that it is closer to Ancient coenzymes. The other ‘classified’ coenzymes were categorized based on prevailing studies, although some ambiguity remains. Despite our efforts, the evolutionary ratings of coenzymes (and amino acids) are, therefore, not always clear-cut and not all belong to the categories with the same weight (e.g. some are likely to be more ancient than others). For example, the nucleotide-derived coenzymes probably predate the others of the Ancient temporality - it has been proposed that S-adenosylmethionine emerged before the more complex heme-related porphyrin adenosylcobalamin or coenzyme B12 functionalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lazcano, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Another possible bias of our study stems from the population differences among the three coenzyme temporalities. The ancient coenzymes are by far the most abundant temporality in the PDB dataset. It can be argued that this is the result of their ~4 billion years of essentiality to life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goldman and Kacar, 2021</xref>). Nevertheless, it may as well be contributed by the bias of structures that are deposited in the PDB and most probably does not reflect the true distribution of coenzymes in the biological protein space. Additionally, the comparison of differentially populated temporalities has challenged some aspects of the analysis presented here, although care has been taken to perform all the appropriate statistical tests.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The findings presented here propose that early (the less complex and prebiotically plausible) amino acids are sufficient for binding to Ancient coenzymes. Consequently, coenzyme-peptide interactions might have been conceivable at a time when the amino acid alphabet was not yet evolved to its current form. In such interactions, binding modes would rely more on the protein backbone atoms and on involvement of metal ions, both of which are less frequent in interactions with evolutionarily young coenzymes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Identification of organic cofactors</title><p>We systematically identified all available cofactor and cofactor-like molecules in the Protein Data Bank in Europe (wwPDB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Varadi et al., 2020</xref>) programmatically through the PDBe REST API (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pdbe-rest-api">pdbe.org/api</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2019</xref>). All cofactor molecules were classified into 27 classes based on the CoFactor database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fischer et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, we included ATP and its analogs as an additional cofactor class.</p><p>The identification of all the available ligand codes from the PDB chemical component dictionary for each cofactor class was achieved by programmatic access through the ‘Cofactors’ endpoint (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/api/pdb/compound/cofactors">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/api/pdb/compound/cofactors</ext-link>) using the PDBe REST API (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pdbe-rest-api">pdbe.org/api</ext-link>) and all responses were in JSON format.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Structural database and classifications</title><p>We retrieved the PDB entries associated with each chemical component from every cofactor class using the ‘PDB entries containing the compound’ endpoint (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/api/pdb/compound/in_pdb/:id">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/api/pdb/compound/in_pdb/:id</ext-link>) via the Entry-based API. The count of PDBe entries for each cofactor class is provided in the supplementary information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The information from the REST API was unavailable for two coenzyme classes, MIO and Orthoquinone, so they were excluded from the analysis.</p><p>The secondary structure assignments and (EC) numbers for all PDB structures analyzed were determined through residue-level cross-references obtained from the SIFTS XML files (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Velankar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dana et al., 2019</xref>). Secondary structure elements include ‘h’ for helix, ‘b’ for strand, and ‘c’ for coil; and they correspond to the information available in the PDBe website. Only observed residues were examined.</p><p>Furthermore, we assigned all our PDB entries to the ECOD hierarchical system groups ‘X,’ ‘H,’ and ‘F’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>UniProt assignment and interaction ratio</title><p>The assignment of UniProt codes to our structural dataset was achieved by mapping the information with the SIFTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Velankar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dana et al., 2019</xref>) file ‘pdb_chain_uniprot.tsv.gz’ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/docs/sifts/quick.html">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/docs/sifts/quick.html</ext-link>). Next, we mapped the UniProt residue to each of the PDB structures with the residue-level cross-reference data of SIFTS by retrieving the XML files (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/docs/sifts/quick.html">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/docs/sifts/quick.html</ext-link>).</p><p>Each UniProt code represents a unique protein sequence that encompasses one or various PDBe-associated entries. With the aim of filtering those residues relevant to the interaction sites at the level of protein sequence, we incorporated the interaction ratio. The interaction ratio is a measure of the interaction for each ligand with all its PDB-associated entries by UniProt residue. Those residue-ligand interactions that were preserved in more than 50% of the associated PDB entries were selected (we call the ratio of preserved interactions among structures of one unique protein interaction ratio).</p><p>Upon UniProt residues assignment for each residue of the PDB structures, we downloaded the calculated interaction ratio with the endpoint ‘<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/graph-api/uniprot/ligand_sites/:accession">UniProt- Get ligand binding residues for a UniProt accession</ext-link>’ .</p><p>The redundancy of our database was removed by clustering the UniProt sequences using CD-HIT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Li and Godzik, 2006</xref>) with a 90% sequence identity parameter.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Analysis of coenzyme interactions</title><p>In order to analyze the amino acid-coenzyme interactions, we used the PDBe Aggregated API (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/graph-api/pdbe_doc/">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/graph-api/pdbe_doc/</ext-link>). For each PDB entry, we first retrieved all bound molecules via the “PDB – Get bound molecule interactions” endpoint of the Aggregated API. We then obtained the ligand interactions for each bound molecule using the “PDB – Get bound ligand interactions” endpoint, also provided by the same Aggregated API, which calculates these interactions with Arpeggio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jubb et al., 2017</xref>). The retrieved interactions included the standard amino acid codes, water molecules, and metal ions.</p><p>We classified all the interactions reported by Arpeggio into nine distinct interaction types. The classification scheme aligns with the one used by PDBe and encompasses the following categories: (i) ‘covalent;’ (ii) ‘electrostatic,’ which combines ‘ionic,’ ‘hbond,’ ‘weak_hbond,’ ‘polar,’ ‘weak_polar,’ ‘xbond’ and ‘carbonyl;’ (iii) ‘amide,’ consisting of ‘AMIDEAMIDE’ and ‘AMIDERING;’ (iv) ‘vdw,’ denoting van der Waals interactions; (v) ‘hydrophobic;’ (vi) ‘aromatic,’ grouping ‘aromatic,’ ‘FF,’ ‘OF,’ ‘EE,’ ‘FT,’ ‘OT,’ ‘ET,’ ‘FE,’ ‘OE,’ and ‘EF’ contacts; (vii) ‘atom-pi,’ comprised of ‘CARBONPI,’ ‘CATIONPI,’ ‘DONORPI,’ ‘HALOGENPI,’ and ‘METSULPHURPI;’ (viii) ‘metal’ and (ix) ‘clashes,’ including ‘clash’ and ‘vdw_clash’ contacts. We have omitted this last category due to the limited number of interactions, most of which result from experimental errors during X-ray diffraction.</p><p>Backbone and side chain interactions were identified based on the atom identities in the coenzyme binding sites. Those atoms corresponding to the backbone of standard amino acids were identified as: ‘N,’ ‘C,’ ‘CA,’ ‘O.’ Glycine has only a hydrogen atom as its side chain; nevertheless, no side chain atom mediating any interaction was identified.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Secondary structure analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis of secondary structure content was conducted at the UniProt level. For each residue within every UniProt entry, we considered all potential secondary structure elements derived from the PDB structures associated with each UniProt code. Subsequently, we eliminated redundancy on a per-residue basis. This methodological approach enabled us to comprehensively encompass the structural diversity at each position of the protein.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Interactions mediated exclusively by early or late amino acids</title><p>To examine proteins that interacted with cofactors solely through early or late amino acids, we filtered the data to include only proteins interacting with at least two amino acids.</p><p>For the assessment of the evolutionary conservation of coenzyme-binding amino acids, we employed ConSurf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashkenazy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashkenazy et al., 2016</xref>).

They infer from this that coenzymes might have played an important role in prebiotic proteins.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The analysis, which is very straightforward, is technically correct. However, the conclusions might not be as strong as presented.</p><p>(2) This paper presents an excellent summary of contemporary thought on what might have constituted prebiotic proteins and their properties.</p><p>(3) The paper is clearly written.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for the kind comments of the reviewer on our manuscript. However, we would like to clarify a possible misunderstanding in the summary of our study. Specifically, analysis of &quot;ancient versus recent folds&quot; was not really reported in our results. Our analysis concerned &quot;coenzyme age&quot; rather than the &quot;protein folds age&quot; and was focused mainly on interaction with early vs. late amino acids in protein sequence. While structural propensities of the coenzyme binding sites were also analyzed, no distinction on the level of ancient vs. recent folds was assumed and this was only commented on in the discussion, based on previous work of others.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The conclusions might not be as strong as presented. First of all, while ancient amino acids interact less frequently in late with a given coenzyme, maybe this just reflects the fact that proteins that evolved later might be using residues that have a more favorable binding free energy.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to point out that there was no distinction between proteins that evolved early or late in our dataset of coenzyme-binding proteins. The aim of our analysis was purely to observe trends in the age of amino acids vs. age of coenzymes. While no direct inference can be made from this about early life as all the proteins are from extant life (as highlighted in the discussion of our work), our goal was to look for intrinsic propensities of early vs. late amino acids in binding to the different coenzyme entities. Indeed, very early interactions would be smeared by the eons of evolutionary history (perhaps also towards more favourable binding free energy, as pointed out also by the reviewer). Nevertheless, significant trends have been recorded across the PDB dataset, pointing to different propensities and mechanistic properties of the binding events. Rather than to a specific evolutionary past, our data therefore point to a “capacity” of the early amino acids to bind certain coenzymes, and we believe that this is the major (and standing) conclusion of our work, along with the properties of such interactions. In our revised version, we will carefully go through all the conclusions and make sure that this message stands out, but we are confident that the following concluding sentences copied from the abstract and the discussion of our manuscript fully comply with our data:</p><p>“These results imply the plausibility of a coenzyme-peptide functional collaboration preceding the establishment of the Central Dogma and full protein alphabet evolution”</p><p>“While no direct inferences about distant evolutionary past can be drawn from the analysis of extant proteins, the principles guiding these interactions can imply their potential prebiotic feasibility and significance.”</p><p>“This implies that late amino acids would not be necessarily needed for the sovereignty of coenzyme-peptide interplay.”</p><p>We would also like to add that proteins that evolved later might not always have higher free energy of binding. Musil et al., 2021 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8294521/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8294521/</ext-link>) showed in their study on the example of haloalkane dehalogenase Dha A that the ancestral sequence reconstruction is a powerful tool for designing more stable, but also more active proteins. Ancestral sequence reconstruction relies on finding ancient states of protein families to suggest mutations that will lead to more stable proteins than are currently existing proteins. Their study did not explore the ligand-protein interactions specifically but showed that ancient states often show more favorable properties than modern proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) What about other small molecules that existed in the probiotic soup? Do they also prefer such ancient amino acids? If so, this might reflect the interaction propensity of specific amino acids rather than the inferred important role of coenzymes.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comment of the reviewer towards other small molecules, which we assume points mainly towards metal ions (i.e. inorganic cofactors). We completely agree with the reviewer that such interactions are of utmost importance to the origins of life. Intentionally, they were not part of our study, as these have already been studied previously by others (e.g. Bromberg et al., 2022; and reviewed in Frenkel-Pinter et al., 2020) and also us (Fried et al., 2022). For example, it is noteworthy that prebiotically relevant metal binding sites (e.g. of Mg2+) exhibit enrichment in early amino acids such as Asp and Glu while more recent metal (e.g. Cu and Zn) site in the late amino acids His and Cys (Fried et al., 2022). At the same time, comparable analyses of amino acid - coenzyme trends were not available.</p><p>Nevertheless, involvement of metal ions in the coenzyme binding sites was also studied here and pointed to their bigger involvement with the Ancient coenzymes. In the revised version of the manuscript, we will be happy to enlarge the discussion of the studies concerning inorganic cofactors.</p><p>The following sentence was added in the discussion of the revised manuscript:</p><p>“This would also be true for direct interaction of early peptides/proteins and metal ions, independent of organic cofactor involvement, as discussed previously by us and others (Bromberg et al., 2022; Frenkel-Pinter et al., 2020; Fried et al., 2022). For example, it has been observed that coordination of prebiotically most relevant metal ions (e.g., Mg2+) is more often mediated by early amino acids such as Asp and Glu, whereas metal ions of later relevance (e.g., Cu and Zn) bind more frequently via late amino acids like His and Cys (Fried et al. 2022). Similarly, ancient metal binding folds have been shown to be enriched in early amino acids (Bromberg et al., 2022).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Perhaps the conclusions just reflect the types of active sites that evolved first and nothing more.</p></disp-quote><p>We partly agree on this point with the reviewer but not on the fact why it is listed as the weakness of our study and on the “nothing more” notion. Understanding what the properties of the earliest binding sites is key to merging the gap between prebiotic chemistry and biochemistry. The potential of peptides preceding ribosomal synthesis (and the full alphabet evolution) along with prebiotically plausible coenzymes addresses exactly this gap, which is currently not understood.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>I enjoyed reading this paper and appreciate the careful analysis performed by the investigators examining whether 'ancient' cofactors are preferentially bound by the first-available amino acids, and whether later 'LUCA' cofactors are bound by the late-arriving amino acids. I've always found this question fascinating as there is a contradiction in inorganic metal-protein complexes (not what is focused on here). Metal coordination of Fe, Ni heavily relies on softer ligands like His and Cys - which are by most models latecomer amino acids. There are no traces of thiols or imidazoles in meteorites - although work by Dvorkin has indicated that could very well be due to acid degradation during extraction. Chris Dupont (PNAS 2005) showed that metal speciation in the early earth (such as proposed by Anbar and prior RJP Williams) matched the purported order of fold emergence.</p><p>As such, cofactor-protein interactions as a driving force for evolution has always made sense to me and I admittedly read this paper biased in its favor. But to make sure, I started to play around with the data that the authors kindly and importantly shared in the supplementary files. Here's what I found:</p><p>Point 1: The correlation between abundance of amino acids and protein age is dominated by glycine.</p><p>There is a small, but visible difference in old vs new amino acid fractional abundance between Ancient and LUCA proteins (Figure 3, Supplementary Table 3). However, the bias is not evenly distributed among the amino acids - which Figure 4A shows but is hard to digest as presented. So instead I used the spreadsheet in Supplement 3 to calculate the fractional difference FDaa = F(old aa)-F(new aa). As expected from Figure 3, the mean FD for Ancient is greater than the mean FD for LUCA. But when you look at the same table for each amino acid FDcofactor = F(ancient cofactor) - F(LUCA cofactor), you now see that the bias is not evenly distributed between older and newer amino acids at all. In fact, most of the difference can be explained by glycine (FDcofactor = 3.8) and the rest by also including tryptophan (FDcofactor = -3.8). If you remove these two amino acids from the analysis, the trend seen in Figure 3 all but disappears.</p><p>Troubling - so you might argue that Gly is the oldest of the old and Trp is the newest of the new so the argument still stands. Unfortunately, Gly is a lot of things - flexible, small, polar - so what is the real correlation, age, or chemistry? This leads to point 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We truly acknowledge the effort that the reviewer made in the revision of the data and for the thoughtful, deeper analysis. We agree that this deserves further discussion of our data.</p><p>As invited by the reviewer, we indeed repeated the analysis on the whole dataset. First, we would like to point out that the reviewer was most probably referring to the Supplementary Fig. 2 (and not 3, which concerns protein folds). While the difference between Ancient and LUCA coenzyme binding is indeed most pronounced for Gly and Trp, we failed to confirm that the trend disappears if those two amino acids are removed from the analysis (additional FDcofactors of 3.2 and -3.2 are observed for the early and late amino acids, resp.), as seen in Table I below. The main additional contributors to this effect are Asp (FD of 2.1) and Ser (FD of 1.8) from the early amino acids and Arg (FD of -2.6) and Cys (FD of -1.7) of the late amino acids. Hence, while we agree with the reviewer that Gly and Trp (the oldest and the youngest) contribute to this effect the most, we disagree that the trend reduces to these two amino acids.</p><p>In addition, the most recent coenzyme temporality (the Post-LUCA) was neglected in the reviewer’s analysis. The difference between F (old) and F (new) is even more pronounced in Post-LUCA than in LUCA, vs. Ancient (Supplementary table 5A) and depends much less on Trp. Meanwhile, Asp, Ser, Leu, Phe, and Arg dominate the observed phenomenon (Supplementary table 5b). This further supports our lack of agreement with the reviewer’s point. Nevertheless, we remain grateful for this discussion and we will happily include this additional analysis in the Supplementary Material of our revised manuscript.</p><p>The following text (and the additional data) was included in the revised manuscript version:</p><p>“To explore the contribution of individual amino acids to this effect, fractional difference (FD) for early vs. late amino acids among the Ancient, LUCA, and Post-LUCA coenzyme binding was calculated (Supplementary Table 5). The mean FD revealed a similar trend to the amino acid composition analysis (Fig. 3). The amino acids most enriched in LUCA vs. Post-LUCA are Gly, Ser, and Leu (FD of 4.4, 4.3, and 4.1 respectively), while the most depleted include Phe, Arg, and His (FD of -11, -4.2, and -3.2) (Supplementary Table 5B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 2 - The correlation is dominated by phosphate.</p><p>In the ancient cofactor list, all but 4 comprise at least one phosphate (SAM, tetrahydrofolic acid, biopterin, and heme). Except for SAM, the rest have very low Gly abundance. The overall high Gly abundance in the ancient enzymes is due to the chemical property of glycine that can occupy the right-hand side of the Ramachandran plot. This allows it to make the alternating alphaleft-alpharight conformation of the P-loop forming Milner-White's anionic nest. If you remove phosphate binding folds from the analysis the trend in Figure 3 vanishes.</p><p>Likewise, Trp is an important functional residue for binding quinones and tuning its redox potential. The LUCA cofactor set is dominated by quinone and derivatives, which likely drives up the new amino acid score for this class of cofactors.</p></disp-quote><p>Once again, we are thankful to the reviewer for raising this point. The role of Gly in the anionic nests proposed by Milner-White and Russel, as well as the Trp role in quinone binding are important points that we would be happy to highlight more in the discussion of the revised manuscript.</p><p>Nevertheless, we disagree that the trends reduce only to the phosphate-containing coenzymes and importantly, that “the trend in Figure 3 vanishes” upon their removal. Supplementary table 6A and 6B show the data for coenzymes excluding those with phosphate moiety and the trend in Fig. 3 remains, albeit less pronounced.</p><p>The following text was included in the revised manuscript version:</p><p>“Moreover, we investigated whether the observed trend in amino acid occurrence at the binding sites was dominated by the presence of phosphate groups, which are common in many ancient cofactors except for SAM, Tetrahydrofolic acid, Biopterin, and Heme. An additional analysis therefore excluded all phosphate-containing coenzymes indicating that while the trend is less pronounced, it remains even in the absence of phosphate groups (Supplementary Table 6).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In summary, while I still believe the premise that cofactors drove the shape of peptides and the folds that came from them - and that Rossmann folds are ancient phosphate-binding proteins, this analysis does not really bring anything new to these ideas that have already been stated by Tawfik/Longo, Milner-White/Russell, and many others.</p><p>I did this analysis ad hoc on a slice of the data the authors provided and could easily have missed something and I encourage the authors to check my work. If it holds up it should be noted that negative results can often be as informative as strong positive ones. I think the signal here is too weak to see in the noise using the current approach.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewer for encouraging further look at our data. While we hope that the analysis on the whole dataset (listed in Tables I - IV) will change the reviewer’s standpoint on our work, we would still like to comment on the questioned novelty of our results. In fact, the extraordinary works by Tawfik/Longo and Milner-While/Russel (which were cited in our manuscript multiple times) presented one of the motivations for this study. We take the opportunity to copy the part of our discussion that specifically highlights the relevance of their studies, and points out the contribution of our work with respect to theirs.</p><p>“While all the coenzymes bind preferentially to protein residue sidechains, more backbone interactions appear in the ancient coenzyme class when compared to others. This supports an earlier hypothesis that functions of the earliest peptides (possibly of variable compositions and lengths) would be performed with the assistance of the main chain atoms rather than their sidechains (Milner-White and Russel 2011). Longo et al., recently analyzed binding sites of different phosphate-containing ligands which were arguably of high relevance during earliest stages of life, connecting all of today’s core metabolism (Longo et al., 2020 (b)). They observed that unlike the evolutionary younger binding motifs (which rely on sidechain binding), the most ancient lineages indeed bind to phosphate moieties predominantly via the protein backbone.</p><p>Our analysis assigns this phenomenon primarily to interactions via early amino acids that (as mentioned above) are generally enriched in the binding interface of the ancient coenzymes. This implies that late amino acids would not be necessarily needed for the sovereignty of coenzyme-peptide interplay.”</p><p>Unlike any other previous work, our study involves all the major coenzymes (not just the phosphate-containing ones) and is based on their evolutionary age, as well as age of amino acids. It is the first PDB-wide systematic evolutionary analysis of coenzyme-amino acid binding. Besides confirming some earlier theoretical assertions (such as role of backbone interactions in early peptide-coenzyme evolution) and observations (such as occurrence of the ancient phosphate-containing coenzymes in the oldest protein folds), it uncovers substantial novel knowledge. For example, (i) enrichment of early amino acids in the binding of ancient coenzymes, vs. enrichment of late amino acids in the binding of LUCA and Post-LUCA coenzymes, (ii) the trends in secondary structure content of the binding sites of coenzyme of different temporalities, (iii) increased involvement of metal ions in the ancient coenzyme binding events, and (iv) the capacity of only early amino acids to bind ancient coenzymes. In our humble opinion, all of these points bring important contributions in the peptide-coenzyme knowledge gap which has been discussed in a number of previous studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p>(1) By only focusing on coenzymes, the authors may have overestimated their importance. What about other small molecules that existed in the prebiotic soup? Do they also prefer such ancient amino acids? If so, this might reflect the interaction propensity of specific amino acids rather than some possible role in very ancient proteins. Or it might diminish the conjectured importance of coenzymes.</p></disp-quote><p>The following sentence was added in the discussion of the revised manuscript:</p><p>“This would also be true for direct interaction of early peptides/proteins and metal ions, independent of organic cofactor involvement, as discussed previously by us and others (Bromberg et al., 2022; Frenkel-Pinter et al., 2020; Fried et al., 2022). For example, it has been observed that coordination of prebiotically most relevant metal ions (e.g., Mg2+) is more often mediated by early amino acids such as Asp and Glu, whereas metal ions of later relevance (e.g., Cu and Zn) bind more frequently via late amino acids like His and Cys (Fried et al. 2022). Similarly, ancient metal binding folds have been shown to be enriched in early amino acids (Bromberg et al., 2022).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors should analyze whether the interactions are with similar types of amino acids in ancient versus early proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>While we appreciate the interesting suggestion, we would like to clarify that we did not aim to elucidate the differences between early and late protein folds - we agree that this might add an interesting perspective to our work, but we feel that it is well beyond the scope of our current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors might also wish to do sequence alignments to the structures in early versus late evolving proteins to see how general this pattern of residue usage is beyond the limited set of proteins found in the PDB.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting suggestion but similar to the previous recommendation, it is not within the scope of this study where no distinction between early and late evolving proteins has been made.</p><p>There has been a number of attempts to classify the folds as shared among Bacteria, Archea and Eukaryota or specific to one or two of these groups of organisms (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00239-023-10136-x">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00239-023-10136-x</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9541633/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9541633/</ext-link>) - this does not however compare easily with our time scales - where ancient ligands occur well before the last common ancestor.</p><p>We also agree the set of sequences present in the PDB is biased, but perhaps it is less biased than we have thought.
