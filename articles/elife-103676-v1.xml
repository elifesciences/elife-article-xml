at specific locations called their place fields (PFs). New PFs are constantly born even in familiar surroundings (during representational drift), and many rapidly emerge when the animal explores a new or altered environment (during global or partial remapping). Behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity (BTSP), a plasticity mechanism based on prolonged somatic action potential (AP) bursts induced by dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup>/NMDA plateau potentials, was recently proposed as the main cellular mechanism underlying new PF formations (PFFs), but it is unclear whether burst-associated large somatic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transients are always necessary and/or sufficient for PFF. To address this issue, here we performed in vivo two-photon [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] imaging of hippocampal CA1 PCs in head-restrained mice to investigate somatic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] dynamics underlying PFFs in familiar and novel virtual environments. Our results demonstrate that although many PFs are formed by BTSP-like events, PFs also emerge with initial [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] dynamics that do not match any of the characteristics of BTSP. BTSP- and non-BTSP-like new PFFs occur spontaneously in familiar environments, during neuronal representational switches, and instantaneously in new environments. Our data also reveal that solitary [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transients with larger amplitudes than those evoking BTSP-like PFFs frequently occur without inducing PFs, demonstrating that large [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transients per se are not sufficient for PFF.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>place cell</kwd><kwd>two-photon imaging</kwd><kwd>BTSP</kwd><kwd>synaptic plasticity</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0472cxd90</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.3030/787157</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nusser</surname><given-names>Zoltan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0472cxd90</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.3030/771849</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Makara</surname><given-names>Judit K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/017aqg979</institution-id><institution>Hungarian Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ADVANCED 150798</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nusser</surname><given-names>Zoltan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/006w34k90</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>55008740</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Makara</surname><given-names>Judit K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02ks8qq67</institution-id><institution>Hungarian Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NAP2022-I-1/2022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Makara</surname><given-names>Judit K</given-names></name><name><surname>Nusser</surname><given-names>Zoltan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging reveals that place fields of hippocampal place cells emerge with variable cellular mechanisms.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The hippocampus plays a critical role in spatial and contextual memory processes by forming cognitive maps of environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O’Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moser et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lisman et al., 2017</xref>) that can support effective navigation toward learned salient locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Robinson et al., 2020</xref>). During navigation, many pyramidal cells (PCs) in the dorsal hippocampal CA1 area (CA1PCs) exhibit action potential (AP) firing that is restricted to spatial locations, the cell’s place fields (PFs). In different environments, the activity of CA1PCs reorganizes to collectively form distinct representations, that is creating specific maps of each environment. In a novel environment, many CA1PCs are active already during the first traversal of their PFs, but a fraction of cells become place cells after some delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hill, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wilson and McNaughton, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frank et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Epsztein et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cohen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sheffield et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dong et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, spatial maps also gradually reorganize during continuous or repeated exploration of already familiar environments due to changes in the activity of individual PCs, including the recruitment of new place cells into the representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mankin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ziv et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rubin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Keinath et al., 2022</xref>). Despite the fundamental importance of the dynamic hippocampal population code in spatial navigation, the mechanisms initiating and mediating new PF formations (PFFs) are still poorly understood.</p><p>How can place cells acquire their PFs? While cells that are already active at the first traversal of their PFs may simply receive sufficient active spatially tuned synaptic inputs <italic>ab ovo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Epsztein et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cohen et al., 2017</xref>), delayed PFF is assumed to require dynamic changes in synaptic inputs or the intrinsic excitability of CA1PCs. The cellular mechanisms underlying de novo formation of PFs have been elusive due to difficulties in measuring the subthreshold activity pattern that drives AP firing. However, recent studies have shed light on possible mechanisms. Most strikingly, in vivo patch-clamp recordings in head-fixed mice running on a familiar cue-rich treadmill revealed the spontaneous appearance of new PFs in previously silent cells, following the sudden occurrence of a robust, prolonged depolarization driving complex spike burst (CSB) firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bittner et al., 2015</xref>). Such CSBs are thought to be driven by dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes (plateau potentials) mediated by voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and NMDA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Takahashi and Magee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grienberger et al., 2014</xref>). The formation of new PFs by plateau potentials is thought to be mediated by synaptic plasticity obeying a non-Hebbian rule, whereby the excitatory input synapses activated in a ~2-s-long time window around the CSB are rapidly potentiated. This form of plasticity was named behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity (BTSP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bittner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Milstein et al., 2021</xref>). After initial electrophysiological demonstration, spontaneous PFF with BTSP-like characteristics was observed in CA1PCs by in vivo [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] imaging as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grienberger and Magee, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Priestley et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">O’Hare et al., 2025</xref>). PFF with features similar to spontaneous BTSP-like PFF could also be induced artificially by strong sustained electrical or optogenetic depolarization of a cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bittner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bittner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Diamantaki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Milstein et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gonzalez et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rolotti et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fan et al., 2023</xref>), a stimulus assumed to evoke plateau potentials. In summary, BTSP evoked by CSBs has been proposed to serve as the main mechanism driving de novo PFF; however, its triggering mechanisms are enigmatic and its prevalence under different behavioral conditions is not yet known.</p><p>Whereas BTSP is a suitable and attractive candidate, other mechanisms may also contribute to PFF. In vivo patch-clamp recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cohen et al., 2017</xref>) from CA1PCs in head-fixed mice running in a novel virtual environment showed that most of the delayed PFFs did not begin with CSBs, but with a weak subthreshold spatially tuned depolarization that increased when the PF emerged. This result suggests the involvement of synaptic plasticity mechanisms other than BTSP, such as subthreshold cooperative plasticity mechanisms operating locally in dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Golding et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mehta, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dudman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sjöström et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sheffield and Dombeck, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Magó et al., 2020</xref>) with the potential contribution of conventional Hebbian plasticity after initial spiking begins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Magee and Johnston, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Markram et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bi and Poo, 1998</xref>). Furthermore, network mechanisms may also drive the emergence of new PFs. It has been shown that optogenetic stimulation of a small subset of CA1PCs at a particular location induced PFF or remapping in non-stimulated cells, suggesting that changes in synaptic coupling and circuit dynamics of PCs and inhibitory interneurons can also lead to reorganization of spatial maps by unmasking latent PFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McKenzie et al., 2021</xref>). Also pointing to a network effect, optogenetic induction of BTSP-like PFF has been shown to be restricted by lateral inhibition, strongly limiting the number of CA1PCs that can simultaneously form new PFs by BTSP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rolotti et al., 2022</xref>). Altogether, a comprehensive understanding of the contribution of possibly diverse cellular mechanisms underlying PFF during various forms of remapping processes is lacking.</p><p>BTSP has several unique features when probed by somatic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grienberger and Magee, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Priestley et al., 2022</xref>). First, the prolonged CSB results in large [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transients during the initial PFF event, typically followed by weaker Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals on consecutive traversals through the PF. Second, due to the long and asymmetric temporal kernel of the plasticity (favoring potentiation of inputs active 1–2 s before the CSB), a substantial backward shift in the spatial position of the PF center can be observed on linear tracks after the formation lap. Third, the width of the new PF is generally proportional to the running speed of the animal during the PFF event. In contrast, PFF by other synaptic or network mechanisms is not expected to exhibit such properties. Using these features, we aimed to characterize PFFs as mediated by BTSP- or non-BTSP-like mechanisms in large populations of CA1PCs. We performed two-photon [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] imaging of CA1PCs in head-fixed mice performing a spatial navigation task in familiar and partially novel virtual corridors. We find that BTSP is prevalent but is not the only mechanism driving PFFs, as many new PFs formed without exhibiting any of the characteristics of BTSP. Furthermore, we show that robust CSB-like somatic activity is often ineffective in inducing new PFs, suggesting that additional factors are required than just CSBs to successfully initiate new PFs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Place modulated activity of CA1PCs in mice navigating in a virtual corridor</title><p>In vivo two-photon [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] imaging of CA1PCs was performed from the dorsal hippocampus of head-restrained double transgenic mice (Thy1-GCaMP6s and Cre-dependent td-Tomato), injected with diluted Cre-recombinase expressing AAV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Mice were trained to run in an ~8-m-long virtual corridor for a water reward. The wall of the virtual corridor contained six well-discernible visual landmarks, the last of which indicated the reward zone (RZ), where mice were required to lick for water reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Well-trained mice ran with a relatively constant speed of ~30–40 cm/s through the corridor and slowed down and started licking just before entering the RZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), indicating that they learned the position of the RZ. Imaging was performed in well-trained mice across multiple days (<italic>n</italic> = 163 imaging sessions in 45 mice). The imaging field of view contained ~1000 CA1PC somata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which showed highly variable activities during the session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–H</xref>); some cells were silent whereas others showed moderate to high activity rates.

To investigate the possible mechanisms underlying such a robust change of activity, we examined the dynamics of the newly formed PFs. If BTSP is the mechanism generating new PFs in CA1PCs, the PFs are expected to have the following characteristics: first, since BTSP is induced by a plateau potential and consequential prolonged CSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bittner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bittner et al., 2017</xref>), we expect that the amplitude of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transient in the formation lap is larger than that in the following laps. Second, because of the asymmetrical temporal kernel of BTSP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bittner et al., 2017</xref>), the center of mass (COM) of the new PF is expected to shift to the backward direction compared to the peak activity in the formation lap. To quantify these dynamics, we calculated two parameters for each newly formed PF: the formation lap gain and the initial COM shift (see Methods and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Priestley et al., 2022</xref>). We then categorized all newly formed PFs in our recordings based on these two parameters. Using a conservative approach, we categorized a new PF to be formed by a BTSP-like mechanism if it had both positive gain and negative shift values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <italic>n</italic> = 311 new PFs), whereas new PFs exhibiting neither positive gain nor negative shift were considered as non-BTSP-like events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <italic>n</italic> = 58).

Furthermore, both types of new PFs exhibited similar distributions along the virtual track, tiling the whole corridor with increased densities around the visual landmarks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The prevalence of PFF did not appear to be related to the time from first training session or the number of previous sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>A further characteristic feature of BTSP is that, due to its seconds-wide temporal kernel, the width of the new PF is proportional to the running speed of the animal during the formation lap, that is the potentiated inputs cover a wider spatial sector if the animal travels longer distance during the plasticity time window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bittner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Priestley et al., 2022</xref>). As an independent confirmation that newly formed PFs in our categorization of PF groups genuinely differed in the mechanisms underlying their formation, we found a significant positive correlation between formation lap running speed and PF width in the BTSP-like but not in the non-BTSP-like PF category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Because of the difference in the number of events in the two groups, we randomly subsampled the BTSP-like events to the sample size of the non-BTSP-like PFF events 10,000 times and performed regression analysis. This bootstrapping revealed that both the <italic>r</italic> and p values of the fit to the non-BTSP data fell outside the 95% confidence interval of the bootstrapped BTSP values, indicating that the difference between the two groups was robust.</p><p>Because the running speed did not appear to fully account for the observed variance in PF width, we examined the contribution of our VR wall structure to PF width. Our standard VR wall pattern contained several narrow, salient visual landmarks, separated by longer corridor segments with a gray low-contrast pattern. We found that the animal’s distance to the closest visual landmark center significantly correlated with PF width for both BTSP- and non-BTSP-like PFFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Considering the effects of both speed and cue distance, we found that cue distance explained a similarly large fraction of the PF width variance for both BTSP- and non-BTSP-like PFFs, whereas speed explained a moderate proportion of PF width variance only in the case of BTSP-like PFFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These results demonstrate that in our VR environment, the complexity of the wall pattern is a major contributor to the PF width in both BTSP- and non-BTSP-like PFF events.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Concentrated PFF associated with representational switch</title><p>We next examined the distribution of new PFF events across imaging sessions and laps. While in most of the sessions, the number of newly formed PFs was moderate, a few sessions contained unusually large numbers of such events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). When we examined the distribution of new PFFs in these sessions across individual laps, we found that the majority of PFF events occurred within a short period over a limited number (3–10) of consecutive laps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). These concentrated PFF periods were termed PFF ‘surges’, which included PFs formed both by BTSP- and non-BTSP-like mechanisms (non-BTSP: 22 events; BTSP: 40 events, non-BTSP/BTSP ratio: 0.55). The unusually high rate of new PFF events during PFF surges led us to investigate whether they were associated with a more general network-wide reorganization of the CA1PC representation of the virtual corridor. Indeed, we found that the lap-by-lap correlation of activity in the whole population of imaged CA1PCs underwent a drastic and rapid switch between two stable states before and after the PFF surge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). A closer look indicated that the initial representation began to disorganize as the surge started to ramp up and a new coherent representation started at the lap with the peak PFF rate. No such representational switches were observed in sessions without PFF surges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, bottom). The remapping was essentially global, as only a small fraction (5.4%) of CA1PCs retained their pre-switch tuning curve after the switch. When we compared the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] dynamics of PFFs during surges with those of PFFs outside the surges, we found similar [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] amplitudes in both the BTSP- and non-BTSP-like groups, except for larger [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] signals in the first lap after the formation lap in the non-BTSP group during surges compared to outside surges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G, H</xref>). The period including the PFF surge and representational switch was not accompanied by any noticeable change in the behavioral performance of the animals as assessed by running speed and lick rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). Furthermore, multiday imaging revealed that in some animals, switching between the same two representations occurred on consecutive days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>), and occasionally, multiple representation switches within one imaging session could be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Altogether, these results reveal unique, short epochs during task-engaged behavior when rapid reorganization of the population activity of CA1PCs takes place, in part due to new PFFs by both BTSP- and non-BTSP-like mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>New PFF in a novel environment is mediated by both BTSP- and non-BTSP-like mechanisms</title><p>CA1PCs are known to rapidly remap in novel environments to create a specific representation of newly explored locations. We next sought to determine the contribution of BTSP- and non-BTSP-like mechanisms to new PFFs in a novel environment by extending the familiar virtual corridor with a 6-m-long segment decorated with never-seen visual landmarks during the imaging session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Animals traversed this novel segment with an average speed comparable to that in the familiar portion of the maze. The maze extension did not induce a detectable change in lick frequency. At the end of the familiar segment of the 14-m-long corridor, the animals reduced their running speed and displayed anticipatory licking just before entering the RZ, similarly to their performance in the standard 8-m-long corridor. Population-level analysis revealed a reorganization of the neuronal representation, as demonstrated by a decreased population vector (PV) correlation between the extended and original maze, despite high intra-segment correlations (mean correlation coefficients: original maze odd vs. even: 0.50 ± 0.19, original maze odd vs. extended maze even: 0.08 ± 0.10, extended maze odd vs. even: 0.36 ± 0.20; <italic>n</italic> = 6 mice; repeated measures ANOVA (p &lt; 0.001) followed by Tukey post hoc test: original maze odd − even vs. original maze odd − extended maze even: p &lt; 0.001, extended maze odd − even vs. original maze odd − extended maze even: p = 0.002, original maze odd − even vs. extended maze odd − even: p = 0.114).

We selected CA1PCs exhibiting at least one BTSP-like newly formed PF in a given imaging session in the familiar corridor and identified all somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in that session that had amplitudes larger than the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transient initiating the BTSP-like PFF (if multiple PFs were formed then the largest formation lap [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transient was used; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

During navigation in familiar and novel corridors, PFF events occurred in CA1PCs spontaneously along the entire corridor. Many of these events had characteristics reminiscent of those reported earlier for BTSP-like PFF events, but a significant fraction of PPFs had small [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transient amplitudes in the formation lap and did not show the characteristic backward shift in the COM of the newly formed PF. Such non-BTSP-like PFFs not only occurred spontaneously in familiar environments, but also during representational switches within familiar and in the first laps of the exploration of a novel environment. We also observed that in many sessions when a CA1PC displayed a BTSP-like PFF event, there were other large [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transients that did not induce novel PFs (solitary events) even though they had higher peak amplitudes than that of the BTSP-like PFF inducing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transient. These results demonstrate that BTSP-like PFF is an important but not exclusive mechanism of new PFFs and that large somatic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transients are not always sufficient per se to induce new PFs. We note, however, that our approach using somatic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] imaging does not provide information on dendritic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] signals; therefore, we cannot be sure that the large-amplitude somatic events indicate dendritic plateau potentials. In addition, the indirect relationship between electrical activity and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and the likely limited detectability of single APs under our experimental conditions also adds some uncertainty to our interpretations.</p><p>The lack of large initial somatic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transients – that are likely associated with strong bursts involving Ca<sup>2+</sup> plateaus – during non-BTSP-like PFFs suggests two possible scenarios: they either do not involve excitatory synaptic plasticity in CA1PCs but rather result from a change in incoming excitatory or inhibitory synaptic inputs, or they are driven by other synaptic plasticity mechanisms that do not require global Ca<sup>2+</sup> plateaus and CSBs to increase excitatory synaptic weights. Local synaptic plasticity in individual dendritic branches is a particularly intriguing possibility for the latter scenario, since it has been shown that PFF can be preceded by local dendritic activity at the future PF locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sheffield et al., 2017</xref>). This activity, presumably produced by clustered activation of Schaffer collateral synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adoff et al., 2021</xref>), may induce local synaptic potentiation, whereby the inputs eventually become suprathreshold at the soma manifesting as non-BTSP-like PFF. Importantly, long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synaptic inputs by local dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> and/or NMDA spikes (d-spikes) can be induced by a single or a few repetitions of d-spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Remy and Spruston, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Magó et al., 2020</xref>), and thus can be consistent with rapid generation of new PFs. It remains to be explored whether the temporal coincidence kernel of local d-spike-induced LTP is on milliseconds or seconds time scale, that is different from or similar to that of BTSP. In contrast to synaptic plasticity induced by d-spikes, LTP induced by cooperative activity of clustered excitatory inputs without evoking APs or d-spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Magó et al., 2020</xref>) or LTP induced by conventional forms of Hebbian plasticity, for example spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Magee and Johnston, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Markram et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bi and Poo, 1998</xref>) requires larger number of repeated co-activations of pre- and postsynaptic cells and thus may be incompatible with the fast dynamics of PFF. Nevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that non-BTSP-like PFFs may involve STDP once the cell starts to fire APs, as it has been proposed to contribute to changes in rate, shape, and position of PFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mehta et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mehta, 2015</xref>, but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Madar et al., 2025</xref>). Since STDP in CA1PCs has been characterized under in vitro conditions, it is yet unknown whether its induction rules are similar in vivo, especially in the presence of active neuromodulatory systems (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fisher et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, BTSP may also reinforce already existing weak PFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sheffield and Dombeck, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vaidya et al., 2025</xref>).</p><p>By showing that both BTSP- and non-BTSP-like PFFs can underlie changes in spatial tuning of CA1PCs and by dissecting their relative contribution under different remapping conditions, our study can reconcile diverse and sometimes contradictory earlier observations. Although BTSP-like PFF events have been suggested recently as a dominant mechanism of new PFFs in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bittner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bittner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Milstein et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grienberger and Magee, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rolotti et al., 2022</xref>), previous results also indicated that PFs in a new environment frequently form without CSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cohen et al., 2017</xref>). Recording from a large number of CA1PCs, we could estimate the prevalence of BTSP- and non-BTSP-like PFFs during various forms of remapping. We found that BTSP dominates PFFs under conditions when new PFs are born in individual CA1PCs that are part of a relatively stable representation in a familiar environment, i.e. during gradual representational drift. In contrast, the relative ratio of non-BTSP-like PFF was much higher in the first laps of a novel corridor segment. This may be consistent with a global remapping process in response to reconfiguration of the excitatory input patterns arriving to individual CA1PCs from upstream areas. As a result, in some CA1PCs, no plasticity would be required to immediately generate a new PF, while in other CA1PCs, plasticity of the newly activated inputs (e.g. by activating local d-spikes) may also contribute to non-BTSP-like PFF, with this process possibly facilitated by a change in brain state due to the novelty of the new corridor segment. These processes altogether could increase the contribution of non-BTSP-like PFF to the initial development of the novel representation of the newly explored corridor.</p><p>Our results are consistent with previous reports of increased PFF during initial exposure to novel environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Priestley et al., 2022</xref>) and around newly introduced salient cues in a familiar environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grienberger and Magee, 2022</xref>), although certain differences may be apparent. In particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Priestley et al., 2022</xref>, who classified BTSPs similarly to our method but pooled all PFF events not clearly BTSP as an ‘other’ group, observed increased fraction of BTSP-like PFF on the first trial in a novel environment compared to a familiar environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Priestley et al., 2022</xref>). Here, however, we have found an increase in the prevalence of non-BTSP-like PFF events during the initial exposure to the novel corridor. Yet, these results are not directly comparable for the following reasons: first, we defined the non-BTSP-like group as a subclass of ‘other’ PFFs based on multiple feature criteria to clearly separate them from BTSP-like PFFs; second, in the familiar environment, we only analyzed PFs that were formed after a silent period of at least 17 laps, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Priestley et al., 2022</xref> analyzed all PFs including those with established activity from the first lap in an environment.</p><p>Interestingly, we also observed spontaneous surges of coordinated new PFF events during short imaging epochs involving a few laps in the familiar corridor. These PFF surges included a high fraction of both non-BTSP- and BTSP-like PFF events and were associated with global remapping of the CA1 representation. The precise trigger and relevance of these representational ‘switches’ in a well-learned, invariant environment is currently unknown, but we speculate that – in the absence of alterations of sensory cues and task demands – they may indicate a change in the internal state of the animal, or a transition between relying on different signals for navigation (e.g. sensory cues vs. self-motion), assigning distinct internal contexts to the same environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sanders et al., 2020</xref>). Although different CA1 population codes across consecutive (interrupted) explorations of the same maze have been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sheintuch et al., 2020</xref>), to our knowledge, similar representational switches during a continuous behavioral epoch in an unchanged environment have only been described in the entorhinal cortex (EC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Low et al., 2021</xref>). It is possible that the representation switches we observed originate in the EC, which thus provides globally remapped inputs to the hippocampus similarly to the situation in a novel corridor. Overall, the higher ratio of non-BTSP- to BTSP-like PFFs in the initial laps of the novel environment and during representational switches (both ~0.60) than that in the familiar environment (0.19) suggests that distinct cellular/synaptic mechanisms might contribute to gradual representational drifts and abrupt global remapping.</p><p>While sudden large Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity at a location where a cell was previously inactive could often induce BTSP-like PFF, our results also demonstrate that a large fraction of even stronger Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities failed to initiate PFF in the same cell. If we assume that the large (and often prolonged) somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals represent CSBs, this indicates either that the synaptic plasticity induced by the underlying plateau was not sufficiently strong to lead to somatic firing (perhaps influenced by head-fixed VR navigation with diminished sensory cues, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ravassard et al., 2013</xref>), or that the induction of plasticity may be gated by additional factor(s), for example modulatory signals or inhibition. This latter possibility highlights the importance of elucidating the molecular components contributing to the initiation, expression, and regulatory mechanisms governing the long-term increase in synaptic strength by BTSP. While research efforts of the past three to four decades provided an enormous amount of information regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying Hebbian long-term synaptic plasticity, the molecular events taking place during BTSP are almost completely unknown. Further research will be crucial to reveal the similarities and differences in the molecular mechanisms underlying these fundamentally different synaptic plasticities, which will allow us to design molecular modifications that specifically alter only one of them to uncover its consequences on new PFFs and animal behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>A total of 45 (23 male and 22 female) Ai9xGP4.3 double-transgenic mice were used in this study.

The position of the maximum in this difference curve, corresponding to the steepest rising phase of the fluorescence transient, was used for trace alignment. For PF transitions without inferred events, the traces were aligned to their midpoint. Following trace alignment, an asymmetrical window encompassing –50–150 data points around the alignment point was isolated. The mean Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic> trace within this window across all transitions was calculated, and the position of its maximum determined.

Odd and even laps were separated and used for calculating mean inferred activity in each spatial bin across laps (odd and even tuning curves). ROIs with smaller than 0.25 Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient between odd and even tuning curves were excluded from further analysis. We assessed spatial information in each ROI using Skaggs’s metric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Skaggs et al., 1992</xref>). Statistical significance was assessed using a bootstrapping procedure performed in Python. The inferred activity data for each lap was circularly shifted with a random amount in time, and Skaggs’s information content was recalculated 1500 times to create a null distribution. ROIs with Skaggs’s score exceeding the 99th percentile of the shuffled distribution were selected for further processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eliav et al., 2021</xref>). Tuning curves for each ROI were calculated as the mean inferred activity in each spatial bin across laps. Peaks and their footprints, the area they cover on the space axis, in the tuning curves were identified using functions from the SciPy library: find_peaks (peak_height = 6), peak_prominences, and peak_widths (rel_height = 0.93). Adjacent peaks were merged if their footprints overlapped or the intervening minimum value between peaks was greater than half the amplitude of the larger peak. Spatial boundaries were calculated as the space bins at the left and right edges of spatial footprints. To identify spatial regions with statistically significant spatial tuning, we employed a localized information metric. First, for each peak identified in the tuning curves, we extended its footprint by half its width in both directions. Within these extended regions, a local Skaggs’ information metric was calculated. To assess the significance of this metric, a null distribution was generated using bootstrapping as above (1500 iterations). The inferred activity for the selected region was circularly permuted with a random time shift in each lap, followed by recalculating the Skaggs’ information content. The 95th percentile of this null distribution served as the significance criterion to identify regions exhibiting statistically high spatial location selectivity. Regions with statistically high spatial selectivity were considered as PFs if they had at least one inferred activity in at least 30% of the laps.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>Temporal demarcation</title><p>To ensure a conservative estimate of PFF time and avoid misidentification of small neuronal activities or noise as formation events, the inferred activity data below 64 a.u. was set to zero.

To account for the potential for PFs to exhibit a backward shift in activity relative to the formation lap, we extended the previously identified spatial boundaries in the forward direction (to the right) by 5 space bins or until the end of the corridor. This approach ensured that formation events occurring at locations forward compared to the PF’s spatial center (as expected for BTSP) would be detected. We identified potential PFF events by analyzing the inferred activity data across laps. First, we constructed a PF activity matrix by calculating the average activity for each space bin within the PF across all laps. To ensure minimal pre-formation event activity, only laps after the 17th were considered for potential formation events. A lap was classified as a formation lap only if no more than 10% of the previous laps had a mean activity exceeding 1% of the mean activity of the potential formation lap. In maze extension experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), the minimum 17 pre-formation laps requirement was ignored.

First, we excluded PFs that were formed in the first 17 laps. Second, we excluded PFs that exhibited a lifetime &lt;9 laps. Finally, we addressed activity consistency within PFs. Lap-wise maximum activity rates of the PF activity matrix were normalized to the peak activity rate across all laps. PFs were excluded if the number of silent laps (laps with normalized activity below 10%) exceeded eight laps. PFs were categorized as showing formation lap gain if the peak activity value within the spatial bounds of the PF was greater in the formation lap than the average peak activity value observed across the subsequent three active laps. For further categorization of the newly formed PFs, the location of the COM was calculated for each active lap and smoothed across laps using a running average with a kernel size of 3. The formation location of the PF was defined as the activity COM in the formation lap. Finally, the mean COM location for the first three post-formation active laps was calculated. If this mean value was smaller than the formation location value, the PF was categorized as exhibiting an initial backward shift. To exclude misinterpretation of occasionally observed continuous drift of the PF COM as BTSP-like initial shift, we also quantified continuous backward drift (termed ‘drift’) in the PF. For this, we first isolated the smoothed COM location values for each lap, starting from the fourth active lap after the formation. We then performed a linear regression analysis on these COM location value series. If the calculated COM location value in the first lap after the formation lap extrapolated from the regression line was not larger than the formation location or the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient between the COM location values and their sequential labels was not statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) with a negative value, we categorized the PF as lacking significant drift.</p><p>We categorized PFF events based on their activity patterns during and after formation. PFFs were considered BTSP-like if they fulfilled all of the following criteria: (1) showed formation lap gain, (2) followed by a backward shift, and (3) showed no significant further drift. Conversely, PFFs that lacked both (1) formation lap gain and (2) an initial backward shift during formation, regardless of the PFs’ drift characteristics, were classified as non-BTSP-like. These candidate BTSP- and non-BTSP-like PFFs were further analyzed as detailed below (see Quality control of signal isolation for BTSP- and non-BTSP-related PFFs). In our initial categorization of PFFs detected in the standard maze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), we found 806 candidate BTSP-like (52%) and 164 non-BTSP-like (10%) PFFs; an additional 593 PFs (38%) could not be included in the above two groups [40 PFs (3%) with formation lap gain and backward shift but significant backward drift; 238 PFs (15%) with formation lap gain but without backward shift; 315 PFs (20%) with no formation lap gain but with backward shift]; these PFs were excluded from further analysis.</p><p>We emphasize that we employed a conservative approach for categorizing PFFs: we only included PFF events in our analysis if they fulfilled all criteria of either BTSP- or non-BTSP-like groups and excluded PFFs that failed on at least one criterion. Yet, it should be noted that BTSP might occur without positive gain (if the cell fires CSBs in the PF on multiple laps after the formation lap) and possibly without negative shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Madar et al., 2025</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quality control of signal isolation for BTSP- and non-BTSP-related PFFs</title><p>Automated ROI segmentation by Suite2p can encompass processes from multiple cells which can lead to erroneously reported [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] dynamics during PF activity. To address this and facilitate human confirmation of automated ROI segmentation, we isolated short motion-corrected video segments from place cells and their surroundings exhibiting BTSP- and non-BTSP-like PFFs. To quantify the spatial footprints of active neurons during the animal’s PF transitions, we employed a method to assess local coherence of fluorescence signals within the field of view. For each pixel in an isolated video frame, we assigned an intensity by averaging the Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficients between its time series and the time series of its eight nearest neighbors. In the resultant grayscale image, pixels corresponding to active cells were given higher intensity values, reflecting the synchronized activation of these pixels during neuronal spiking. The contrast of the resulting grayscale image was further enhanced with Scikit-image’s exposure.adjust_sigmoid function (cutoff = 0.8, gain = 20). Finally, to incorporate the temporal aspect of pixel activation patterns, we applied a pseudo-color map. This map assigned a color to each pixel based on the COM of its intensity time series. In essence, these spatial footprints showed the shape of active cells with their subregions colored based on their average timing of activity. The spatial footprints of each PF transition were visually inspected and ROIs with multicolored subregions were excluded. This analysis was performed for all candidate BTSP- and non-BTSP-like PFFs in all experiments (normal maze, extended maze, and enriched maze).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Estimating the probability that a non-BTSP-like PFF event is misclassified</title><p>To assess the likelihood that a non-BTSP PFF is the consequence of random occurrence of a small [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transient before a BTSP-like PFF event in the future PF, we sequentially masked laps starting from the formation lap of a non-BTSP event until a BTSP signature was detected or the PF ended. If no BTSP signature was found, the transformation probability was set to zero. Otherwise, we defined a test area between the non-BTSP event start lap and the first BTSP-like event formation lap. Within this test area, we calculated the following two metrics: mean activity and the fraction of active laps. To generate a null distribution, we randomly sampled equal-sized segments from areas outside PFs and calculated the same metrics. A non-BTSP PFF was considered unlikely to be a misclassified BTSP PFF due to random activity if fewer than 5% of the null samples had a larger or equal fraction of active laps and a larger or equal mean activity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Detection of solitary [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transients</title><p>Solitary [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transients were identified by the following process. First, for each BTSP-like PFF event, we calculated the maximum Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic> value by analyzing time points recorded during the animal’s traversal across the width of the PF in the formation lap, extended by five space bins to the right but not further than the end of the corridor. This maximum amplitude served as the parameter for peak detection (Scipy, ‘find_peaks’, prominence = 1, distance = 20) to identify peaks equal to or larger than this formation lap peak amplitude. Second, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transients within the spatial boundaries of any existing or newly formed PFs were excluded. To further ensure that the detected solitary peak was not part of a short-lived place-modulated activity, we calculated the maximum Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic> value from the previous and following 5 laps within 11 spatial bins centered around the peak-containing space bin. If the maximum Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic> in this area exceeded the median plus two SD of the ROIs’ Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic> values from the entire session, the solitary event was excluded. For each ROI, only the largest solitary peak was used for calculating the mean waveform, but we note that in many cells, multiple [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transients in a given session fulfilled the criteria for solitary events.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Lap-by-lap PV correlations</title><p>For each Suite2p ROI, the non-thresholded inferred mean activity data collected during each lap in each space bin transition was computed. Subsequently, Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between the activities of all the ROIs at each spatial bin for every possible lap pair. Finally, the lap-by-lap PV correlation for a given lap pair was determined by averaging these location-specific correlation coefficients across spatial bins.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Odd-even lap PV correlations</title><p>To evaluate population-wide activity changes upon the extension of the familiar corridor by a new maze segment, we computed PV correlations between odd and even laps for the first 6 meters of the familiar pre-extension maze (excluding the RZ) and the 6-m-long new extension part of the maze. For each ROI, we first calculated the mean non-thresholded inferred activity from each spatial bin for both odd and even laps from the session immediately preceding novel maze segment insertion and during the extended maze experiment. These PVs were then used to calculate the average pairwise Pearson correlations between intra-corridor and cross-corridor odd–even lap data for each animal. Finally, we compared the means of these correlations across animals for both intra-corridor and cross-corridor PV correlations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Dependence of PF width on the running speed and cue distance</title><p>For the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>, PFs were excluded if their boundaries intersected with the start or end of the corridor, ensuring that PF widths were not truncated. In addition, PFF events where the running speed was lower than 5 cm/s were excluded.</p><p>We determined centroid coordinates of the discrete visual landmarks and calculated the Euclidean distance to the nearest landmark centroid for each point within the virtual maze.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Variance explained by speed and cue distance</title><p>We employed leave-one-out cross-validation and standard linear regression (statsmodels GLM, Gaussian family, identity link function) to model PF widths. Predictor variables were mean running speed during PF traversal on the formation lap and distance to the nearest landmark centroid or both. For each cross-validation iteration, the fitted model was used to predict the width of the left-out PF and prediction performance was evaluated using mean squared error (MSE). To quantify the proportion of variance explained, MSE values were normalized to the variance of the PF widths and the explained variance fraction was calculated as 1 − normalized MSE.</p><p>The animal’s subjective location within the VR and its distance from any virtual cues may be ambiguous. To address this, we iteratively tested starting positions within the first 50 cm of the VR corridor, and we selected the starting location in each animal that maximized the explained variance of PF width by the combined speed and cue distance model. This optimized starting position was used for the reported explained variance values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Comparison of inferred spikes and fluorescence</title><p>To compare PFs identified using inferred spike- and normalized fluorescence (Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic>)-based raster plots, we focused on ROIs exhibiting at least one newly formed PF in the regular maze sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). For each cell, we used data from the previously determined spatial footprints of both newly formed and existing PFs. Within each ROI, we concatenated the data from all identified PFs along the laps dimension of the raster plots. We then extracted the maximum Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic> value and the maximum of bin-wise mean inferred spike counts for each lap within this concatenated sequence. Subsequently, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between the pairs of maximum Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic> values and maximum mean inferred spike counts for each ROI. To generate a null distribution for comparison, we performed all possible lap-wise circular permutations of the inferred spike count values within the concatenated sequence. This effectively decoupled the relationship between spike counts and the fluorescence. For each permutation, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficients.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using Statistica (general linear model with repeated measures or mixed ANOVA; software version 14.0.1.25, Tibco) or Python (correlations, bootstrapping, explained variances).

Additionally, the authors took a conservative approach in classifying PFF events, ensuring that their findings were not confounded by noise or ambiguous activity.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>Despite the impressive dataset, there are several methodological and interpretational concerns that limit the impact of the findings. Firstly, the virtual environment appears to be poorly enriched, relying mainly on wall patterns for visual cues, which raises questions about the generalizability of the results to more enriched environments. Prior studies have shown that environmental enrichment can significantly influence spatial coding, and it would be important to determine how a more immersive VR environment might alter the observed PFF dynamics. Secondly, the study relies on deconvolution methods in some cases to infer spiking activity from calcium signals without in vivo ground truth validation. This introduces potential inaccuracies, as deconvolution is an estimate rather than a direct measure of spiking, and any conclusions drawn from these inferred signals should be interpreted with caution. Thirdly, the figures would benefit from clearer statistical annotations and visual enhancements. For example, several plots lack indicators of statistical significance, making it difficult for readers to assess the robustness of the findings. Furthermore, the use of bar plots without displaying underlying data distributions obscures variability, which could be better visualized with violin plots or individual data points. The manuscript would also benefit from a more explicit breakdown of the proportion of place fields categorized as BTSP-like versus non-BTSP-like, along with clearer references to figures throughout the results section. Lastly, the authors' interpretation of their data, particularly regarding the sufficiency of large calcium transients for PFF induction, needs to be more cautious. Without direct confirmation that these transients correspond to actual BTSP events (including associated complex spikes and calcium plateau potentials), concluding that BTSP is not necessary or sufficient for PFF formation is speculative.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors of this manuscript aim to investigate the formation of place fields (PFs) in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells.

We agree nonetheless that PFF is dominated by BTSP under these conditions, whereas the contribution of non-BTSP is larger during global remapping events.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, BTSP has a flip side that involves the weakening of existing place fields when a novel field emerges. Was this observed in the present study? Presumably place fields can disappear due to this bidirectional BTSP or due to global remapping. For a full comparison of the two phenomena, the disappearance of place fields must also be assessed.</p></disp-quote><p>In this study we focused on the birth of new PFs – yet, PFs not only form but also disappear constantly. The factors driving PF weakening are even less explored and understood than those driving PF birth. In fact, we observed (as illustrated by several examples in our MS) that many PFs weaken, or disappear completely during the course of an imaging session. These effects are sometimes accompanied by a new PFF event elsewhere (e.g. Figure 2 – figure supplement 2E bottom), whereas in other cases they are not (e.g. Figure 5A, middle). Similarly, some BTSP events seem to coincide with disappearance of another PF, but others are not (e.g. Figure 2A bottom, first PF along the track; Figure 3 – figure supplement 1A left, first PF). The picture is further complicated in the case of global remapping events (i.e. representation switches, Figure 3 – figure supplement 2B) that, by definition, include both new PFF and PF disappearance. We feel that exploration of the complex mechanisms at play in PF disappearance is outside the scope of the current study, but could be the subject of an interesting future investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, it would be good to know if place fields differ according to how they are born. For example, are there differences in reliability, width, peak rate, out-of-field firing, etc for those that arise due to BTSP vs non-BTSP.</p></disp-quote><p>We have analyzed several properties of the PFs and found no significant difference in either their width (BTSP: 46.4 ± 24.4 cm; non-BTSP: 50.4 ± 32.5 cm, p = 0.28) or peak rates (BTSP: 19.0 ± 14.7 a.u./s; non-BTSP: 21.4 ± 16.8 a.u./s, p = 0.27) or the out-of-field firing rates (BTSP: 0.64 ± 0.68 a.u./s; non-BTSP: 0.83 ± 1.25 a.u./s, p = 0.09, all unpaired t-test). We have included these data into the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Consider adding additional visual cues or environmental elements to the virtual reality (VR) setup to create a more enriched and immersive environment. Collect data from a couple of mice in the enriched environment and compare the PFF dynamics to the original environment. This would help determine whether the findings on PFF dynamics hold in a setting where spatial coding may be more robust. Including floor cues, distal visual markers, or varying textures might provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing BTSP-like and non-BTSP-like events.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for her/his suggestion of analyzing data obtained from a more enriched VR environment compared to the one we used in our study. We have now included data obtained in a profoundly different VR environment, which did not have sparse dominant visual landmarks, but the entire wall was covered with a rich pattern with different shapes of different colors. Our data from 11 imaging sessions from 4 mice revealed BTSP- and non-BTSP-like PFF events with approximately the same ratio to that found in our regular maze. These results are described in the Results section and are presented in a new supplementary figure (Figure 2 – figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Wherever deconvolved spikes were used for analysis, provide a comparison of results obtained directly from the GCaMP ΔF/F signals versus those derived from the deconvolved spiking data. This could illustrate any differences and help readers understand the limitations and reliability of the inference method.</p></disp-quote><p>We have adopted a currently widely accepted method in the field to infer spikes from fluorescent traces using the Suite2p software package. All of our analyses were then performed on the inferred spikes. To address the concerns of the Reviewer, we analyzed the relationship between the peak [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transients and inferred spike activity (new Figure 3 – figure supplement 1C-E). Our results clearly demonstrate a robust, highly significant correlation between these measures at the level of individual cells (new Figure 3 – figure supplement 1D) and the Spearman correlation coefficients show a distribution that is very different from random distributions (new Figure 3 – figure supplement 1E). From these, we conclude that using directly the fluorescent data would have resulted in largely similar PF detection and identification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Improve the visual clarity of figures by enlarging key elements such as arrows that indicate BTSP-like events. Consider using colors that stand out more clearly to guide readers' attention.

This will help readers quickly interpret the data without needing to refer back to the text.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the suggestion of the Reviewer, we have enlarged the arrows.

As described in the Methods, after identifying BTSP- and non-BTSP-like PFF events using the shift and gain criteria, we have manually checked each of these ROIs and the spatial footprint of every new PFF events for these cells and excluded ROIs with non-soma-like shapes and activities with spurious footprints suggesting contamination, creating a ‘cleaned’ dataset. We did not perform such visual inspection and manual curation of every ROI’s spatial footprints that belong to the two additional categories (no gain with shift, gain without shift, 872 events). Since these classes are also overestimated without curation, we cannot provide a precise fraction of the BTSP- and non-BTSP-like PFF events from the total recorded PFF population. However, - assuming that factors leading to exclusion affect all groups equally - we can provide their fractions by comparing the numbers of newly born PFs in all categories before the visual inspections. In the normal maze, we found 806 candidate BTSP-like (52%),164 non-BTSP-like (10%) PFFs and an additional 593 PFs (38%) could not be included in these two groups [40 PFs (3%) with formation lap gain and backward shift but significant backward drift; 238 PFs (15%) with formation lap gain but without backward shift; 315 PFs (20%) with no formation lap gain but with backward shift].

Now we discuss this and other limitations in the MS (Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Although the author has outlined three characteristics of place fields (PFs) generated by behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity (BTSP) during calcium imaging in the Introduction section, as follows: ' First, the prolonged CSB results in large [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] transient during the initial PFF event, typically followed by weaker Ca2+ signals on consecutive traversals through the PF. Second, due to the long and asymmetric temporal kernel of the plasticity (favoring potentiation of inputs active 1-2 seconds before the CSB) a substantial backward shift in the spatial position of the PF center can be observed on linear tracks after the formation lap. Third, the width of the new PF is generally proportional to the running speed of the animal during the PFF event.' Figure 3B, which displays the third feature of classified BTSP and non-BTSP data, serves as an important confirmation of the classification results using the first two features. Even though the Spearman correlation indicated a significant difference, the raw data distributions of BTSP and non-BTSP appear similar, suggesting that a distribution of bootstrap and more stringent confirmation should be conducted to be convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>As described in the MS, because of the difference in the number of events in the two groups, we randomly subsampled the BTSP-like events to the sample size of the non-BTSP-like PFF events 10000 times and performed regression analysis. This bootstrapping revealed that both the r and p values of the fit to the non-BTSP data fell outside the 95% confidence interval of the bootstrapped BTSP values, indicating that the difference between the groups was robust.</p><p>In further analysis during the revision, we found that the PF width variance explained by distance from landmarks is substantially larger than the variance explained by the running speed during the formation lap. We performed a cross-validated analysis by these two factors (Figure 3D), which highlights that speed explains some of the PF width variance of BTSP-like PFFs, but none of the non-BTSP PFFs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The proportions of the three types should be provided. page 6: ' Using a conservative approach, we categorized a new PF to be formed by a BTSP-like mechanism if it had both positive gain and negative shift values (Figure 2A; n = 310 new PFs), whereas new PFs exhibiting neither positive gain nor negative shift were considered as non-BTSP-like events (Figure 2B; n = 59). All other newly formed PFs (no-gain with backward shift and gain without backward shift) were excluded from further analysis.' The number of excluded newly formed PFs should be disclosed, as well as the distribution ratio of these three types in each animal.</p></disp-quote><p>The number of BTSP- and non-BTSP-like PFF events are given in the MS.
