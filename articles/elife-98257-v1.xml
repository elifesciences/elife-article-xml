during cardiovascular development. Smads, key effectors of TGFβ signaling, are sequestered by microtubules (MTs) and need to be released for pathway function. Independently, TGFβ signaling also stabilizes MTs. Molecular details and the in vivo relevance of this cross-regulation remain unclear, understanding which is important in complex biological processes such as cardiovascular development. Here, we use <italic>rudhira/Breast Carcinoma Amplified Sequence 3 (Bcas3</italic>), an MT-associated, endothelium-restricted, and developmentally essential proto-oncogene, as a pivot to decipher cellular mechanisms in bridging TGFβ signaling and MT stability. We show that Rudhira regulates TGFβ signaling in vivo, during mouse cardiovascular development, and in endothelial cells in culture. Rudhira associates with MTs and is essential for the activation and release of Smad2/3 from MTs. Consequently, Rudhira depletion attenuates Smad2/3-dependent TGFβ signaling, thereby impairing cell migration. Interestingly, Rudhira is also a transcriptional target of Smad2/3-dependent TGFβ signaling essential for TGFβ-induced MT stability. Our study identifies an immediate early physical role and a slower, transcription-dependent role for Rudhira in cytoskeleton-TGFβ signaling crosstalk. These two phases of control could facilitate temporally and spatially restricted targeting of the cytoskeleton and/or TGFβ signaling in vascular development and disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Rudhira</kwd><kwd>BCAS3</kwd><kwd>microtubule cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>Smad2/3</kwd><kwd>TGFβ signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sanction no.

The multifunctional transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) pathway regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and migration and is sensitive to cytoskeletal rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tzima, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guo and Wang, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Moustakas and Heldin, 2008</xref>). Depletion of TGFβ pathway components causes developmental abnormalities, often leading to embryonic death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lebrin et al., 2005</xref>). Ligand binding activates the TGFβ receptor, causing receptor-mediated phosphorylation, followed by nuclear translocation of Smad proteins, resulting in transcriptional regulation of target gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hata and Chen, 2016</xref>). Smads, the effectors of the TGFβ pathway, are competitively bound by several proteins and are a hub for regulation of TGFβ signaling and its intersecting pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Massagué, 2008</xref>). Microtubules (MTs) bind to and sequester Smad2/3 and Smad4, thereby negatively regulating TGFβ signaling, which is relieved upon TGFβ stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dong et al., 2000</xref>). Conversely, TGFβ signaling stabilizes MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gundersen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">You et al., 2020</xref>) through an as yet unclear mechanism, suggestive of a feedback loop.</p><p>During development, TGFβ signaling is activated in endothelial cells (ECs) of the remodeling angiogenic endothelium and is critical for vascular development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Goumans et al., 2009</xref>). MT stability is also essential for angiogenic sprouting in ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Joshi and Inamdar, 2019</xref>). MTs can be stabilized in multiple ways within the cell, initially by RhoA-mDia actin bundling and thereafter by interaction with multi-protein complexes. Serum components, TGFβ and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), have been shown to stabilize MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gundersen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cook et al., 1998</xref>). While LPA stabilizes MTs within 30 min post-stimulation and generically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cook et al., 1998</xref>), the effect of TGFβ signaling takes at least 2 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gundersen et al., 1994</xref>) but is more restricted to and essential for endothelial cell function in vivo. Slow and restricted induction of MT stability by TGFβ as compared to the more generic and rapid function of LPA suggests a requirement for new transcription/translation which may be developmentally important. However, the molecular mechanisms and biological relevance of cytoskeletal interactions with TGFβ signaling remain elusive. Characterization of tissue-restricted regulators of the ubiquitous MT cytoskeleton may aid in defining its specialized context-dependent functions.</p><p>In this study, we address the role of the MT-interacting protein Rudhira in connecting TGFβ signaling and MT stability. Rudhira associates with MTs and intermediate filaments (IFs), stabilizes MTs, and promotes directional cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Joshi and Inamdar, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jain et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>Rudhira</italic> knockout in mouse causes mid-gestation lethality due to aberrant cardiovascular patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shetty et al., 2018</xref>). Transcriptome analysis showed that several processes were deregulated in the <italic>rudhira</italic> knockout, especially a large number of TGFβ signaling pathway components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shetty et al., 2018</xref>). This suggests that Rudhira may regulate TGFβ signaling for vascular development.</p><p>Here, we show that Rudhira-depleted cells have reduced Smad2/3 activation during mouse embryonic development, indicating that Rudhira is a positive regulator of TGFβ signaling. We demonstrate that Rudhira facilitates TGFβ-mediated release of Smad2/3 from MTs. Further, TGFβ signaling stabilizes MTs by inducing transcription, in a Rudhira-dependent manner. Thus, Rudhira bridges TGFβ signaling and MT stability, required for cardiovascular development. Ectopic and aberrant Rudhira expression is seen in several carcinomas and positively correlates with tumor metastatic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Siva et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bärlund et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gururaj et al., 2006</xref>). Hence, our study will aid in understanding TGFβ signaling and suggest novel ways to regulate it in development and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rudhira depletion attenuates Smad2/3-dependent TGFβ signaling in vivo and in vitro</title><p><italic>Rudhira/Bcas3</italic> is an essential gene, critical for mouse cardiovascular development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shetty et al., 2018</xref>). Ubiquitous (<italic>Rudhira<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) or endothelial (<italic>Rudhira CKO</italic>) knockout of <italic>rudhira</italic> results in angiogenic defects and mid-gestation embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shetty et al., 2018</xref>). Transcripts of several components of the TGFβ pathway are deregulated upon Rudhira depletion and the knockout phenocopies mutants of several TGFβ pathway components, whose primary phenotype is in the cardiovascular system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Goumans et al., 2009</xref>). Hence, we characterized the role of Rudhira in TGFβ signaling. Analysis of the molecular interaction, reaction, and relation networks by KEGG pathway mapping indicated that multiple components of the TGFβ pathway were deregulated in the absence of Rudhira, affecting several processes important for cardiovascular development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To validate this, we used non-silencing (NS) control and <italic>rudhira</italic> knockdown (KD) saphenous vein endothelial cell (SVEC) lines as described before (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shetty et al., 2018</xref>). To test the pathway regulation at the level of receptors, we analyzed transcript and basal as well as active protein levels. While we observed some reduction in transcript levels of <italic>Tgfbr1</italic> and <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), the basal and active protein levels of TGFBR1 remained unchanged in KD cells (, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, a constitutively active form of TGFBR1 (TGFBR1T204D), expressed under the CMV promoter, was also suppressed in Rudhira KD (overexpression achieved in NS ~200 folds while in KD ~80 folds) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). TGFBR1 protein has a short half-life, while the mRNA is relatively stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Vizán et al., 2013</xref>). Reduced amounts of relatively stable RNA may be sufficient to produce adequate protein levels. These increased levels of active TGFBR1 in KD were unable to restore Smad2 phosphorylation, unlike NS controls, which showed a clear increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). While it is important to note that Rudhira or its loss may regulate <italic>Tgfbr</italic> transcript levels, these results support a receptor-independent role of Rudhira in regulating the TGFβ pathway.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Rudhira depletion deregulates developmental endothelial transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) KEGG pathway map indicating TGFβ pathway genes from KEGG database that are deregulated upon <italic>rudhira</italic> depletion in mouse embryonic yolk sac, based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shetty et al., 2018</xref>.

Specifically, the developmentally essential, tissue-restricted TGFβ signaling pathway regulates and is regulated by the MT cytoskeleton. However, the underlying molecular mechanism and in vivo relevance of this cross-regulation remain elusive. In this study, we probed the role of Rudhira in the cytoskeletal control of TGFβ signaling and, in turn, its effect on MT properties. Our study identifies a dual role of Rudhira during vascular development - an early role in MT-mediated regulation of Smad2/3 and a late role as a transcriptional target of TGFβ signaling required for MT stability.</p><p>While several processes important for cardiovascular development were deregulated in <italic>rudhira<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos, the TGFβ pathway was primarily affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shetty et al., 2018</xref>). TGFβ signaling is a complex pathway and is regulated at multiple levels by various feedback loops. One of the complicated yet delicate feedback circuits is the regulation of receptor levels and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Yan et al., 2018</xref>). Rudhira depletion reduces transcript level without altering basal and active protein level of TGFBR1. This disparity in the transcript and protein level may arise from the fact that while the <italic>Tgfbr</italic> transcript is very stable, the protein is quite unstable, and lower transcript levels may still be sufficient for generating adequate protein levels. Such a phenomenon is not unusual, particularly for membrane proteins, where mRNA levels may not correlate with protein levels. Rudhira, in a manner not yet understood, may also be a part of a broader feedback pathway as it further negatively regulates levels of TGFβ pathway inhibitors such as Smurfs and Smad7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shetty et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that additional regulatory mechanisms may operate.</p><p>TGFβ signaling and Rudhira promote cell migration in a synergistic and interdependent manner. Mechanistically, Rudhira promotes TGFβ-dependent release of Smads from MTs, likely due to increased Rudhira-MT association. This could allow pathway activation and result in enhanced cell migration. Additional, confounding factors downstream of the autoregulatory TGFβ pathway or pathway targets, as described above, may also contribute to Rudhira-dependent cell migration in response to TGFβ. Converse regulation of Rudhira-MT and Smad-MT interaction is indicative of probable competition between Smads and Rudhira for MT binding, which merits further investigation. Binding of Rudhira to MTs may also alter them in a way that makes MTs unavailable for Smad binding. Since TGFβ stimulation is known to stabilize MTs, we hypothesize that TGFβ stimulation increases Rudhira binding to stable MTs. While unclear molecular events involved in the release of Smads from MTs and MT stabilization by Rudhira make it difficult to assign causal roles, this study supports the hypothesis that dissociation of Smads from MTs is essential for Smad activation. In addition, though MTs are ubiquitously and abundantly present, our data suggest that only a few MTs participate in Smad sequestration. This is in concordance with our earlier study, which shows that Rudhira associates preferentially with stable MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Joshi and Inamdar, 2019</xref>).</p><p>The TGFβ signaling pathway is autoregulatory, and many of its components are also targets of the pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Miyazono, 2000</xref>). The <italic>rudhira</italic> promoter harbors SBEs. We show that <italic>rudhira</italic>, in addition to being a regulator of the TGFβ pathway, is also a transcriptional target. However, further analysis is required to identify the specific mechanisms by which Smad-dependent, TGFβ-induced, <italic>rudhira</italic> transcription is regulated during development. In contrast to this positive feedback, the TGFβ pathway is also negatively self-regulated, allowing for a return to basal state amenable for reactivation. This self-suppression could possibly involve increased turnover of receptors and Smad2/3, and increased expression of inhibitory Smads, that may recover responsiveness to TGFβ stimulation. Additionally, in the context of MT-dependent Smad2/3 inhibition, the still short turnover time of stable MTs (several minutes to hours) may also promote quick return to resting state. These interesting possibilities can now be tested.</p><p><italic>Rudhira</italic> expression is tightly regulated and restricted to the remodeling endothelium during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shetty et al., 2018</xref>). Mechanistically, Rudhira promotes MT stability for angiogenic remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Joshi and Inamdar, 2019</xref>). Independent studies show that TGFβ signaling and MT reorganization are essential for cardiovascular development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ferrari et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Martin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bayless and Johnson, 2011</xref>). Deletion of <italic>Smad2/3</italic> or <italic>tubulins</italic> leads to embryonic lethality with severely defective embryonic and extra-embryonic vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Itoh et al., 2012</xref>). However, the role of MT stability for angiogenic sprouting in vivo and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Our study suggests that endothelial cytoskeleton remodeling by Rudhira and activation of TGFβ signaling during cardiovascular development are interdependent and cross-regulated. TGFβ signaling may lead to restricted induction of MT stability by inducing the expression of MT-stabilizing developmentally regulated proteins like Rudhira. Additional cytoskeletal components such as Vimentin that interacts with Rudhira, and is also a target of TGFβ signaling, are likely to be involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Joshi and Inamdar, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jain et al., 2012</xref>). Our analysis will help gain better insight into cellular processes such as migration, which require maintenance of cytoskeletal stability and active signaling for extended periods. An added advantage will be the ability to decipher deregulated migration such as in tumor metastasis. While targeting MT-Smad interaction would allow regulation of the TGFβ pathway, the ubiquitous nature of these molecules is likely to result in widespread and possibly undesirable effects of therapeutic intervention. Rudhira expression, being more restricted, could provide a suitable target to regulate developmental and pathological TGFβ signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal experiments</title><p>Animal experiments were performed as mentioned earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shetty et al., 2018</xref>).

The authors demonstrate that Rudhira is a critical signaling modulator for TGFβ signaling by releasing Smad2/3 from cytoskeletal microtubules and how that Rudhira is a Smad2/3 target gene. Taken together, the authors provide a model of how Rudhira contributes to TGFβ signaling activity to stabilize the microtubules, which is essential for vascular development.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study used different methods and techniques to achieve aims and support conclusions, such as Gene Ontology analysis, functional analysis in culture, immunostaining analysis, and proximity ligation assay. This study provides unappreciated additional layer of TGFβ signaling activity regulation after ligand-receptor interaction.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) It is unclear how current findings provide a better understanding of Rudhira KO mice, which the authors published some years ago.</p><p>(2) Why do they use HEK cells instead of SVEC cells in Fig 2 and 4 experiments?</p><p>(3) A model shown in Fig 5E needs improvement to grasp their findings easily.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98257.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Joshi</surname><given-names>Divyesh</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bangalore</named-content></addr-line><country>India</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jindal</surname><given-names>Preeti</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bangalore</named-content></addr-line><country>India</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shetty</surname><given-names>Ronak K</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bangalore</named-content></addr-line><country>India</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Inamdar</surname><given-names>Maneesha S</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bangalore</named-content></addr-line><country>India</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>According to the reviewers' comments, we appreciate your substantial updates. However, the statistical issue remains unsolved. The following is a general way to get fold changes between controls and experimental samples. Each sample will generate relative differences between target molecules and internal controls. For the case of Fig 1B, the target is pSmad2, and the internal control is the total Smad2. Three control samples will generate three numbers for pSmad2/Smad2 ratios with variations. Similarly, T204D samples will generate three numbers with variations. Then, the average of these three numbers will be set as 1 (with variations) to calculate fold changes between the control and T204D groups. The point is that the statistical significance needs to be evaluated between two groups with variations. This standard method differs from what you described in the manuscript. I hope this explains why the issue needs to be fixed. Please work on the following 11 panels to revise.</p><p>(1) Fig 1B, WB, pSmad2, reference Smad2, loading control GAPDH, fold change by T204D.</p><p>(2) Fig 1C, WB, pSmad2, reference Smad2, loading control GAPDH, fold change by Tb/Rudhira.</p><p>(3) Fig 1D, QRT PCR, pai1/mmp9, fold change by Tb treatment, reference not disclosed.</p><p>(4) Fig 2A, migration, crystal red absorbance.</p><p>(5) Fig 2B, migration, crystal red absorbance.</p><p>(6) Fig 4A, QRT PCR, fold change by Tb.</p><p>(7) Fig 4B, WB, Rudhira, fold change by Tb.</p><p>(8) Fig 4C, intensity, with variation, fine.</p><p>(9) Fig 4D, WB, Rudhira, loading control GAPDH, fold change by Smad2/3 silencing.</p><p>(10) Fig 5A, WB, Rudhira/Glu-Tub, loading control GAPDH, fold change by Tb and/or AcD.</p><p>(11) Fig 5C, WB, Glu-Tub.</p></disp-quote><p>For western blots:</p><p>Graphs for western blots in the following figures have been modified to show the variance in controls, as suggested:</p><p>(1) Fig 1B, WB, pSmad2, reference Smad2, loading control GAPDH, fold change by T204D.</p><p>(2) Fig 1C, WB, pSmad2, reference Smad2, loading control GAPDH, fold change by Tb/Rudhira.</p><p>(7) Fig 4B, WB, Rudhira, fold change by Tb.</p><p>(9) Fig 4D, WB, Rudhira, loading control GAPDH, fold change by Smad2/3 silencing.</p><p>(10) Fig 5A, WB, Rudhira/Glu-Tub, loading control GAPDH, fold change by Tb and/or AcD.</p><p>(11) Fig 5C, WB, Glu-Tub.</p><p>For qPCRs:</p><p>The reader’s comment asked to display error bars if the variance in controls was considered.
