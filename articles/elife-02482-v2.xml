response. In this study, we show that SETD2, the enzyme that trimethylates histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36me3), is required for ATM activation upon DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Moreover, we find that SETD2 is necessary for homologous recombination repair of DSBs by promoting the formation of RAD51 presynaptic filaments. In agreement, SETD2-mutant clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cells displayed impaired DNA damage signaling. However, despite the persistence of DNA lesions, SETD2-deficient cells failed to activate p53, a master guardian of the genome rarely mutated in ccRCC and showed decreased cell survival after DNA damage. We propose that this novel SETD2-dependent role provides a chromatin bookmarking instrument that facilitates signaling and repair of DSBs. In ccRCC, loss of SETD2 may afford an alternative mechanism for the inactivation of the p53-mediated checkpoint without the need for additional genetic mutations in TP53.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02482.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02482.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02482.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Normal wear and tear, exposure to chemicals, and ultraviolet light can all damage DNA, so cells rely on a range of sensors and mechanisms to detect and repair damaged DNA.

The major sensor of DSBs is ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase, which is critical for the initial steps of the DNA damage response (DDR). In response to DSBs, ATM phosphorylates and regulates the activity of several substrates involved in DNA repair, such as p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) and histone H2AX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Matsuoka et al., 2007</xref>). To effectively repair a DSB, mammalian cells can choose from two different DDR pathways: nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chapman et al., 2012</xref>). During NHEJ, the broken DNA ends are blocked from 5′ end resection and held in close proximity by the Ku70-Ku80 heterodimer (Ku) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lieber, 2010</xref>). HR is initiated when the 5′ DNA ends are resected by nucleases and helicases, generating two 3′ single-stranded DNA overhangs coated with phosphorylated replication protein A (RPA) that drives the formation of a RAD51 filament prior to strand invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chapman et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast to NHEJ, which promotes direct ligation of the DSB ends in an error-prone manner and is available throughout the cell cycle, HR employs homologous sequences available after DNA replication as templates for error-free DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">San Filippo et al., 2008</xref>). Both pathways proceed through a cascade of events whereby DNA damage sensors, transducers, and effectors detect and rejoin the broken DNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harper and Elledge, 2007</xref>). All these events take place within the relatively restricted environment of chromatin, the nucleoprotein complex of histones and DNA assembled into nucleosomes. DNA damage challenges chromatin integrity by eliciting the destabilization and reorganization of its structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Soria et al., 2012</xref>). Conversely, a strictly regulated set of post-translational modifications of the histones N-terminal tails regulates the recruitment and activation of DDR factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greenberg, 2011</xref>). The most studied response of histones to DNA damage is the phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX, which serves as a molecular beacon that signals the presence of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rogakou et al., 1998</xref>). Phosphorylated H2AX (γH2AX) arises within minutes after DNA damage and has a key role in the recruitment of multiple DDR factors to the repair centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lukas et al., 2011</xref>). In addition to γH2AX, other histone modifications have been shown to play key roles during the DDR, illustrating the importance of a thorough characterization of the chromatin landscape of a DNA lesion. We have recently shown that the histone methyltransferase SETD2 (also termed KMT3 or HYPB), which is responsible for all H3K36 trimethylation, but not H3K36 mono- or dimethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Edmunds et al., 2008</xref>), acts as a determinant of chromatin integrity by regulating nucleosome dynamics during transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carvalho et al., 2013</xref>). A role of H3K36me3 in maintaining chromatin integrity was recently disclosed by the finding that the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) protein MutSα binds H3K36me3 and that SETD2 is necessary for human DNA MMR, a mechanism that corrects mismatches generated during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, whether SETD2 impinges on the cell's ability to cope with DNA DSBs is not yet known. In this study, we investigate the role of SETD2 on the cellular response to DNA DSBs. Our findings identify a novel role of this histone methyltransferase in rendering cells competent to repair DSBs. We demonstrate using powerful reporter assays that SETD2 is necessary for the DDR and that depletion of SETD2 impairs ATM activation and leads to delayed recruitment of 53BP1 to sites of DSBs. Our data further reveal that SETD2 is required for the recruitment of RAD51 to resected DNA 5′ ends and SETD2-depleted cells show reduced homology-directed repair of DSBs.</p><p><italic>SETD2</italic> mutations were recently found in several cancers, such as clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dalgliesh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duns et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Varela et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fontebasso et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Joseph et al., 2014</xref>). In ccRCC, the p53-mediated cell cycle checkpoint is frequently inactivated despite the fact that the <italic>TP53</italic> tumor suppressor gene is rarely mutated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gurova et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dalgliesh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sato et al., 2013</xref>). This puzzling observation suggests that the p53 signaling in ccRCC might be repressed by an alternative mechanism. Herein, we further investigated whether the role of SETD2 in the DDR extends to the regulation of the p53-mediated checkpoint. We show that ccRCC cells carrying inactivating mutations on <italic>SETD2</italic> phenocopy the impaired DDR observed in <italic>SETD2</italic> RNAi-depleted human cells. Importantly, SETD2 inactivation severed the p53-dependent cell cycle checkpoint despite the persistence of unrepaired DNA lesions in ccRCC cells. We propose that this unprecedented role of SETD2 in the DDR constitutes a novel tumor suppressor mechanism that could explain the high frequency of <italic>SETD2</italic> mutations found in several cancers and may provide an alternative mechanism for evasion of the p53-mediated checkpoint in <italic>TP53</italic> wt ccRCC cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SETD2 is necessary for the recruitment and activation of early DDR factors</title><p>To assay how SETD2 impinges on the cellular response to chemically induced DSBs, we monitored the DDR by measuring the dynamics of phosphorylation of the major DSB sensor ATM. Human Osteosarcoma (U2OS) cells were challenged with three different DNA-damaging agents: the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide, which is known to induce a large amount of DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burden et al., 1996</xref>) and the radiomimetic dsDNA-cleaving agents neocarzinostatin (NCS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goldberg, 1987</xref>) and phleomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moore, 1988</xref>). We depleted <italic>SETD2</italic> mRNA by RNA interference (RNAi) using three different synthetic small interfering RNA duplexes, which resulted in a global loss of the H3K36me3 histone mark that persisted throughout the entire chase periods following the DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). As a control, we used the GL2 duplex, which targets firefly luciferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elbashir et al., 2001</xref>). In control cells, the levels of H3K36me3 remained constant during the DDR and were undistinguishable from those of undamaged cells, suggesting that this histone mark is not amplified following the DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Analysis of the phosphorylation levels of ATM revealed that the DDR was promptly activated upon induction of DSBs with the three compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). ATM phosphorylation (pATM) peaked at the early time points after each treatment in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). In contrast, SETD2-depleted cells revealed a significant impairment in DNA damage signaling as revealed by decreased pATM levels detected upon treatment with each of the three drugs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). In agreement with impaired ATM activation, the phosphorylation levels of its downstream substrates H2AX and 53BP1 decreased in SETD2-depleted cells following treatment with NCS or, more appreciably, etoposide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). In DSBs induced by phleomycin, depletion of SETD2 had only a very mild impact on phosphorylation of 53BP1 or H2AX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) suggesting that either the remaining pATM is sufficient to transduce the DNA damage signaling or that alternative ATM-independent pathways operate in phleomycin-induced DSBs.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02482.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SETD2 is necessary for ATM activation during the DNA damage response.</title><p>Control and <italic>SETD2</italic> RNAi-depleted U2OS cells were challenged with etoposide (<bold>A</bold>), NCS (<bold>B</bold>) or phleomycin <bold>(C)</bold> and chased in fresh media during the indicated time points.

For that, we engineered a SETD2-GFP fusion protein and tracked it in live cells upon laser-induced DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). In agreement with the lack of fluctuations of the H3K36me3 levels following DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), SETD2-GFP did not accumulate at the laser micro-irradiated regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>Since we did not find any evidence for de novo histone H3K36 trimethylation during the DDR, we inspected if H3K36me3 is present at the nucleosomes adjacent to the sites of DSBs. In order to have single-nucleosome resolution, U2OS nuclei extracts were digested with micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Analysis of the MNase-digested extracts revealed that the majority of the DNA fragments were approximately 150 bp, which is consistent with the length of mono-nucleosomal DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, each of the four nucleosomal histones was detected in H3K36me3 pull downs, indicating that isolated nucleosomes remained intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). 53BP1 and H3K36me3 were immunopurified from the mono-nucleosome preparations, and the complexes were immunobloted with antibodies against γH2AX and H3K36me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). In control (i.e., undamaged) cells, γH2AX was neither detected in the input sample (total cell lysates) nor in any of the two pull-downs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Upon treatment with NCS a robust signal for γH2AX was observed in the input lane and in the samples immunopurified with antibodies against 53BP1 or H3K36me3, indicating the activation of the DDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). These data reveal that both 53BP1 and H3K36me3 are present in the same nucleosomes that acquire γH2AX upon DNA damage. Moreover, 53BP1 was detected in complexes immunoprecipitated with the H3K36me3 antibody upon induction of DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This suggests that H3K36me3 decorates at least a fraction of the nucleosomes to which 53BP1 binds. Altogether, these findings further support the view that H3K36me3 contributes to the establishment of the chromatin state that coordinates the recruitment and activation of DDR factors, even though SETD2 is not actively recruited to DNA damage sites.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>SETD2 is required for RAD51 recruitment during homologous recombination repair</title><p>The binding of 53BP1 to damaged chromatin tilts the balance between the DNA repair pathways towards NHEJ by preventing 5′ end resection of the broken DNA ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouwman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bunting et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chapman et al., 2012</xref>).

Our present findings suggest that impaired DDR proficiency constitutes a hallmark of <italic>SETD2</italic> mutant cancers and could reveal a novel mechanism through which SETD2 suppresses tumor development and growth. To further test this view, we inspected the DDR in ccRCC cell lines containing inactivating mutations in <italic>SETD2</italic> that result in a strong reduction of H3K36me3 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duns et al., 2010</xref>).

In agreement with the impaired ATM activation, spreading of γH2AX and 53BP1 phosphorylation was greatly compromised in SETD2-depleted cells treated with NCS or etoposide, but only marginally affected in DSBs induced by phleomycin. These findings suggest that the DNA damage signaling may follow multiple pathways with different requirements for H3K36me3 and can result in phosphorylation of H2AX and 53BP1 independently of ATM activation. In fact, ionizing radiation-induced H2AX phosphorylation and recruitment of 53BP1 to DSBs can be carried out by ATM and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) in a redundant manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stiff et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) can also phosphorylate many of the ATM substrates, including H2AX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ward and Chen, 2001</xref>).</p><p>53BP1 nucleation at DNA-damaged chromatin plays an important role in favoring DNA repair by NHEJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouwman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bunting et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chapman et al., 2012</xref>). In agreement, we found that induction of DSBs resulted in a significant impairment of the 53BP1 recruitment and increased DNA 5′ end resection in SETD2-depleted cells. However, the increased resection did not reflect increased efficiency of HR repair. Instead, persistent DNA 5′ end resection is likely due to the roadblock in the HR pathway that is created by the failure of RAD51 binding to the single-stranded DNA. Indeed, this defect in presynaptic filament formation on the resected DNA resulted in a 50% reduction in the efficiency of gene conversion of the DR-GFP HR reporter. Exonuclease-mediated resection of DNA ends is known to promote phosphorylation of RPA and to orchestrate an ATM-to-ATR switch at DNA breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shiotani and Zou, 2009</xref>). This switch in the main DNA damage sensor provides a reasonable explanation for the RPA phosphorylation and the proficient RPA recruitment to DSBs despite the impaired ATM activation in SETD2-depleted cells. Alternatively, ATM-independent RPA phosphorylation can also be achieved through the activity of DNA-PK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shao et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anantha et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Lens-epithelium-derived growth factor p75 splice variant (LEDGF) is an H3K36me3-binding protein that promotes the HR repair of DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daugaard et al., 2012</xref>). Depletion of LEDGF impairs the recruitment of CtIP and the subsequent DNA 5′ end resection of DSBs. While defects in LEDGF recruitment to DSBs may account for the impaired HR phenotype that we report in SETD2 deficient cells, our data supports an extended LEDGF-independent role of SETD2 in the repair of DSBs by HR. Our findings that DNA 5′ end resection and RPA foci formation are not severely compromised in SETD2-depleted cells disclose a specific presynaptic role for SETD2 that is necessary for the recruitment of RAD51 to single-stranded DNA. One possibility is that H3K36me3 defines a local chromatin state that favors the recruitment of RAD51 to DSBs and successful HR repair. This could be achieved by the FACT histone chaperone upon recruitment to H3K36me3-marked nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carvalho et al., 2013</xref>). In agreement with this view, depletion of the FACT subunit SPT16 results in a major impairment of HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kari et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oliveira et al., 2014</xref>). FACT is required to recruit the ubiquitin ligase RNF20, which in turn facilitates RAD51 accumulation at DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oliveira et al., 2014</xref>). The view that changes in chromatin dynamics may affect RAD51 function is not completely unexpected as illustrated by the role of the histone acetyltransferase 1 (HAT1) in RAD51 during HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). HAT1 promotes acetylation of histone H4, as well as incorporation of histone variant H3.3 at DSBs and facilitates RAD51 recruitment and efficient HR repair. Nevertheless, the major impact of SETD2 on RNA polymerase II transcription and pre-mRNA processing that others and we have previously described (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Almeida and Carmo-Fonseca, 2014</xref>) discloses the alternative possibility that the impaired formation of RAD51 filaments and HR may result from disrupted gene expression of key DNA repair factors. Hence, additional studies are needed to fully elucidate the mechanistic basis of the SETD2 impact on the DDR.</p><p>Unlike all histone modifications found to promote the DDR, previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pei et al., 2011</xref>) and our data show no evidence of increased H3K36me3 levels at the DNA damage sites or of a DDR-dependent recruitment of SETD2 to DSBs. These findings disclose an unprecedented role for a histone-modifying enzyme in priming intact chromatin for the response to DNA damage. A model that emphasizes the regulation of the H3K36me3 accessibility as a major determinant of the DDR can be envisaged. According to this view, the conformational changes that occur after a DSB may cause exposure of H3K36me3 marks previously written by SETD2 in intact chromatin, for instance during transcription by RNA polymerase II or replication. In fact, a careful inspection of the nucleosome structure reveals that lysine 36 on the N-terminal tail of histone H3 does not protrude from the nucleosome core. Instead, this lysine is hidden by the DNA double strand that wraps the histone octameric core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luger et al., 1997</xref>). This sheltered location was first described three decades ago, when Crane–Robinson et al. investigated the accessibility of the histone-terminal domains to proteases. Their experiments revealed that while the first 26 N-terminal residues of histone H3 were greatly sensitive to trypsin digestion, H3K36 was resistant to the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bohm et al., 1981</xref>). According to this ‘break and access model’ DNA damage exposes H3K36me3, which then contributes together with a set of well-defined histone modifications to the orchestration of the chromatin landscape that drives the initial recruitment and activation of DDR factors, such as ATM.</p><p>The role of H3K36me3 in promoting repair of DSBs by HR may be particularly relevant at coding regions, where the introduction of genomic aberrations is likely to have deleterious consequences. Therefore, in these regions the choice between error-prone NHEJ and the more reliable HR pathway is of utmost importance. In fact, most H3K36me3 is found at actively transcribed chromatin where it signals the recruitment of the histone chaperone FACT to reassemble nucleosomes in the wake of RNA polymerase II elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carvalho et al., 2013</xref>). Should a DSB amputate a coding region, exposure of H3K36me3 previously deposited by SETD2 traveling with the transcriptional machinery may promote DNA repair by HR and would guarantee the integrity of the genetic information.</p><p>From all cancers on which <italic>SETD2</italic> mutations have been reported, ccRCC shows the highest mutation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dalgliesh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Varela et al., 2011</xref>). Our present findings reveal that <italic>SETD2</italic> mutant ccRCC cells have impaired DDR signaling which leads to inefficient repair of DNA damage. However, the p53-dependent cell cycle checkpoint is not activated in SETD2-deficient cells despite the persistence of DNA damage. Depletion of SETD2 abrogates p53 activation, and leads to eviction of the G1/S checkpoint upon DNA damage. In addition to the defects in the DNA damage signaling that we found in SETD2-depleted cells, which could extend to improper p53 activation, it is also possible that SETD2 impinges directly on p53 activity and activation of its downstream targets through direct protein–protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xie et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, in the absence of SETD2, the capacity for clonogenic survival following DNA damage is significantly reduced. These findings integrate SETD2 into the p53 regulatory network and provide a reasonable explanation for the intriguing observation that inactivation of this master regulator of cell cycle checkpoints in ccRCC is rarely caused by mutations in <italic>TP53</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gurova et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dalgliesh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sato et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>A plethora of recent studies have revealed that mutation rates and genomic instabilities in cancer are directly related to aberrant histone modifications and chromatin organization, underscoring the importance of the histone code in maintaining genome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lukas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Papamichos-Chronakis and Peterson, 2013</xref>).

The present study provides a functional link between these two events extending our understanding of the impact of altered chromatin states on the mechanisms that maintain genome integrity. Although it is now evident that alterations in histone modifications are a hallmark of most cancers, it is still unclear whether these changes are drivers or passengers of tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Waldmann and Schneider, 2013</xref>). Our findings endorse the classification of SETD2 as a tumor suppressor and place inactivating mutations in this histone modifier at the peak of a harmful cascade of events that may ultimately drive malignant cell transformation and tumor development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and drug treatments</title><p>Human osteosarcoma (U2OS) cells (ATCC) and the ccRCC cells RCC-JW, Caki-2, RCC-MF and RCC-FG2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duns et al., 2010</xref>) (Cell Line Services Eppelheim, Germany) were grown as monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium–DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS, 1% (vol/vol) nonessential amino acids, 1% (vol/vol) L-glutamine, and 100U/ml penicillin-streptomycin, and maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this interesting paper, Carvalho et al report a novel role for the lysine methyl-transferase SETD2 in the DNA damage response (DDR). They demonstrate that SETD2 depletion impairs several key signaling events downstream of DNA double-stranded breaks, including phosphorylation of ATM, H2A.X and 53BP1, recruitment of 53BP1 to sites of DNA damage, and formation of Rad51 foci, but not RPA recruitment. Depletion of SETD2 also produces a defect in DNA repair via homologous recombination (HR) and a defect in p53 activation after DNA damage. These findings are also reproduced in clear cell renal carcinoma cell lines carrying SETD2 mutations. The reviewers found these findings to be of high impact and significant, because loss-of-function mutations in SETD2 have been recently documented in various malignancies, suggesting that SETD2 is a bona fide tumor suppressor. The findings in this report may explain, at least in part, how SETD2 suppresses tumor growth.</p><p>However, the reviewers discussed how the mechanistic aspects of the paper could have been more developed. In particular, the reviewers noted the difficulty in dissecting direct effects (i.e., SETD2 acting at the sites of DNA damage via H3K36 methylation) versus indirect SETD2 action (i.e., via transcriptional effects). In the end, the reviewers agreed that the paper would merit publication in a high impact journal such as <italic>eLife</italic> by including additional experiments and controls that would significantly strengthen the main conclusions, even if further mechanistic insight was not provided.</p><p>Therefore, the major concerns that will have to be addressed for this manuscript to be considered for publication are:</p><p>1) A key conclusion in the manuscript, stated in the title, is that SETD2 is involved in the 'p53 activation checkpoint'. However, this is based merely on p53 and p21 Western blots. Although p53 and p21 levels are lower in SETD2 deficient cells, no work is performed on the checkpoint itself so the title of the figure is misleading and overstated. A direct measurement of the G1 checkpoint should be performed with and without SETD2 to strengthen this statement. Cells can be damaged with IR (or phleo, bleo if not available) followed by a time course using FACS analysis to measure DNA content and G1 arrested cells. siControl and siSETD2 cells can be compared to see if indeed depletion of SETD2 affects the p53-dependent checkpoint at the level of the cell cycle as reported by the authors. In addition, clonogenic DNA damage sensitivity assays with these agents would help show that these defects observed in SETD2 defective cells actually have some biological consequence. As a suggestion, Etoposide should not be used as this response is dependent on TOP2, which might be altered in SETD2 depleted cells. Although this could be interesting, the results would be indirect and these experiments are suggested to look at direct effects of SETD2 upon DNA damage on the p53 checkpoint (see point 2).</p><p>2) Many of the key experiments inducing DNA double-stranded breaks were done with etoposide, a topoisomerase II inhibitor (such as phospho-H2AX formation). Since TOP2 is involved in transcription, it is important to repeat these experiments with other agents that cause double-stranded breaks by other mechanisms, such as neocarcinostatin (NCS), and ionizing radiation (IR, or a radiomimetic drug such as phleomycin or bleomycin). To what the degree the defects in DNA damage-induced signaling observed in SETD2-depleted cells can be reproduced with these other agents? More specifically, the reviewers would like to know if other signaling events, such as ATM, H2A.X, 53BP1 and p53 activation are also impaired in SETD2-depleted cells after treatment with these other agents.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> does not provide enough information for the results to be judged. Information about what time point this data represents and what the cutting efficiency is should be provided. Additionally, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, all cells show similar amounts of RPA after NCS. G1 cells should not show RPA similarly to S/G2 cells since NHEJ is the more prominent DNA repair pathway. Are all of these cells in S/G2? No cell cycle analysis beyond a FACS profile is provided and since resection, DNA repair and DNA damage signaling are regulated throughout the cell cycle, a more careful analysis is warranted. This can be accomplished by using Cyclin A staining in the IF analysis to indicate S/G2 cells and G1 cells that will lack Cyclin A staining. No information is provided for why RAD51, but not RPA, are defective in SETD2 deficient cells. Could the authors discuss a possible mechanism? LEDGF has been shown to bind transcription marks including H3K36me3 and be involved in DNA repair (Daugaard et al. NSMB, 2012) but how SETD2 relates to this work is not discussed. Can you detect defects in CTIP, BRCA1 and/or LEDGF recruitment to damage sites in the absence of SETD2? This data would allow a deeper understanding of what aspect of HR are regulated by SETD2.</p><p>4) The immunofluorescence-based DNA damage assays such in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure1B</xref> (γH2AX) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure3C</xref> (RPA) should be performed in a quantitative manner, similar to that of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>.</p><p>5) The experiments attempted to address the if K36me3 is present at the nucleosomes adjacent to DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) are problematic in several aspects:</p><p>a) To prepare mono-nucleosomes, the common nuclease of choice is MNase. However, the authors used DNase I, which efficiently cleave nucleosomal DNA at minor grooves, and Benzonase, which is even less proven enzyme to specifically digest linker DNA. More importantly, the nuclei DNA digestion pattern indicated a potential over-digestion (DNA fragment is smaller than 147bp), and there is no evidence that nucleosomes remain intact. This experiment should be repeated with MNase.</p><p>b) H2A, H2B and H4 western should be included in nucleosome pull-down when H3 antibodies are used.</p><p>c) In control cells (Left), when comparing IP to the input, K36me3 IP seems to put down K4me2 more efficiently than K36me3. This result would suggest that K4me2 co-occupies almost completely with K36me3, which is NOT consistent with numerous mass-spec studies and genome-wide analysis. The authors should elaborate on this result.</p><p>6) To rule out indirect transcriptional effect caused by Setd2 knockdown, the authors settled to merely analyze the published RNA-seq data in Set2 depleted cells. However, this is not a correct analysis for this purpose. Gene expression comparison should have been done between WT and Setd2-KD cells under DNA damage induced conditions. This analysis should be done in WT and Setd2-KD cells under DNA damage induced conditions or removed from the manuscript entirely. If the authors decide to remove this section, they should acknowledge in the text the possibility of indirect SETD2 action via undefined transcriptional effects.</p><p>7) The “Break &amp; access model” proposed by authors in the Discussion section makes no sense to the reviewer for the following reasons:</p><p>a) Recombinant Setd2 homologs in human, <italic>Drosophila,</italic> and yeast all show stronger activity toward nucleosomal substrates than histones; b) The works from the Briggs' lab (Du et al 2008 G&amp;D and 2010 JBC) clearly showed that H2A surface is required for Set2-mediated K36me3; c) Based on the structure, the removal of H2A/H2B bears no influence on “disclose H3K36 substrates for Setd2-dependent trimethylation”. Please modify the model to more accurately depict the results obtained and the current state of knowledge.</p><p>Experiments using clear cell renal carcinoma cell lines involve only one of each wild type SETD2 versus mutant SETD2. Given that these cell lines are not isogenic, it is imperative to reproduce the key findings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6 fig7">Figures 5, 6 and 7</xref> in at least one other pair of wild type and mutant SET2D.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02482.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) A key conclusion in the manuscript, stated in the title, is that SETD2 is involved in the 'p53 activation checkpoint'.

Following the reviewers’ request, we now provide direct measurements of the G1/S checkpoint upon DNA damage with phleomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). These additional data support our conclusion that depletion of SETD2 affects the p53-dependent checkpoint at the level of the cell cycle. In addition, we analyzed the clonogenic survival of SETD2-depleted cells treated with phleomycin as requested by the reviewers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). These experiments revealed that this histone methyltransferase increases the cell survival rate in response to DNA damage.</p><p><italic>2) Many of the key experiments inducing DNA double-stranded breaks were done with etoposide, a topoisomerase II inhibitor (such as phospho-H2AX formation).

These new data show that:</p><p>a) Defects in the DNA damage signaling are observed in SETD2-depleted cells independently of the DNA damaging drug, as revealed by the impaired ATM activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B and C</xref>).</p><p>Upon induction of double-strand breaks with etoposide or NCS, H2AX and 53BP1 were phosphorylated in a SETD2-dependent manner, contrasting with the predominant SETD2-independent phosphorylation observed after treatment with phleomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B and C</xref>). These differences are discussed in the manuscript. In light of these new findings, we decided to remove the γH2AX immunofluorescence staining originally shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, as this does not seem to represent a general effect of SETD2 on the DDR. Instead, the DNA damage signaling appears to follow multiple pathways with different requirements for H3K36me3 that can lead to phosphorylation of H2AX and 53BP1 independently of ATM activation.</p><p>b) Activation of p53 in response to etoposide, NCS or phleomycin was consistently affected by depletion of SETD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B, C and D</xref>).</p><p>These data confirm that DNA damage signaling and p53 activation are compromised in SETD2-depleted cells and suggest that alternative mechanisms may drive SETD2-independent H2AX and 53BP1 phosphorylation in response to phleomycin-induced DSBs.</p><p><italic>3)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4A</italic></xref> <italic>does not provide enough information for the results to be judged.

We have repeated the RPA immunofluorescence using Cyclin A staining in parallel. These new data is shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and shows that only Cyclin A-positive cells have RPA foci upon DNA damage. Moreover, we have also repeated the RAD51 immunofluorescence with Cyclin A co-staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p><italic>No information is provided for why RAD51, but not RPA, are defective in SETD2 deficient cells.

The proposed mechanism involves the recruitment of the histone chaperone FACT by H3K36me3 that in turn promotes the formation of RAD51 filaments on resected DNA ends (see Discussion). Moreover, we provide an integrated view of our novel findings with the role of LEDGF in HR repair. While LEDGF may contribute to the aberrant DDR phenotype that we observe in SETD2-depleted cells, we reason that a novel, LEDGF-independent role of SETD2 is necessary for RAD51 recruitment and HR repair. Following the suggestion made by the reviewers, we analyzed BRCA1 recruitment to DSBs by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). These new data show that formation of BRCA1 foci in response to NCS is not affected by depletion of SETD2, thus supporting our conclusion that SETD2 plays a presynaptic role that is necessary for the recruitment of RAD51 to DSBs.</p><p><italic>4) The immunofluorescence-based DNA damage assays such in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure1B</italic></xref> <italic>(γH2AX) and</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure3C</italic></xref> <italic>(RPA) should be performed in a quantitative manner, similar to that of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3D</italic></xref>.</p><p>We now include these data on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and on the new BRCA1 immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> was removed from the revised manuscript (see response to point #2)<italic>.</italic></p><p><italic>5) The experiments attempted to address the if K36me3 is present at the nucleosomes adjacent to DSBs (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2E</italic></xref><italic>) are problematic in several aspects</italic>:</p><p><italic>a) To prepare mono-nucleosomes, the common nuclease of choice is MNase.
