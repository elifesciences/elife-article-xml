Several molecules involved in myoblast fusion have been discovered, and finger-like projections coincident with myoblast fusion have also been implicated in the fusion process. The role of these cellular projections in muscle cell fusion was investigated herein. We demonstrate that these projections are filopodia generated by class X myosin (Myo10), an unconventional myosin motor protein specialized for filopodia. We further show that Myo10 is highly expressed by differentiating myoblasts, and Myo10 ablation inhibits both filopodia formation and myoblast fusion in vitro. In vivo, Myo10 labels regenerating muscle fibers associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and acute muscle injury. In mice, conditional loss of <italic>Myo10</italic> from muscle-resident stem cells, known as satellite cells, severely impairs postnatal muscle regeneration. Furthermore, the muscle fusion proteins Myomaker and Myomixer are detected in myoblast filopodia. These data demonstrate that Myo10-driven filopodia facilitate multinucleated mammalian muscle formation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>myogenesis</kwd><kwd>myosin x</kwd><kwd>filopodia</kwd><kwd>satellite cells</kwd><kwd>cell fusion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-AR075637</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sweeney</surname><given-names>H Lee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54-AR-052646</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sweeney</surname><given-names>H Lee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001674</institution-id><institution>Fondation Leducq</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>13CVD04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sweeney</surname><given-names>H Lee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005202</institution-id><institution>Muscular Dystrophy Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MDA549004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hammers</surname><given-names>David W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM134531</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheney</surname><given-names>Richard E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hammer</surname><given-names>John A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32CA009156</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heimsath</surname><given-names>Ernest G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Filopodia driven by class X myosin promote the fusion of mammalian myoblasts in the development of skeletal muscle and are important for the regeneration of skeletal muscle following muscle injury.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The development, growth, and repair of vertebrate skeletal muscle is largely mediated by the ability of myoblasts to fuse with each other and with pre-existing muscle fibers. In postnatal muscle, this fusion process is initiated by the activation of muscle-resident stem cells, known as satellite cells, which normally remain in a quiescent state positioned between the sarcolemma and basement membrane of muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mauro, 1961</xref>). Following an activation stimulus, satellite cells give rise to myoblast progeny which proliferate, differentiate, and fuse to bring the muscle back to homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Charge and Rudnicki, 2004</xref>).</p><p>The fusion of mammalian myoblasts requires the merging of two apposing lipid bilayers and has been shown to involve several widely expressed protein classes, including cytoskeleton elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Charrasse et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Randrianarison-Huetz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vasyutina et al., 2009</xref>), phagocytosis receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hamoud et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hochreiter-Hufford et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Park et al., 2016</xref>), and calcium-sensing membrane repair proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leikina et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Posey et al., 2011</xref>). Myomaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Millay et al., 2013</xref>) and Myomixer (aka Myomerger and Minion; the product of the <italic>Gm7325</italic> gene; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Quinn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>) have been identified as being membrane proteins essential for myoblast fusion. Current evidence suggests that Myomaker is required by both fusing cells, while the requirement for Myomixer is only unilateral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Quinn et al., 2017</xref>). However, the mechanisms regulating the function of these proteins are currently unknown.</p><p>Thin, actin-filled projections have been observed during the fusion of murine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Randrianarison-Huetz et al., 2018</xref>) and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gurevich et al., 2016</xref>) myoblasts. These structures appear to be filopodia, which are thin, membrane-enclosed projections of actin bundles that are important for cellular behaviors such as path finding during migration, interaction with the extracellular matrix, and cell-to-cell communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mattila and Lappalainen, 2008</xref>). The actin cytoskeleton is well established as an enactor of <italic>Drosophila</italic> myoblast fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abmayr and Pavlath, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen, 2011</xref>), with filopodia suggested to be involved in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Segal et al., 2016</xref>). Despite actin cytoskeletal involvement in the fusion of both vertebrate and arthropod myoblasts, no members of the myosin superfamily of molecular motors have been reported to have a direct role in the muscle fusion process.</p><p>Myosin superfamily members perform actin-associated functions in all cell types. This includes the conventional (class II) myosins, such as those that power muscle contraction, and several classes of ‘unconventional’ myosins, of which 11 are expressed in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berg et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Odronitz and Kollmar, 2007</xref>). These unconventional myosins employ the same basic motor mechanism as conventional myosins, but have unique tail domains that allow them to perform specialized cellular functions. Class X myosin (Myo10) is an unconventional myosin involved in the formation and elongation of filopodia in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berg and Cheney, 2002</xref>). Myo10 consists of an N-terminal motor domain, a lever arm with three calmodulin-binding sites and a single alpha helical domain, and a C-terminal tail containing a pleckstrin homology (PH), a myosin tail homology 4 (MyTH4), and a 4.1/Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin (FERM) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kerber and Cheney, 2011</xref>). Upon activation, Myo10 forms an anti-parallel dimer that is optimized for the organization and movement along actin bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ropars et al., 2016</xref>). Myo10-driven filopodia are involved in processes such as neural and vascular development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heimsath et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhu et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Because filopodia-like structures have been observed in fusing muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gurevich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Randrianarison-Huetz et al., 2018</xref>), we sought to determine if these structures are, indeed, Myo10-driven filopodia involved in skeletal muscle fusion. In this work, we show that Myo10, a filopodia-associated myosin, is a key component of myoblast fusion. Myo10 deficiency in myoblasts results in loss of detectable filopodia and muscle fusion in vitro and impaired muscle regeneration in vivo. Lastly, we demonstrate that the fusion proteins Myomaker and Myomixer can be detected within muscle filopodia.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Protrusions from differentiating myoblasts are apparent during cellular fusion</title><p>Thin actin-filled cellular extensions that protrude from differentiating myoblasts have been observed during vertebrate myofusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Randrianarison-Huetz et al., 2018</xref>). We sought to investigate the occurrence and behaviors of these projections in living myoblasts of both undifferentiated and differentiated states via live-cell confocal microscopy, utilizing membrane targeted fluorescent reporter constructs containing a C-terminal human H-Ras CAAX box prenylation signal (RFP-CAAX or GFP-CAAX; see Materials and methods) to enable detailed visualization of cellular protrusions. Undifferentiated myoblasts of the murine C2C12 cell line exhibit many thin cellular projections. Live imaging reveals that these projections are actively elongating primarily at the leading edge of myoblasts, while the trailing regions of the cells predominantly exhibit retraction fibers that become evident as the cells move (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>; summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), as commonly observed during cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mattila and Lappalainen, 2008</xref>). Upon induction of differentiation by switching the cells to low-serum media conditions, myoblasts undergo morphological changes characterized by cellular elongation, loss of distinct directional polarity, and increased incidence of cellular projections from the entirety of the cell body (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). As the differentiation process proceeds to the formation of multinucleated myotubes, the cells display an array of dynamic and static projections at the lateral edges, prominent dorsal protrusions along the cell body, and arm-like lamellipodial extensions adorned with thin projections that can protrude from any part of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Videos 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">7</xref>; summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The lengths of extending projections from myotubes are significantly longer than those from the leading edge of myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), and scanning electron micrographs confirm that these dorsal projections from myotubes are of consistent structure and size of thin, actin-based cellular projections known as filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Live imaging of differentiating myoblast cultures reveals the involvement of these structures in muscle cell fusion, as witnessed through fusion induced by projections extending from the lateral edge of myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Video 8</xref>), as well as by projection-laden lamellipodial extensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video9">Videos 9</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video10">10</xref>). This evidence demonstrates that these cellular projections extending from differentiating myoblasts are involved in the formation of multinucleated mammalian muscle.

Only the conventional myosin, non-muscle myosin II, has been implicated in myoblast fusion, serving as a sub-sarcolemmal mechanosensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). The current report also provides the first described role of Myo10 in mammalian muscle, which has only been previously detected in muscle via dystrophic muscle gene expression arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marotta et al., 2009</xref>) and <italic>Myo10</italic> promoter binding by the muscle regulatory factors MyoD and Myogenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, a myosin motor involved in myoblast fusion has not been identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which lack Myo10.

A recent study has demonstrated that loss of Myo15 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> substantially reduces larva viability and causes abnormal neuromuscular junction formation, whereas muscle-specific Myo15 overexpression causes the development of peculiar F-actin structures in myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rich et al., 2021</xref>). While this report did not address whether these actin-based structures are associated with cellular protrusions, the images provided do resemble thin actin bundles reminiscent of myotube dorsal filopodia described in the current study. While the definitive identification of a myosin motor that drives insect muscle filopodia awaits further investigation, the premise of filopodia-facilitated myoblast fusion appears to be a convergent evolutionary feature of multinucleated muscle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Segal et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the physical presentation of molecules at a distance from the cell body via cytoskeletal extensions is an important aspect of skeletal muscle development as it is in the development of other tissue types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhu et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>A paramount finding of this report is the defective muscle regeneration caused by loss of Myo10 in satellite cells. These data are potentially of clinical significance, as a patient having two alleles for a truncating <italic>MYO10</italic> mutation has been recently identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Patel et al., 2018</xref>). While this individual was found on basis of having microphthalmia, a developmental eye defect, it is possible that an underlying myopathy may exist or develop as a result of impairments in muscle recovery from injury. In fact, microphthalmia is also associated with several syndromes that also present with myopathy or neuromuscular disorders, including Walker-Walburg syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vajsar and Schachter, 2006</xref>) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fernandez-Torre et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, several <italic>MYO10</italic> single-nucleotide polymorphisms have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burghardt et al., 2010</xref>), including missense mutations in the N-terminal motor domain. Mutations such as these have the potential to create dominant-negative Myo10 molecules if motor function is impaired or destroyed, and individuals harboring such polymorphisms may exhibit muscle regenerative defects, as demonstrated by loss of <italic>Myo10</italic> in mice. The identification of a Myo10-deficient patient also confirms findings in mice that loss of Myo10 is not absolutely lethal, although less than half of Myo10-null mice survive birth, and those that do survive exhibit developmental deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heimsath et al., 2017</xref>). These evidences of decreased Myo10-null embryonic survivability further indicate that Myo10-driven filopodia serve to increase the probability of proper cellular connectivity during developmental processes. The fact that the surviving Myo10-null animals have fused muscle fibers likely indicates that myoblasts are in close opposition during development, lessening the dependence on distal interactions mediated by filopodia. In contrast, satellite cell-derived myoblasts of injured adult muscles must traverse much larger distances in order to locate and fuse with each other, creating a greater dependence on filopodia for postnatal muscle repair than for embryonic muscle development.</p><p>Following confirmation that Myo10-driven filopodia are involved in the fusion events required to form multinucleated muscle, we investigated if there is a relationship between these fine cellular projections and the recently discovered muscle fusion proteins, Myomaker and Myomixer. Our experiments reveal that Myomaker and Myomixer are both highly expressed in Myo10-positive myocytes and present in muscle filopodia. It is currently hypothesized that Myomaker’s role in cellular fusion is the promotion of outer membrane leaflet mixing (i.e. hemifusion) between cells, while Myomixer acts as an inducer of intercellular pore formation by promoting positive spontaneous membrane curvature within hemifusion structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Golani et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leikina et al., 2018</xref>). These actions are consistent with the concept of their delivery by Myo10-driven filopodia in order to create an intermediate structure that is essentially a tunneling nanotube, whether configured as individual or bundled lumens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sartori-Rupp et al., 2019</xref>), that precedes development of a full syncytium. Such a structural organization is suggested by the images provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, and Myo10-dependent formation of tunneling nanotubes has been suggested as a requirement for osteoclast differentiation into multinucleated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tasca et al., 2017</xref>). While it remains to be confirmed if Myo10 plays an active role in the localization and/or activity of these fusogenic proteins or whether Myo10-driven filopodia increase the probability proper cellular connectivity via increased surface area, the failure of a C-terminal Myo10 truncation (RFP-Myo10ΔCBD) to restore myoblast fusogenic activity, despite promoting filopodia formation, suggests Myo10 does have an active cargo-binding role in promoting fusion of mammalian myoblasts. Furthermore, the apparent requirement of Myo10 by both fusing cells, a feature also exhibited by Myomaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Quinn et al., 2017</xref>), suggests that Myomaker fusogenic activity may depend on filopodia driven by full-length (cargo-binding competent) Myo10.</p><p>The findings detailed in this report describe a role of filopodia driven by the unconventional myosin, Myo10, in the formation of multinucleated skeletal muscle. These data further emphasize the importance of these fine cellular projections in the intricate biological processes required for proper development of higher-order organisms, and that perturbations to their formation and function have the ability to cause muscle pathology and potentially modify the course of muscle disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Filopodia powered by class X myosin promote fusion of mammalian myoblasts&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Pekka Lappalainen as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Leonid Chernomordik (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Filopodia have been implicated in cell-cell fusion during muscle development in both flies and zebrafish, but the precise role of these actin-rich protrusions in muscle development remains unknown. Myo10 is an unconventional myosin that is linked to filopodia formation in many cell-types. The study by Hammers et al. reveals that Myo10 is upregulated during myoblast differentiation and muscle regeneration. By taking advantage of both a mouse C2C12 cell-line and conditional Myo10 knockout mice, they demonstrate that Myo10-dependent filopodia are important for myoblast fusion during muscle differentiation in vitro, and provide strong evidence that Myo10 is also critical for muscle development and regeneration in vivo</p><p>All three reviewers found this study interesting, and felt that the knockout and knockdown experiments presented in the manuscript convincingly demonstrate the role of Myo10 in myoblast fusion. While reviewer #1 was more positive, the two other reviewers (although still very supportive about the importance of this study) stated the underlying mechanism remains elusive, and thus the manuscript is not suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> in its present form. Therefore, it would be important to provide some mechanistic insight into how Myo10 -generated filopodia contribute to myoblast fusion (by 1. Performing careful, quantitative imaging of the myoblast fusion process, 2. Uncovering if the requirement of Myo10-dependent filopodia in this process is unidirectional or bidirectional, and 3. Characterizing a FERM deletion mutant of Myo10 to elucidate if interaction of this protein with cadherins/integrins is needed for myoblast fusion. ). Moreover, some imaging experiments, including the ones on myomaker and myomixer, are not particularly convincing, and whether these proteins are indeed enriched in filopodia, remains unclear. Thus, the imaging data should be improved throughout the manuscript, and one should provide careful quantification of the data to support the conclusions. Detailed comments by the three reviewers are below.</p><p>Because the policy of <italic>eLife</italic> is to invite a revision only if the suggested experiments can be carried out in 2-3 months, we cannot unfortunately offer to publish this study in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, all three reviewers found this work very interesting and important. Thus, if you can address main points listed by the three reviewers, and provide some mechanistic insight into how Myo10/filopodia contribute to myoblast fusion, we will be glad to consider a new submission on this topic for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. In such case, the new submission would be evaluated by the three original reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Actin-rich filopodia-like protrusions participate in myoblast fusion, and at least in <italic>Drosophila</italic> filopodial proteins Enabled and IRSp53 are critical for myoblast-myotube fusion. However, the precise molecular composition of filopodia that contribute to myoblast fusion, especially in vertebrates, is incompletely understood. Here, Hammers et al. provide evidence that class X myosin (Myo10) is an important component of myoblast fusion in mammals. They show that expression of Myo10 is upregulated during myoblast differentiation and muscle regeneration, and that Myo10 drives the formation of filopodia in myoblasts. Importantly, they demonstrate that deletion of Myo10 leads to defects in myoblast fusion in vitro and for muscle regeneration in vivo. This manuscript provides important new information on the mechanisms of myoblast fusion. However, there are few points that should be addressed to strengthen the study.</p><p>The images on the localization of Myomaker and Myomixer along filopodia in differentiating muscle cells are not convincing. For example, from Figure 5B it appears that Myomixer does not localize to filopodia and also Myomaker vesicles display only very occasional localization to filopodia. Thus, the authors should repeat these experiments to obtain better quality images, or tone down their conclusions about localization of myogenic fusion proteins to filopodia.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Filopodia have been strongly implicated in mediating cell-cell fusion during muscle development in both flies and zebrafish. The exact role of these cellular protrusions in muscle development remains unknown. Hammers et al. implicate filopodia generated by the unconventional myosin Myo10 as key mediators of myoblast fusion during muscle development and suggest that they are important for delivering the muscle fusogens Myomaker and Myomixer to target cells. Most interestingly, the work also strongly implicates filopodia in having a major role during muscle regeneration following injury.</p><p>The authors take good advantage of both the mouse C2C12 line and a conditional Myo10 KO mouse to highlight the importance of filopodia in muscle. The results clearly and convincingly show that Myo10-dependent filopodia play a critical role in myoblast fusion during muscle differentiation in vitro and also strongly implicate them in fusion in vivo, providing a new perspective on the mechanism of muscle development and regeneration. However, while the findings are highly interesting and the results supportive of the author's conclusions, the paper itself is lacking compelling data showing that filopodia-driven contact between myoblasts is the key initiating event or plays a significant role in promoting fusion. This conclusion is logically consistent with all of the data and a number of images and videos are quite suggestive. However, few examples of filopodia interacting with a target cell are shown, they are not always clear and, most importantly, there is a lack of quantitative support for a high frequency of 'first contact' or significant contact between filopodia and their target cell. Furthermore, the broad membrane localization of Myomaker and Myomixer to the surface of differentiating myoblasts makes it difficult to know if the presence of these fusogens in filopodia is really critical for fusion (i.e. are filopodia playing a major role in delivering these to the target cell for fusion). The available data, both from this work and that of others, suggests that there is a high likelihood that filopodia are key critical drivers of myoblast fusion. The inclusion of stronger data showing their interaction with a target cell would make this conclusion more compelling.</p><p>1. Thin extensions the size of filopodia are present at the front, sides and rear of undifferentiated, migrating myoblasts, as visualized in cells expressing RFP- or GFP-CAXX (Figure 1A; Figure S1 A). The filopodia are said to be preferentially extended from the leading edge of the cell and the observed lateral and rear extensions are said to be retraction fibers.

Video 8 shows fusion of the lateral edges of myotubes. The initial projection is clear to see, but the video is rather choppy and it is difficult to clearly follow the interaction between filopodia or membrane extensions of the two cells. Similarly, it is hard to appreciate the membrane fusion events in Video 9.</p><p>3. Integrin b1 staining is indeed enriched at the front of the differentiating myoblast, but it is hard to visualize integrin B1 within the Myo10-positive filopodia themselves (Figure 2D).</p><p>4. A striking loss of myoblast fusion is observed after 7 days of differentiation when Myo10 is depleted (Figure 3F). Apart from the loss of filopodia, which is also significant (Figure 3E), are there any other noticeable defects in the cells, such as reduced adhesion that has been reported by others such as in the Zhang et al. paper? Is there any impact on the migration of the knock-down cells? Could either of these potential phenotypes, if present, account for or contribute to the reduced levels of fusion?</p><p>5.

Just as examples, can Myo10 contribute to fusion via its involvement in cell adhesion? Through its FERM domain, Myo10 interacts with N-cadherin (Lai et al., 2015, Front Cell Neurosci. 9: 326), a protein implicated in myoblast fusion (Knudsen et al., 1990, Experim. Cell Res, 188, 175-184). FERM domain is also responsible for Myo10 interactions with β-integrin at filopodia tips (Alieva et al., 2019, Nature Commun. 10, Article number: 3593). Β-integrins have been also implicated into myoblast fusion (Schwander et al., 2003 Dev Cell 4(5):673-85). Will filopodia induced by truncated Myo10 lacking FERM domain support fusion?</p><p>Are Myo10 and Myo10-filopedia required by both fusing cells, or by only one of the cells?</p><p>Can Myo10-generated filopodia promote fusion by concentrating fusogenic proteins? It would be interesting to compare the amounts of Myomaker and Myomerger associated with Myo10-generated filopodia vs. those at the plasma membrane along the cell body and at lamellipodial extensions formed by the cells lacking Myo10? Can Myo10 deficiency be rescued by overexpressing &quot;fusogenic&quot; proteins?</p><p>Again, these are just examples of questions that may deepen understanding of the role of Myo10 in myoblast fusion.</p><p>2) In Figure 1, the authors compare undifferentiated (and mononucleated) C2C12 cells and multinucleated myotubes. Since multinucleated cells are obviously quite different from mononucleated cells, it would be interesting and perhaps more informative, to compare undifferentiated C2C12 cells with yet mononucleated differentiated C2C12 cells.</p><p>3) Figure 1F shows myoblast utilizing a lamellipodial extension with protrusions to fuse with an adjacent cell. How many fusion events are caught early enough to resolve cell-cell bridging projections and is there any correlation between location and morphology of the projections (dorsal vs. lamellipodial extensions) and the probability of their association with fusion site?</p><p>4) Figure S4. According to Millay et al., 2013, myomaker gene in C2C12 cells just starts to be expressed after 1 day of differentiation. Do you expect it to already be well expressed at the surface of C2C12 cells? The specificity of immunostaining with Myomaker antibodies in your experiments should be verified by controls with myomaker-deficient myoblasts or, at least, with proliferating C2C12 cells.</p><p>5) Figure 5B. The legend describes the images as: &quot;Myomaker and Myomixer puncta are found localized to Myo10-filled filopodia of differentiating myoblasts.&quot; While the images show that Myomaker and Myomixer are present in filopodia, I see no indication in these images that Myomaker and Myomixer are enriched in the filopodia. It is difficult to say without analysis but filopodia seem to show less staining for these proteins than the body of the cell.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Filopodia powered by class X myosin promote fusion of mammalian myoblasts&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Actin-rich filopodia-like protrusions participate in myoblast fusion, and at least in <italic>Drosophila</italic> filopodial proteins Enabled and IRSp53 are critical for myoblast-myotube fusion. However, the precise molecular composition of filopodia that contribute to myoblast fusion, especially in vertebrates, is incompletely understood. Here, Hammers et al. provide evidence that class X myosin (Myo10) is an important component of myoblast fusion in mammals. They show that expression of Myo10 is upregulated during myoblast differentiation and muscle regeneration, and that Myo10 drives the formation of filopodia in myoblasts. Importantly, they demonstrate that deletion of Myo10 leads to defects in myoblast fusion in vitro and for muscle regeneration in vivo. This manuscript provides important new information on the mechanisms of myoblast fusion. However, there are few points that should be addressed to strengthen the study.</p><p>The images on the localization of Myomaker and Myomixer along filopodia in differentiating muscle cells are not convincing. For example, from Figure 5B it appears that Myomixer does not localize to filopodia and also Myomaker vesicles display only very occasional localization to filopodia. Thus, the authors should repeat these experiments to obtain better quality images, or tone down their conclusions about localization of myogenic fusion proteins to filopodia.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for noting this concern. We agree that there is a challenge in interpreting whether these highly-expressed proteins are being actively associated with filopodia or freely diffusible across the membrane that encloses a filopodium. In the current manuscript, we address this issue by investigating where these proteins localize in the insoluble, actin-associated cellular fraction of differentiated myotubes. As you will see in Figure 5 panels C and D, both Myomixer and Myomaker puncta can be found co-localizing with Myo10 on actin bundles representing the remnants of myotube filopodia. While we have also demonstrated the specificity of the commercially-available Myomaker and Myomixer antibodies used for this assessment using undifferentiated myoblasts transfected with plasmids encoding each of the proteins (Figure S7A-B), this experiment was also repeated using Flag-tagged versions of Myomaker and Myomixer, that have been previously demonstrated to retain protein viability, in case there are remaining concerns about the specificity of the antibodies used. As shown in Figure S8, these Flag-tagged Myomaker and Myomixer constructs demonstrate similar localization patterns as the native protein immunofluorescence in both complete cells and the insoluble cellular fraction. We have, therefore, interpreted these data to confirm that Myomaker and Myomixer are associated with the cytoskeletal aspects of muscle filopodia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Filopodia have been strongly implicated in mediating cell-cell fusion during muscle development in both flies and zebrafish. The exact role of these cellular protrusions in muscle development remains unknown. Hammers et al. implicate filopodia generated by the unconventional myosin Myo10 as key mediators of myoblast fusion during muscle development and suggest that they are important for delivering the muscle fusogens Myomaker and Myomixer to target cells. Most interestingly, the work also strongly implicates filopodia in having a major role during muscle regeneration following injury.</p><p>The authors take good advantage of both the mouse C2C12 line and a conditional Myo10 KO mouse to highlight the importance of filopodia in muscle. The results clearly and convincingly show that Myo10-dependent filopodia play a critical role in myoblast fusion during muscle differentiation in vitro and also strongly implicate them in fusion in vivo, providing a new perspective on the mechanism of muscle development and regeneration.

Likely, the incredibly dense cellular content of developing embryonic muscle is able to compensate for loss of Myo10/filopodia during embryonic development, as adequate cell-to-cell contact is likely met to induce myoblast fusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>1) The authors may consider addressing some of the questions related to the mechanistic role of Myo10 and Myo10 filopodia in fusion.

In response, we have performed two key experiments that provide more insight into the involvement of Myo10 in muscle cell fusion.</p><p>First, we have investigated the requirement of Myo10 cargo binding for the promotion of myoblast fusion using a Myo10 construct lacking much of the C-terminal tail, including the PEST, PH, MyTH4, and FERM domains (referred to as Myo10ΔCBD). As shown in Figure S3A, cells expressing this construct do form filopodia, as the Myo10 motor domain and anti-parallel coiled-coil are not affected. Expression of this truncated Myo10, however, does not rescue myoblast fusion, as is seen using the full-length Myo10 construct. These data are currently found in Figure S3B.</p><p>Secondly, we have sought to determine whether Myo10 is required by one of the fusing cells or both fusing cells to promote multinucleated muscle formation. As shown in Figure S4A, we distinctly labeled control and Myo10 KD cells with fluorescent proteins and performed a co-culture experiment to determine if chimeric myotubes are formed. To our surprise, evidence of fusion between control and Myo10 KD myoblasts is exceedingly rare (only 1 instance found; see Figure S4B). These data (found in Figure S4C) suggest that is it highly favorable for Myo10 to be present on both cells of a muscle fusion event.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 1, the authors compare undifferentiated (and mononucleated) C2C12 cells and multinucleated myotubes. Since multinucleated cells are obviously quite different from mononucleated cells, it would be interesting and perhaps more informative, to compare undifferentiated C2C12 cells with yet mononucleated differentiated C2C12 cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Once myoblasts undergo differentiation, begin expressing Myo10, and exhibit cellular elongation into a myotube (as shown in Video S11), the cellular projection are very similar independently of whether the myotube has one or several nuclei. Notable differences in cellular projection numbers and sizes are only found between undifferentiated and differentiated cells within the conditions studied in this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1F shows myoblast utilizing a lamellipodial extension with protrusions to fuse with an adjacent cell. How many fusion events are caught early enough to resolve cell-cell bridging projections and is there any correlation between location and morphology of the projections (dorsal vs. lamellipodial extensions) and the probability of their association with fusion site?</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, visualizing active cell fusion events in fluorescence-based live cell experiments is a low-probability occurrence that is sensitive to the frequency of image acquisition, even in low laser-power conditions. Therefore, catching the precise structures leading to cellular fusion is incredibly difficult. In the current submission, we have included a new sequence into Figure 1F and Video S8 that depicts a cellular fusion event initiated by a myotube lateral edge that clearly exhibits several filopodia that engage with the target cell prior to fusion. From the limited visual information we have on the phenomenon, it appears the probability of fusion is equal from lateral edges, dorsal/belly surfaces, and lamellipodial extension of myotubes, and really depends on where the fusion target cell is located in relation to the fusion-initiating myotube.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure S4. According to Millay et al., 2013, myomaker gene in C2C12 cells just starts to be expressed after 1 day of differentiation. Do you expect it to already be well expressed at the surface of C2C12 cells? The specificity of immunostaining with Myomaker antibodies in your experiments should be verified by controls with myomaker-deficient myoblasts or, at least, with proliferating C2C12 cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We suspect Myomaker can be externalized to the plasma membrane (presumably from Golgi-derived vesicles, as demonstrated by Gamage et al.) soon after expression begins, as Myomixer is confirmed to be externalized early in differentiation, using antibodies with C-terminal epitopes (Figures S7-8).</p><p>In response to your concern, we have included our antibody testing images using undifferentiated myoblasts transfected with either Myomaker or Myomixer. These data suggest that the antibodies have specificity within the concentration/signal range used for this study. To further confirm that our observations obtained with Myomaker and Myomixer antibodies are not artifacts of non-specfic antibodies, the studies were repeated using Flag-tagged versions of the proteins that have been previously reported to retain protein function (Figure S8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 5B.

As is now included in Figure 5C-D, native Myomixer and Myomaker can be found co-localizing with Myo10 on actin bundles. The Flag-tagged version of the two proteins show the same localization pattern, as well (Figure S8B-C). We believe these data provide evidence that there is an association between muscle filopodia and these fusion proteins.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors have satisfactorily responded to the comments raised in the initial review and the now include data showing that a cargo binding mutant of Myo10 cannot support fusion strengthens the work.

We decided the most appropriate definition of filopodia is an actively elongating thin cellular projection that is dependent on Myo10. Based on this strict definition, we could not confirm that these structures were indeed filopodia until the Myo10 loss of function experiment was conducted (Lines 189-191). Accordingly, we refer to the entire population of these structures as projections/protrusions and verified Myo10-driven structures as filopodia throughout the manuscript to emphasize this distinction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The time of differentiation is not always clearly stated in the text or indicated on figures or in the legend (e.g. Figure 3, S2, S3, S4; Figure 5B).

Moreover, finding that like myomaker expression, Myo10 (and, by extension, the ability to form filopodia) is required bilaterally for myoblast fusion suggests that myomaker function depends on filopodium formation. The authors may want to emphasize these intriguing findings and comment on them in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this helpful discussion. At your suggestion, we have added a new sentence (lines 396-399) to the Discussion section pointing out the possibility that Myomaker’s function may depend on Myo10’s role filopodia formation and cargo binding ability.</p></body></sub-article></article>
