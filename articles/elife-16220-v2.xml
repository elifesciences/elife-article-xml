Using complementary genomics analyses, we identified the interferon pathway as the major signaling cascade consistently activated by trisomy 21 in human cells. Transcriptome analysis revealed that trisomy 21 activates the interferon transcriptional response in fibroblast and lymphoblastoid cell lines, as well as circulating monocytes and T cells. Trisomy 21 cells show increased induction of interferon-stimulated genes and decreased expression of ribosomal proteins and translation factors. An shRNA screen determined that the interferon-activated kinases JAK1 and TYK2 suppress proliferation of trisomy 21 fibroblasts, and this defect is rescued by pharmacological JAK inhibition. Therefore, we propose that interferon activation, likely via increased gene dosage of the four interferon receptors encoded on chromosome 21, contributes to many of the clinical impacts of trisomy 21, and that interferon antagonists could have therapeutic benefits.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16220.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16220.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16220.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our genetic information is contained within structures called chromosomes. Down syndrome is caused by the genetic condition known as trisomy 21, in which a person is born with an extra copy of chromosome 21. This extra chromosome affects human development in many ways, including causing neurological problems and stunted growth. Trisomy 21 makes individuals more susceptible to certain diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease and autoimmune disorders – where the immune system attacks healthy cells in the body – while protecting them from tumors and some other conditions.</p><p>Since cells with trisomy 21 have an extra copy of every single gene on chromosome 21, it is expected that these genes should be more highly expressed – that is, the products of these genes should be present at higher levels inside cells. However, it was not clear which genes on other chromosomes are also affected by trisomy 21. Sullivan et al. aimed to identify which genes are affected by trisomy 21 by studying samples collected from a variety of individuals with, and without, this condition.</p><p>Four genes in chromosome 21 encode proteins that recognize signal molecules called interferons, which are produced by cells in response to viral or bacterial infection. Interferons act on neighboring cells to regulate genes that prevent the spread of the infection, shut down the production of proteins and activate the immune system. Sullivan et al. show that cells with trisomy 21 produce high levels of genes that are activated by interferons and lower levels of genes required for protein production. In other words, the cells of people with Down syndrome are constantly fighting a viral infection that does not exist.</p><p>Constant activation of interferon signaling could explain many aspects of Down syndrome, including neurological problems and protection against tumors. The next steps are to fully define the role of interferon signaling in the development of Down syndrome, and to find out whether drugs that block the action of interferons could have therapeutic benefits.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16220.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16220.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>down syndrome</kwd><kwd>trisomy 21</kwd><kwd>interferon</kwd><kwd>JAK inhibitors</kwd><kwd>ruxolitinib</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010174</institution-id><institution>University of Colorado</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Linda Crnic Institute for Down Syndrome</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Espinosa</surname><given-names>Joaquín M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Espinosa</surname><given-names>Joaquín M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA117907</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Espinosa</surname><given-names>Joaquín M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1243522</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Espinosa</surname><given-names>Joaquín M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Anna and John J.

The extra copy of chromosome 21 (chr21) impacts human development in diverse ways across every major organ system, causing the condition known as Down syndrome (DS). One of the most intriguing aspects of T21 is that it causes an altered disease spectrum in the population with DS, protecting these individuals from some diseases (e.g. solid tumors, hypertension), while strongly predisposing them to others (e.g. Alzheimer’s disease, leukemia, autoimmune disorders) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sobey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bratman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roberts and Izraeli, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anwar et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Malinge et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hasle et al., 2016</xref>). Despite many years of study, the molecular, cellular, and physiological mechanisms driving both the protective and deleterious effects of T21 are poorly understood. A few chr21-encoded genes have been implicated in the development of specific comorbidities, such as <italic>APP</italic> in Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wiseman et al., 2015</xref>), and <italic>DYRK1A</italic> and <italic>ERG</italic> in hematopoietic malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stankiewicz and Crispino, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Malinge et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, research in this area could inform a wide range of medical conditions affecting not only those with DS, but also the typical population.</p><p>The clinical manifestation of DS is highly variable among affected individuals, with various comorbidities appearing in a seemingly random fashion, suggesting the presence of strong modifiers, genetic or otherwise, of the deleterious effects of T21. Even conserved features, such as cognitive impairment, display wide quantitative variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Sola et al., 2015</xref>). Collectively, our understanding of the mechanisms driving such inter-individual variation in the population with DS is minimal. More specifically, it is unclear what gene expression changes are consistently caused by T21, versus those that are context-dependent. Integrated analyses of a large body of studies have indicated that the changes in gene expression caused by T21 involve various signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Scarpato et al., 2014</xref>), however, these studies vary widely in cell type, number of samples, and even analysis platform, among other variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Volk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Costa et al., 2011</xref>). More recently, gene expression analysis of cells derived from discordant monozygotic twins, only one of which was affected by T21, concluded that global gene expression changes in T21 cells are driven by differences in chromatin topology, whereby affected genes are clustered into large chromosomal domains of activation or repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Letourneau et al., 2014</xref>). However, independent re-analysis of these data has challenged this conclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Do et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, there remains a clear need to identify the consistent gene expression changes caused by T21 and to characterize how these programs are modified across cell types, tissue types, genetic backgrounds, and developmental stages.</p><p>In order to identify <italic>consistent</italic> signaling pathways modulated by T21, defined as those that withstand the effects of inter-individual variation, we employed two complementary genomics approaches, transcriptome analysis and shRNA loss-of-function screening, in both panels of cell lines and primary cell types from individuals of diverse genetic background, gender, and age, with and without T21. Our RNA-seq transcriptome analysis identified <italic>consistent</italic> gene expression signatures associated with T21 in all cell types examined. Interestingly, the fraction of this gene expression signature that is not encoded on chr21 is dominated by the interferon (IFN) transcriptional response, an observation that is reproducible in skin fibroblasts, B cell-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines, as well as primary monocytes and T cells. In parallel, we performed a kinome-focused shRNA screen that identified the IFN-activated kinases JAK1 and TYK2 as strong negative regulators of T21 cell proliferation in fibroblasts. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of JAK kinases improves T21 cell viability. Taken together, our results identify the IFN pathway as <italic>consistently</italic> activated by T21, which could merely be a result of increased gene dosage of four IFN receptor subunits encoded on chr21. We hypothesize that IFN activation could contribute to many of the effects of T21, including increased risk of leukemia and autoimmune disorders, as well as many developmental abnormalities also observed in interferonopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zitvogel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crow and Manel, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McGlasson et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Trisomy 21 causes consistent genome-wide changes in gene expression</title><p>In order to investigate <italic>consistent</italic> gene expression signatures associated with T21, we performed RNA-seq on a panel of 12 age- and gender-matched human fibroblasts from euploid (disomic, D21) and T21 individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). T21 was confirmed by PCR analysis of the chr21-encoded <italic>RCAN1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We included samples from different genetic backgrounds, ages, and genders, in order to avoid identifying differences that are specific to a particular pair of isogenic or genetically related cell lines and which would not withstand the effects of inter-individual variation. To illustrate this point, comparison of one pair of disomic male individuals of similar age yielded thousands of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), with similar numbers of upregulated and downregulated DEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>, Male 1 vs. Male 2). However, when the 12 samples are divided into two groups with roughly balanced age, sex, and T21 status, very few consistent changes were identified, thus demonstrating the impact of inter-individual variation within our sample set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>, Group 1 vs. Group 2). In contrast, comparison of all T21 versus all D21 cells identified 662 consistent DEGs, with a disproportionate number of these upregulated in T21 cells (471 of 662, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, T21 vs. D21, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). We also observed an uncharacteristic spike of DEGs at ~1.5-fold overexpression in T21 cells on a volcano plot, consistent with many chr21 genes being overexpressed solely due to increased gene dosage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). For comparison purposes, we also analyzed samples by sex which expectedly yielded DEGs encoded on chrX (e.g. <italic>XIST</italic>) and chrY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 A–B</xref>; Female vs. Male). Sex causes fewer significant changes than T21, with roughly equal numbers of upregulated and downregulated genes. Taken together, these data indicate that T21 produces consistent changes in a gene expression signature that withstands differences in genetic background, age, sex, and site of biopsy. Of note, when we performed RNA-seq analysis using increasing numbers of T21 vs. D21 pairs, the fraction of chr21-encoded DEGs increased steadily with sample size, accounting for ~12% of the core gene expression signature in the 12 cell line panel. However, 88% of DEGs are located on other chromosomes, indicating the existence of conserved mechanisms driving these genome-wide changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16220.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Transcriptome analysis identifies consistent changes in global gene expression between euploid (D21) and trisomy 21 (T21) fibroblasts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MA plots displaying the results of RNA-seq analysis for the indicated comparisons (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).

Thus, we next asked where the ~88% of core DEGs not encoded on chr21 are located across the genome. This exercise revealed broad distribution across all chromosomes, with no obvious contiguous domains of up- or downregulation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref> for a whole genome Manhattan plot, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> for individual chromosomes). In fact, mere visual analysis of DEGs from the individual chromosomes previously claimed by Letourneau et al. to harbor large dysregulated domains (e.g. chr3, chr11, chr19) did not reveal such domains in our dataset, showing instead obvious regions of overlapping activation and repression (shaded gray boxes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, our analysis is more consistent with the report that re-analyzed the data in Letournaeu et al. and questioned the existence of these chromosomal domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Do et al., 2015</xref>). In fact, the only region of the genome at which there was clear contiguous upregulation of DEGs was chr21 itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>).</p><p>In order to characterize the mechanism driving the consistent changes caused by T21, we examined the regulatory differences between DEGs encoded on chr21 and those not encoded on chr21. Several lines of evidence indicate that, while chr21 DEGs are regulated mostly by increased gene dosage, non-chr21 DEGs may be driven by specific pathways that are subject to signal amplification, with a bias toward upregulation, and greatly affected by inter-individual variation. First, violin plots display the relatively small number of chr21 DEGs, showing mostly upregulation clustered around 1.5 fold, versus a much larger number of non-chr21 DEGs, showing both up- and downregulation with no obvious clustering of fold changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Second, the obvious effect of gene dosage on the expression of chr21 DEGs is apparent in the violin plots and heatmaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>), where the median fold change centers around 1.5 fold (e.g. <italic>APP, ETS2</italic>), while a few genes show greater induction (e.g. <italic>MX1, MX2</italic>). In fact, chr21 genes exhibit more than an 80% probability of a ~1.5-fold change as calculated by kernel density estimation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Third, the bias toward upregulation among non-chr21 DEGs is evident in the violin plots, heatmaps, and density estimation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>), where a larger fraction of these genes is upregulated. Finally, we measured the inter-individual variation of chr21 DEGs versus non-chr21 DEGs by calculating the standard deviation for each DEG across each age- and gender-matched pair of fibroblasts. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, the median standard deviation for chr21 DEGs is much smaller than for all DEGs.</p><p>Altogether, these results suggest the existence of consistent signaling pathways activated by increased dosage of chr21 genes, which in turn cause global changes in gene expression, with a bias toward upregulation and displaying strong inter-individual variation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Trisomy 21 leads to constitutive activation of the interferon transcriptional response</title><p>Next, we subjected T21 DEGs to upstream regulator analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to identify putative factors contributing to consistent changes in gene expression. This analysis tool includes both a hypergeometric test for overlapping sets of genes and a directional component to predict activation or inactivation of factors that control gene expression (e.g. transcription factors, protein kinases) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krämer et al., 2014</xref>). We confirmed the effectiveness of this tool using published RNA expression datasets from our lab for cells treated with an inhibitor of the p53-MDM2 interaction, hypoxia, and serum stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sullivan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Donner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galbraith et al., 2013</xref>). IPA effectively identified p53, the Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1A (HIF1A), and growth factor receptors and downstream kinases (PDGF, ERK) as the top upstream regulators in each scenario, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Strikingly, the top 13 upstream regulators predicted to be activated in T21 cells are all IFN-related factors, including IFN ligands (e.g. IFNA2, IFNB, IFNG) and IFN-activated transcription factors (e.g. IRF3, IRF5, IRF7, STAT1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Importantly, most of these signals are derived from non-chr21 DEGs, and would be missed by analyses focused specifically on chr21-encoded genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This analysis also identified two known repressors of IFN signaling, MAPK1 and TRIM24, as upstream regulators inactivated in T21 cells, consistent with activation of the IFN pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tisserand et al., 2011</xref>).

Using a combination of IPA upstream regulator predictions and our RNA-seq data, we clearly identified the canonical IFN pathways –from ligands through receptors and kinases and down to transcription factors and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs)– as activated in T21 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Whereas IFN receptors are upregulated ~1.5 fold with relatively low levels of inter-individual variation, as expected for increased gene dosage in T21 cells, the downstream ISGs exhibit larger fold changes, greater variation between samples, and tend to have low expression levels in D21 cells, in accord with activation of IFN only in T21 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We confirmed the elevated basal expression of three of the IFN receptors (IFNAR1, IFNGR2, and ILR10RB), enhanced basal phosphorylation of STAT1, as well as increased basal expression of several ISGs at the protein level in T21 cells, with noticeable inter-individual variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shuai et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Waddell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schoggins et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>We next analyzed protein lysates from the 12 fibroblast lines using SOMAScan technology, which employs DNA aptamers to monitor epitope abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gold et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mehan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hathout et al., 2015</xref>). This assay confirmed elevated protein levels for many of the IFN-related genes found to be induced at the mRNA level in the RNA-seq experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Finally, we examined the fraction of our upregulated DEGs linked to IFN signaling using IPA, Pathway Commons, and a list of 387 validated ISGs curated by Schoggins and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schoggins et al., 2011</xref>). Our analysis revealed that 21% (101/471) of DEGs upregulated in T21 cells are linked to IFN signaling, with contributions from both chr21 (17%, 14/81) and non-chr21 (22%, 87/390) DEGs, pointing to IFN activation as a potential mechanism for the larger number of upregulated versus downregulated DEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Altogether, these results indicate that the IFN pathway is consistently induced by trisomy 21 in fibroblasts, and that the IFN transcriptional response accounts for a considerable fraction of the transcriptome changes caused by trisomy 21 across the genome.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Trisomy 21 cells display stronger induction of ISGs upon stimulation with IFN ligands than euploid cells</title><p>We next investigated whether T21 cells produce a stronger response to specific IFN ligands than their D21 counterparts. To test this, we treated three pairs of fibroblasts –roughly matched by age and sex– with various doses of the Type I ligands IFN-α or -β, or with the Type II ligand IFN-γ, and monitored the expression of key ISGs via western blot. We also monitored phosphorylation of STAT1. Overall, these efforts revealed that trisomy 21 cells show stronger induction of ISGs upon treatment with all three ligands, albeit with variation across specific cell lines and ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). For example, stimulation with IFN-α led to stronger induction in the T21 cell line for MX1 in pairs 1 and 2, stronger induction of IDO1 in pairs 1 and 3, and stronger induction of ISG15 in pairs 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Similar results were observed for the other Type I ligand, IFN-β. However, ligand-specific differences were also observed. For example, IDO1 was more strongly induced by IFN-α and -β in the T21 cell line in pair 1, but this was not the case when using IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). Thus, these results confirm the notion of strong inter-individual variation in the downstream signaling effects of T21. Of note, all three IFN ligands consistently induced STAT1 phosphorylation (pSTAT1) both in D21 and T21 cells, but the levels of pSTAT1 did not correlate precisely with the expression levels of the various ISGs. For example, the obviously different levels of ISG15 in pair 2 upon treatment with the three ligands do not correlate with dissimilar levels of pSTAT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). This suggests that STAT1 phosphorylation is not a robust predictor of ISG expression, which is ultimately defined by the orchestrated action of multiple IFN-activated transcription factors.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16220.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>T21 fibroblasts are more sensitive to IFN stimulation than D21 fibroblasts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blots showing that three T21 cell lines are more sensitive to IFN-α treatment (24 hr) than age- and gender-matched D21 control cells as measured by induced expression of the ISGs MX1, IDO1 and ISG15.

We hypothesized that core gene expression changes in T21 cells lead to a rewiring of signaling cascades, creating differential requirements for specific kinases during cell survival and proliferation. In order to identify such kinases, we introduced a library of 3,075 shRNAs targeting 654 kinases into each of the 12 fibroblast cell lines we subjected to transcriptome analysis. We then propagated these cells for 14 days to allow for selection of cells harboring shRNAs targeting kinases that differentially affect survival and/or proliferation of T21 cells versus D21 cells, henceforth referred to as DM<sup>T21</sup> kinases (Differential Modulators of T21 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In this screen, relative enrichment of a given shRNA in the T21 population could result from the targeted kinase being a negative regulator of T21 cellular fitness, a positive regulator of D21 cellular fitness, or a combination of both. To minimize the possibility of shRNA off-target effects, we required at least three independent shRNAs targeting a given kinase to score as significantly enriched or depleted, with no more than one shRNA against each kinase scoring in the opposite direction (see Materials and methods for details). This analysis identified a total of 25 and 15 kinases that negatively and positively affect the fitness of T21 cells relative to D21 cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The top scoring enriched kinase was mTOR, indicating that this kinase differentially decreases the fitness of T21 cells (and/or differentially increases the fitness of D21 cells). This could be consistent with previous reports showing hyperactivation of mTOR signaling in the brains of individuals with DS and mouse models of trisomy 21 and consequent impairments in autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Perluigi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Troca-Marín et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Iyer et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, among DM<sup>T21</sup> kinases predicted to hinder T21 cell viability were the IFN-activated kinases JAK1 and TYK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Müller et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stahl et al., 1994</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). To confirm that JAK1 signaling negatively affects the relative viability of T21 cells, we treated two pairs of D21/T21 fibroblasts with increasing doses of the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib (Rux) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tefferi et al., 2011</xref>). Rux treatment led to decreased levels of pSTAT1, decreased protein expression of MX1 –an ISG encoded on chr21–, and decreased mRNA expression of several ISGs found to be upregulated in T21 fibroblasts in our RNA-seq experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). To assess the impact of Rux treatment on cell viability, we seeded equal numbers of D21 and T21 fibroblasts in the absence or presence of increasing doses of the inhibitor, and counted the number of viable cells 3 days post-seeding. Notably, the number of viable T21 cells was much lower in all conditions tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). However, whereas Rux treatment led to a dose-dependent increase in the number of viable T21 cells, it also produced a decrease in the number of viable D21 cells at the highest concentration. When the cell counts are represented as T21/D21 ratios, it is clear that JAK inhibition has a differential effect on cell proliferation between T21 and D21 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>). This is consistent with shRNAs targeting JAK1 (and TYK2) being differentially enriched in T21 cells during the 14-day course of the screen. Ultimately, these data support the notion of differential signaling requirements in T21 relative to D21 cells and identify two IFN-related kinases as negative regulators of T21 fibroblast viability.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16220.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>An shRNA screen identifies the interferon (IFN)-activated kinases JAK1 and TYK2 as negative regulators of trisomy 21 (T21) cellular fitness.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of kinome-focused shRNA screen to identify Differential Modulators of T21 (DM<sup>T21</sup>) cellular fitness.

These cell lines were generated by immortalizing B cells with Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), thus enabling us to compare a cell type of lymphocytic origin with the fibroblasts of mesenchymal origin. Analysis of DEGs associated with T21 identified 1538 genes both up and downregulated with more upregulated DEGs (861 out of 1538), as was seen in the fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). Similarly, a peak of highly significant DEGs with ~1.5-fold change, comprised of chr21-encoded genes, is observed in a volcano plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Furthermore, most DEGs are distributed across the genome, and not arranged into obvious chromosomal domains outside of chr21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

However, a unique feature of the primary cell types -monocytes and T cells- is a predicted inactivation of the gene expression program driven by the transcription factor MYCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Comparison of the canonical pathways deregulated in all four cell types confirms that IFN signaling is the top activated pathway, but also reveals that monocytes and T cells, and to a lesser degree lymphoblastoids, show strong repression of the EIF2 pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

On the other hand, the MYC family of transcription factors are known drivers of ribosome biogenesis, protein synthesis and cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">van Riggelen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boon et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arabi et al., 2005</xref>). Similarly, the EIF2 pathway is a key driver of protein translation, with eIF2 itself being an essential translation initiation factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hinnebusch, 2014</xref>). Analysis of the gene signatures identified by IPA that predicted inactivation of both the MYCN transcriptional program and the EIF2 pathway showed a substantial degree of overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1E</xref>). In monocytes and T cells, the genes common between the two repressed programs encode components of both the small and large ribosome subunits (i.e. RPS proteins in the 40S complex and RPL proteins in the 60S complex) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">2</xref>). Genes exclusive to the MYCN signature are enriched for metabolic enzymes and translation elongation factors (EEFs). Genes exclusive to the EIF2 signature are enriched for translation initiation factors (EIFs) and additional ribosomal proteins.

A principal component analysis (PCA) shows the fibroblast transcriptomes segregating strongly (PC1 80.5%) from those of the cell types of hematopoietic origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). B cell-derived lymphoblastoids and T lymphocytes cluster together, yet they segregate away from the monocytes of myeloid origin (PC2, 11.3%). Within this background, the global impact of the trisomy on the transcriptome is secondary to the effects of the cell type of origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Next, we asked to what degree genes encoded on chr21 could be affected by these cell type-specific regulatory landscapes. Indeed, it was easy to identify many chr21 genes displaying obvious differences in relative expression among cell types. For example, <italic>APP</italic> is relatively more highly expressed in fibroblasts, <italic>U2AF1</italic> more highly expressed in lymphoblastoids, <italic>ETS2</italic> more highly expressed in monocytes, and <italic>DYRK1A</italic> more highly expressed in T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1F</xref>). The IFN receptors on chr21 also showed some degree of cell type-specific expression (e.g. <italic>IFNAR2</italic> lowly expressed in fibroblasts, <italic>IFNGR2</italic> lowly expressed in T cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Furthermore, relative differences in cell type-specific expression is also evident for canonical ISGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). These observations led us to ask to what degree the IFN transcriptional response elicited by T21 is conserved across cell types. To address this, we compared the DEGs comprising the T21-induced <italic>Interferon alpha</italic> signature identified by IPA in each cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Remarkably, this exercise revealed a large degree of cell type-specificity, with most IFN-related genes being differentially expressed in only one cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). In fact, the only common genes among all four signatures are three IFN-α-related genes encoded on chr21: <italic>IFNAR1, IFNAR2</italic>, and <italic>MX1</italic>. Expectedly, lymphoblastoids and T cells showed a greater degree of overlap than other pairwise comparisons. Overall, these results indicate that while T21 operates within, and is modulated by, cell type-specific regulatory landscapes, it nonetheless activates the IFN transcriptional response consistently by inducing different gene sets within this program. This is in stark contrast to the notion that T21 affects gene expression either stochastically or through large rearrangements of chromatin domains. In fact, Manhattan plots of the DEGs in monocytes and T cells derived from the same individuals not only confirm the absence of large domains of chromatin deregulation, but also highlight the high degree of cell type-specific changes caused by the trisomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16220.023</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Trisomy 21 activates the IFN gene expression program in a cell type-specific manner.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Principal component analysis (PCA) of all RNA-seq samples from this study colored by cell type.

As discussed below, IFN hyperactivation could explain many of the developmental and clinical impacts of T21. In fact, we posit that Down syndrome can be understood largely as an interferonopathy, and that the variable clinical manifestations of T21 could be explained by inter-individual differences in adaptation to chronic IFN hyperactivity.</p><p>The link between IFN signaling and T21 is not entirely unprecedented. More than 40 years ago, it was found that human T21 fibroblasts, but not those trisomic for chr13 or chr18, have increased sensitivity to IFN exposure and are more resistant to viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tan et al., 1974a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">1974b</xref>). In fact, somatic cell hybrid experiments showed that chr21 is sufficient to confer sensitivity to human IFN in mouse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Slate et al., 1978</xref>). Pioneering work by Maroun and colleagues using an early mouse model of DS carrying an extra copy of chr16 that harbors orthologues of many human chr21 genes, including the four IFN receptors, clearly implicated IFN as a contributor to the deleterious effects of the trisomy. For example, treatment of pregnant female mice with anti-IFN antibodies resulted in the partial rescue of embryonic growth defects and embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maroun, 1995</xref>). Furthermore, partial normalization of gene dosage for the IFN receptor subunits via gene knockout was shown to improve embryonic development and survival of T21 cortical neurons in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maroun et al., 2000</xref>). More recently, a study found global disruption of IFN-related gene networks in the brains of the Ts1Cje mouse model of DS, which also carries triplication of the IFN receptor subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ling et al., 2014</xref>). However, deeper investigations of IFN signaling in human T21 cells and tissues are largely absent from the literature of the past 30 years, with a few exceptions, such as the description of IFN signaling as a contributor to periodontal disease in DS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tanaka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Iwamoto et al., 2009</xref>). Collectively, these reports and the genomics analyses reported here demonstrate that activation of the IFN pathway in T21 cells is a widespread phenomenon that occurs in diverse tissues, and that is relevant to human Down syndrome as well as the various mouse models of DS with triplication of IFN receptors.</p><p>Constitutive activation of IFN signaling could conceivably explain a large number of comorbidities associated with DS, such as the increased risk of transient myeloproliferative disorder, diverse leukemias, several autoimmune disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Richardson et al., 2011</xref>), and perhaps even the lower rate of solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zitvogel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hasle et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, several JAK inhibitors are either approved or being tested in clinical trials for the treatment of several conditions associated with DS –albeit in the typical population–, including myeloproliferative, inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, as well as leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Padron et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spaner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tefferi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Quintás-Cardama et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Keystone et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jabbari et al., 2015</xref>). It should be noted, however, that the dose limiting toxicities of JAK inhibitors, like ruxolitinib, are anemia and thrombocytopenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McKeage, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Plosker, 2015</xref>). Therefore, rigorous clinical investigations will be required to define if there is a therapeutic window in which these drugs would benefit individuals with DS before the appearance of toxicity. Additional research will also be required to elucidate the interplay between hyperactive IFN signaling in DS with other important factors encoded on chr21 (e.g. <italic>DYRK1A, APP</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Malinge et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wiseman et al., 2015</xref>) or elsewhere in the genome, that have been involved in the development of the specific comorbidities. For example, the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway has been implicated in the etiology of structural and cognitive defects in a mouse model of DS, including cerebellar atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Das et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, IFN signaling has been shown to crosstalk with the SHH pathway, and cerebellar atrophy is also a hallmark of Type I Interferonopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moisan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sun et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McGlasson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crow and Manel, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Increased JAK/STAT signaling has been postulated to contribute to some of the neurological features of DS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, it has been reported that therapeutic exposure to interferons can produce diverse types of neurological dysfunction, including depression, cerebral palsy and spastic diplegia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wichers et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grether et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wörle et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barlow et al., 1998</xref>). Furthermore, a large number of neurological conditions have been linked to deregulated IFN signaling, most prominent among them the so called Type I Interferonopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McGlasson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crow and Manel, 2015</xref>). Therefore, we propose that constitutive activation of the IFN pathway in the central nervous system of individuals with DS is responsible for many of the neurological problems caused by the trisomy. In particular, IFN-mediated activation of microglia could lead to neurotoxicity by several mechanisms, including serotonin depletion, generation of reactive oxygen species, and excitatory toxicity, which could potentially be ameliorated with inhibitors of the IDO1 enzyme, a key ISG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wichers and Maes, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wichers et al., 2005</xref>). Although much research remains to be done, it is now possible to envision early intervention strategies to ameliorate the variable ill effects of T21 by using pharmacological inhibitors of the IFN pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and drug treatments</title><p>Six human fibroblast lines from individuals with trisomy 21 (T21) and six approximately age- and sex-matched fibroblast lines from typical individuals (D21) were obtained from the Coriell Cell Repository (Camden, NJ) and immortalized with hTERT as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lindvall et al., 2003</xref>).

Cells were then propagated for 14 days and genomic DNA harvested from all remaining cells using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit with the optional RNAse A treatment step. Genomic DNA was quantified by A<sub>260</sub> using a Take3 micro-volume plate on a Synergy2 Microplate Reader. The quality of the genomic DNA was confirmed via electrophoresis on a 0.5% TAE agarose gel. Screens were performed in three independent biological replicates for each of the 12 fibroblast cell lines.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>shRNA library preparation</title><p>The library preparation strategy uses genomic DNA and two rounds of PCR in order to isolate the shRNA cassette and prepare a single strand of the hairpin for sequencing by means of an XhoI restriction digest in the stem loop region. This is critical as the hairpin secondary structures of shRNAs are not amenable to NGS and the TRC shRNAs do not have a long enough loop to allow PCR amplification of one shRNA arm in a single step. The first step in sequencing library preparation is to calculate how much genomic DNA must be used for PCR1 which isolates and amplifies the shRNA cassettes from genomic DNA using Phusion Polymerase. The oligonucleotides for PCR1 anneal to regions inside of the LTRs that are common to all clones in the library and should, therefore, amplify all shRNA cassettes with equal efficiency. Each reaction mixture for PCR1 consisted of 10 μL 5X Phusion <italic>HF</italic> buffer, 1 μL dNTPs (10 mM each), 2.5 μL pLKO Forward and Reverse primers (10 μM), 1 μL of 2 unit/μl Phusion Polymerase, 500 ng genomic DNA, and dH2O to 50 μL. The cycling conditions were as follows: 1 cycle of 98°C for 5 min, 15 to 25 cycles of 98°C for 30 s, 70°C for 30 s, 72°C for 30 s, and 1 cycle of 72°C for 7 min. 5 μL of each PCR1 were run on a 2% TAE agarose gel in order to visualize the expected band of 497 bp. It should be noted that the optimal PCR1 cycle number must be empirically determined for each library and to limit cycle numbers to minimize the effects of amplification bias. The correct product of PCR1 is 497 bp; however, excessive cycle numbers can result in the appearance of a slower migrating band. This band represents an annealing event between two amplification products with different shRNA sequences. As the majority of the 497 bp amplicon is common to all products, denatured PCR products can anneal to one another when not out-competed by an excess of primer in later cycles. This aberrant product does not correctly anneal within the central shRNA-containing sequence, therefore disrupting the double-stranded XhoI site required for the subsequent restriction digestion. Carefully determining the appropriate number of cycles prevents the appearance of this undesired product. After establishing an optimal cycle number, we performed 12 identical PCR1 reactions in order to amplify sufficient amounts of genomic DNA and pooled them all prior to cleanup with a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>XhoI digest</title><p>1 μg of the resulting DNA was digested with XhoI overnight at 37°C. Digest reactions consisted of 3.5 μL 10X FD buffer, 1 μL of 20,000 units/mL XhoI, 1 μg of DNA and dH2O to 35 μL. Heat inactivation of XhoI is not recommended, as the high temperatures result in reappearance of the spurious annealing products mentioned above, leading to a disruption of the XhoI overhang required for ligation. For the TRC1 and TRC1.5 libraries, there are two XhoI sites within the product of PCR1, resulting in fragments of 271, 43 and 183 bp. In order to purify the desired fragment, the entire digest was run on a 2% TAE agarose gel and purified the 271 bp fragment using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit. Once the band was excised, three volumes of buffer QG were added and the mixture heated at 30°C to dissolve the agarose. Lower melting temperatures are recommended so as not to denature the complementary double-stranded shRNA cassettes, which may not reanneal to their cognate strand. After the agarose was dissolved, one volume of isopropanol was added and protocol resumed following the manufacturer’s instructions including the optional addition of NaOAc.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Ligation of barcoded linkers</title><p>We prepared the barcoded linkers required for ligation by resuspending the lyophilized oligonucleotides in ST buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl) to 200 μM and combining 25 μL of each for a final concentration of 100 μM. The mixture was heated to 94°C for 10 min and gradually cooled to ensure proper annealing. Single-stranded oligonucleotides were removed from annealed oligonucleotides using Illustra MicroSpin G-25 columns. The sense (S1-S4) oligonucleotides are 5’-phosphorylated and the antisense oligonucleotides (AS1-AS4) each contain a single phosphorothioate bond at the 3’ end to stabilize them and are designed to prevent the reformation of a functional XhoI site. The barcodes within these linkers are used for multiplexing and their length ensures they are compatible with the Illumina HiSeq 2000. Shorter barcode sequences may be compatible with other sequencing platforms. The selected barcoded linkers were added to ligation reactions with 100 ng of each purified 271 bp XhoI fragment, 3.5 μL 10X T4 DNA ligase buffer, 4 μL of 1 μM barcoded linker, 1 μL T4 DNA ligase and dH<sub>2</sub>O to 35 μL. Ligations were performed overnight at 16°C. The entire ligation was run on a 2% TAE agarose gel and the resulting 312 bp band purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit in the same manner as previously described.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>PCR2</title><p>The final step in the preparation of the sequencing library is a second PCR with oligonucleotides that contain the Illumina adaptors required for bridge amplification and sequencing. In this PCR, the number of cycles is minimized in order to avoid PCR bias as well as errors that could affect sequencing. The reaction for PCR2 was as follows: 10 μL 5X Phusion HF buffer, 1 μL dNTPs (10 mM each), 2.5 μL Forward adapter primer (10 μM) 2.5 μL, Reverse adapter primer (10 μM), 1 μL Phusion DNA polymerase 10 ng barcoded DNA, and dH<sub>2</sub>O to 50 μL. The cycling program consisted of 1 cycle of 98°C for 2 min, 2 cycles of 98°C for 30 s, 62°C for 30 s, 72°C for 30 s, 7 cycles of 98°C for 30 s, 72°C for 30 s and 1 cycle of 72°C for 3 min. The final 141 bp product was purified on a 2% TAE-agarose gel followed by QIAquick Gel Extraction as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Illumina sequencing</title><p>We assessed the purity of our sequencing library using the Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent-5067-4626) and confirmed the presence of a single 141 bp peak, indicating one PCR product at the appropriate size. We utilized a multiplexing strategy consisting of four different barcodes with each nucleotide represented at each position of the barcode, allowing us to sequence four samples in each lane on a HiSeq 2000 Illumina instrument. To accomplish this, each sample was quantified and mixed together at a final concentration of 10 ng/μL and using Illumina-specific oligonucleotides and qPCR, we determined the cluster formation efficiency (i.e. effective concentration) of our library to be slightly greater than that of a known library. Accordingly, we loaded the flow cell at 5 pM and included a 10% ΦX-174 spike-in, which aids in quality control of cluster formation and sequencing on the Illumina platform. Cluster formation efficiency and the concentration of library to be loaded on the flow cell needs to be determined empirically for each library preparation. These loading conditions yielded cluster densities between 733,000 clusters/mm<sup>2</sup> and 802,000 clusters/mm<sup>2</sup> and between 203 and 222 million reads per lane.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>shRNA screen analysis</title><p>shRNA data were analyzed in a similar fashion to RNA-seq data. Briefly, quality control was performed with FastQC, reads were trimmed to include only shRNA sequences using FASTQ trimmer, and filtered with the FASTQ Quality Filter. Reads were then aligned to a custom reference library of shRNA sequences using TopHat2. Three out of 36 samples were removed based on poor performance in unsupervised hierarchical clustering and/or principal component analysis, but each fibroblast cell line retained at least two biological replicates and nine of 12 retained all three replicates. Count tables were generated using HTSeq and differential expression determined by DESeq2.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>SOMAScan proteomics</title><p>Cell lysates from all 12 fibroblast cell lines were analyzed using SOMAscan v4.0 according to manufacturer’s instructions and as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hathout et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mehan et al., 2014</xref>).

The study raises the interesting possibility of using ruxolitinib to treat DS phenotypes. The paper also convincingly supports the conclusions of Do et al. (2015) that changes in gene expression in cells with trisomy 21 occur throughout the genome and are not confined to specific domains. The paper was viewed enthusiastically by a member of the BRE and two additional referees. The BRE commented, 'These findings have important implications for understanding the basic nature of, and individual variation in, the diverse phenotypes of people with Down's syndrome'. One referee noted, 'Overall the paper is an interesting and significant study that provides important new insights into the differences in gene expression between D21 and T21 cells'. The second referee commented, 'In principle, the findings are tremendously exciting and present a novel view of the pathology associated with trisomy 21.'</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the following important additional points need to be addressed.</p><p>1) Given the potential enormous impact of the findings, it is incumbent upon the authors to verify at least some of their findings on primary cells at the protein level. There are adequate reagents to establish expression of IFN receptors, pSTAT1 and various IFN-regulated genes in primary cells (e.g. lymphocytes, monocytes etc.) in a subset of subjects with trisomy 21 versus controls. Minimally, this should be done with the fibroblast and lymphoblastoid cell lines including appropriate controls, with and without addition of exogenous IFN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> for instance lacks normal controls). If possible, the relevance of these findings would be greatly advanced by any evidence for enhanced activation of interferon signaling in primary blood cells or serum/plasma of individuals with Down syndrome compared to control individuals. Alternatively, the authors might consider using the Ts65Dn murine model of trisomy 21. It should be simple to analyze pSTAT1 and gene expression in leukocytes from these mice compared to controls. Clearer documentation of the dysregulation of IFNR expression and consequences in primary cells would help the authors' argument and strengthen the very provocative and exciting conclusions.</p><p>2) The nature of the screen is a bit confusing as written. It is difficult to figure out what the actual assay was for the differential requirements of the kinases. This could be better described. Also, a major concern is that there are no data regarding the differences in growth between D21 and T21 cells. Data from proliferation and apoptosis assays should be included. How different are the growth rates? Finally, the text suggests that ruxolitinib promoted the growth of T21 cells, but the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> show viability.

Similar to our initial work using cell lines, we made sure to obtain samples from individuals of both genders, different ages, and different genetic backgrounds. We then processed the blood samples to purify monocytes, T cells, and B cells. We discarded the possibility of simply looking at peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMCs) because there is ample evidence in the literature that individuals with trisomy 21 display changes in the numbers of various blood cell types, which could confound the interpretation of any gene expression changes observed as driven by cell type abundance rather than actual gene regulation. Hence, we opted to analyze more defined cell populations within the hematopoietic system. Due to the limited volume of blood available, we maximized our chances to detect consistent gene expression changes caused by trisomy 21 by performing a combination of assays to analyze both RNA and protein expression. Given the high sensitivity of transcriptome analyses via next-generation sequencing, we decided to analyze monocytes and T cells with RNA-seq. B cell populations were used for Western blot and flow cytometry assays. The RNA-seq experiments were very successful, producing high quality data, and demonstrated unequivocally that IFN signaling is constitutively activated in both monocytes and T cells. As previously observed in fibroblasts and lymphoblasts, the gene expression signature associated with trisomy 21 has clear signs of activation of the interferon transcriptional response. Very interestingly, in addition to the expected upregulation of the IFN receptors and many IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), transcriptome analysis of blood cell types revealed another hallmark of IFN hyperactivation that was not obvious in the analysis of in vitro cell cultures: strong downregulation of the translation machinery. It is well established that a key consequence of the IFN response is to prevent synthesis of viral proteins (Walsh et al. 2013; Gupta et al. 2012; Ivashkiv &amp; Donlin 2014). However, the mechanisms by which IFN signaling affects translation are not well understood. RNA-seq analysis of monocytes and T cells revealed downregulation of dozens of translation initiation and elongation factors, as well as ribosomal proteins in both the small and large ribosome subunits. The importance of this result cannot be overstated, as repression of protein synthesis in tissues from individuals with Down syndrome could contribute to many of the ill effects of trisomy 21. We decided that this important result should occupy a central place in the manuscript, and hence created a new main figure with two supplements to clearly explain these results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">2</xref> in the revised manuscript). Unfortunately, our efforts using western blot for analysis of B cells were not successful, due mostly to the limited amount of protein obtained, but we did manage to measure surface expression of four IFN receptors -three encoded on chr21 (IFNAR1, IFNGR2, IL10RB) and one not encoded on chr21 (IFNGR1)- using flow cytometry for all 17 samples. Expectedly, these experiments revealed a modest but reproducible increase in the expression of the three IFNRs encoded on chr21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). As described below, our western blot efforts produced very clear results when employing cell lines, which could be grown in large amounts.</p><p>Second, in order to verify that increased IFN signaling does not occur only at the transcriptome level, we embarked on a massive effort to analyze changes at the protein level. As suggested by Reviewers, we employed conditions of both basal and stimulated IFN signaling. These efforts resulted in the inclusion of 59 western blot panels analyzing 90 different protein extracts in the revised manuscript. Analysis of basal protein expression in 12 fibroblast cell lines and 6 lymphoblastoid cell lines demonstrated that the IFN receptors are indeed upregulated at the protein level, along with increased levels of phospho-STAT1 and several ISGs, with the expected inter-individual variation observed during the transcriptome analysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> for basal expression in fibroblasts and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> for basal expression in lymphoblastoids). Furthermore, we analyzed protein lysates from the 12 fibroblast cell lines using SOMAscan technology, which employs DNA aptamers to monitor protein abundance (Hathout et al. 2015). This effort confirmed induction of many interferon-related genes at the protein level (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Additionally, we performed a battery of dose-response experiments with three IFN ligands (IFN-α, IFN-β and IFN-γ) on three different pairs of euploid/trisomy 21 fibroblast cell lines. This effort clearly demonstrated that the induced expression of the ISGs tested (MX1, IDO1 and ISG15) is also greater in trisomy 21 cells at the protein level, with signs of inter-individual variation for specific genes, as predicted by the RNA-seq experiments. This comprehensive analysis of protein expression is shown in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p>Third, following Reviewers’ suggestions, we also analyzed primary cells from a mouse model of Down syndrome. We chose to use the Dp16 strain, which carries triplication of only genes found on human chr21. The Ts65DN model proposed by the reviewers has triplication of many genes not on chr21. Of note, the chromosome fragment triplicated in the Dp16 strain contains the four IFN receptors found on human chr21 (Li et al. 2007). RNA-seq analysis of LSK (Lineage negative, Sca1 positive, c-Kit positive) cells confirmed that the IFN receptors are overexpressed in Dp16 mice relative to disomic littermates, as well as several canonical ISGs. These results are now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) The nature of the screen is a bit confusing as written. It is difficult to figure out what the actual assay was for the differential requirements of the kinases. This could be better described. Also, a major concern is that there are no data regarding the differences in growth between D21 and T21 cells. Data from proliferation and apoptosis assays should be included. How different are the growth rates? Finally, the text suggests that ruxolitinib promoted the growth of T21 cells, but the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> show viability. Are there data to support changes in proliferation or is it just survival that is affected by JAK inhibition?</italic> </p><p>We thank these comments from the Reviewers and acknowledge that the shRNA screen results could have been better explained. The revised manuscript addresses this comment in several ways. First, we have expanded the description of the screen and the interpretation of the results in the Results section. Second, we performed additional experiments to investigate in more detail the effects of JAK inhibition. Third, we displayed the results in a more accessible fashion. The revised Figure (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), displays the results of analyzing two pairs of euploid/trisomic fibroblasts during a dose-response of Ruxolitinib. Expectedly, pharmacological JAK inhibition leads to decreased phospho-STAT levels (which is higher in the T21 cell lines) and decreased expression of the IFN-stimulated gene MX1. Strikingly, in the absence of JAK inhibition, there is a significant decrease in the number of trisomy 21 cells in the absence of any treatment. Addition of increasing doses of ruxolitinib enhances the number of viable trisomic cells while decreasing the number of their viable disomic counterparts. Consequently, the relative number of trisomic versus disomic cells increases with the dose of Ruxolitinib. This would explain why, over the course of the two weeks of shRNA screening, shRNAs targeting JAK1 (and TYK2) would show a relative enrichment in trisomy 21 cells.</p><p><italic>3) The increase in IFN gene expression and the sensitivity to ruxolitinib suggests that there is a significant change in JAK/STAT signaling in the T21 cells. Western blots comparing the levels of STAT activation in the T21 versus D21 cells should be included.</italic> </p><p>The requested phospho-STAT1 Western blots are now included at various places throughout the manuscript. Increased levels of basal phospho-STAT1 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, Figure 4—figure supplement 4D, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>. Increased levels of induced phospho-STAT1 in trisomy 21 cells are evident for some fibroblast pairs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Of note, all three IFN ligands consistently induced STAT1 phosphorylation (pSTAT1) both in D21 and T21 cells, but the levels of pSTAT1 did not correlate precisely with the expression levels of the various ISGs. For example, the obviously different levels of ISG15 upon treatment with the three ligands do not correlate with dissimilar levels of pSTAT1 (see cell line pair 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). This suggests that STAT1 phosphorylation is not a robust predictor of ISG expression, which is ultimately defined by the orchestrated action of multiple IFN-activated transcription factors. Finally, we have now included western blots showing dose-dependent repression of pSTAT1 signaling and MX1 expression in response to ruxolitinib treatment for two T21-D21 cell line pairs. We have described these findings in detail in the Results section.</p><p><italic>4) Ruxolitinib was approved for the treatment of myelofibrosis and for some cases of polycythemia vera.
