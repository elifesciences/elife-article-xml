range of challenges, including heightened sensory sensitivities. Here, we examine the idea that sensory overload in ASD may be linked to issues with efference copy mechanisms, which predict the sensory outcomes of self-generated actions, such as eye movements. Efference copies play a vital role in maintaining visual and motor stability. Disrupted efference copies hinder precise predictions, leading to increased reliance on actual feedback and potential distortions in perceptions across eye movements. In our first experiment, we tested how well healthy individuals with varying levels of autistic traits updated their mental map after making eye movements. We found that those with more autistic traits had difficulty using information from their eye movements to update the spatial representation of their mental map, resulting in significant errors in object localization. In the second experiment, we looked at how participants perceived an object displacement after making eye movements. Using a trans-saccadic spatial updating task, we found that those with higher autism scores exhibited a greater bias, indicating under-compensation of eye movements and a failure to maintain spatial stability during saccades. Overall, our study underscores efference copy’s vital role in visuo-motor stability, aligning with Bayesian theories of autism, potentially informing interventions for improved action–perception integration in autism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>perceptual stability</kwd><kwd>visual updating</kwd><kwd>motor updating</kwd><kwd>autism</kwd><kwd>autistic traits</kwd><kwd>efference copy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>757184</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zimmermann</surname><given-names>Eckart</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Marię Sklodowska Curie</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101029574</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pomè</surname><given-names>Antonella</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZI 1456/6-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zimmermann</surname><given-names>Eckart</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Efference copy dysfunctions in heightened autistic traits impair the use of eye movement information for spatial representation and object localization.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) present a complex array of challenges, with sensory sensitivities, a recent addition to diagnostic criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-5, 2013</xref>), standing out as a dominant aspect of this condition. Autistic people often exhibit a general inflexibility in the motor domain and struggle to learn from motor errors, usually linked to restricted and repetitive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lopez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Van Eylen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pomè et al., 2023</xref>). This difficulty in understanding motor errors can hinder their ability to adapt to new sensory information, further exacerbating sensory overload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pomè et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johnson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mosconi et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Recent research has increasingly emphasized the role of predictive abilities in ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sinha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van Boxtel and Lu, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Van de Cruys et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pellicano and Burr, 2012</xref>). In their daily lives within an unpredictable and often chaotic world, humans are consistently engaged in anticipating what might happen next and preparing adaptively for potential threats in their surroundings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-5, 2013</xref>). Within this framework, recent theories propose that individuals with ASD may demonstrate a reduced reliance on prior information when making perceptual judgments. The Bayesian perspective suggests that the predictive system deficits in autism stem from a diminished Bayesian prior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pellicano and Burr, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angeletos Chrysaitis and Seriès, 2023</xref>). From this perspective, the brain unconsciously infers information about the world by applying Bayes’ rule: it assesses the probability of a prediction given sensory data, considering the likelihood of sensory data given that prediction and the Bayesian prior. The Bayesian prior is essentially a probabilistic distribution representing the expectation of the environment being in a particular state before any observations are made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pellicano and Burr, 2012</xref>). These predictive abilities include the role of perceptual priors, which play a crucial role in guiding individuals to make accurate predictions, especially when sensory data is limited. However, in cases of autism, the influence of prior knowledge is believed to be weakened, resulting in predictions that heavily rely on sensory input.</p><p>But how do these priors interact with the sensory and motor systems in autistic people, and how does this influence their perceptual stability? Predicting the consequences of one’s behavior is of vital importance when our movements produce changes on our sensory receptors. When we move our eyes, head, or body, we displace external stimuli on the retina. We must know about this self-produced displacement to avoid confusion with external stimulus motion. In other words, if we would not be able to predict the sensory consequences of our behavior, we would experience that the world is moving. The most frequent movements we perform are voluntary saccades. To rapidly direct the fovea, the area of highest resolution, toward regions of interest, we shift the eyeball with high speed about 3 times per second. Internal predictions about an imminent saccade ensure the smooth and stable continuity of our perception. This anticipation involves a signal incorporating information about the motor vector to predict the sensory consequences of the upcoming saccade. Such a signal is known as an efference copy, that is a copy of the motor command (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wurtz, 2018</xref>). During a tennis game, rapid oculomotor saccades are employed to track the high-velocity ball across the visual display. In the absence of a functional efference copy mechanism, the brain would encounter difficulty in anticipating the precise retinal location of the ball following each saccade. This could result in a transient period of visual disruption as the visual system adjusts to the new eye position. The efference copy, by predicting the forthcoming sensory consequences of the saccade, would bridge this gap and facilitate the maintenance of a continuous and accurate representation of the ball’s trajectory. A key pathway responsible for transmitting efference copy signals involves the superior colliculus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sommer and Wurtz, 2002</xref>), a saccade command area, to the frontal eye field via the medio-dorsal nucleus of the thalamus. Lesions affecting this pathway can impair both motor and visual updating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wurtz, 2018</xref>). We recently reported that in patients with lesions in thalamic nuclei, evidence for two pathways conveying efference copies exists. We found that patients with lesions in the medio-dorsal nucleus showed impairments in visual updating, while those with lesions in both the medio-dorsal and ventrolateral (VL) nuclei exhibited issues with motor updating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellebaum et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bellebaum et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bellebaum et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ostendorf et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ostendorf et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zimmermann et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here, we hypothesized that the impairment of efference copy signals would result in an enduring lack of complete confirmation for pre-saccadic predictions through post-saccadic feedback. A failure in processing efference copy information might have consequences for perception around the execution of saccades. Their reliance on post-saccadic sensory feedback, rather than accurate efference copy predictions, results in a distorted perception of the visual world following eye movements (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic illustration of the proposed model.</title><p>For saccade generation, a motor command is sent to the motor plan which produces the desired eye movement. A correct plan of the movement depends on a comparison between the position of the eye before and after a saccade and therefore on the accuracy of the efference copy signal. If the efference copy is impaired, pre-saccadic prediction will be never completely confirmed by the post-saccadic feedback. This constant lack of successful match between prediction and sensory evidence could influence the accumulation of sensory predictions over time, leading to a less stable perception.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-94946-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>First, intra-saccadic vision might be affected. We never perceive the self-produced motion stimulation on the retina produced by our own saccades. Some theories consider saccadic omission and saccadic suppression as resulting from an active mechanism. In this view, an efference copy would signal the occurrence of a saccade, yielding a transient decrease in visual sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burr et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Binda and Morrone, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zimmermann and Lange, 2022</xref>). Others however have pointed out the possibility that a purely passive mechanism suffices to induce saccadic omission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castet et al., 2002</xref>). A recent study has found evidence for saccadic suppression already in the retina. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Idrees et al., 2020</xref> demonstrated that retinal ganglion cells in isolated retinae of mice and pigs respond to saccade-like displacements, leading to the suppression of responses to additional flashed visual stimuli through visually triggered retinal-circuit mechanisms. Importantly, their findings suggest that perisaccadic modulations of contrast sensitivity may have a purely visual origin, challenging the need for an efference copy in the early stages of saccadic suppression. However, the suppression they measured lasted much longer than time courses observed in behavioral data. An efference copy signal could thus be necessary to release perception from suppression.</p><p>Second, the internal updating of the spatial representation for the saccade vector would be affected. Since intra-saccadic vision is omitted, visual perception is confronted with a retinal image before the saccade and a different one after the performance of the saccade. Predicting the appearance of the post-saccadic image leads to a remapping of internal space and thereby to a seamless perception across the saccade. If the remapping process is not accurate, the appearance of the post-saccadic image would come as a surprise. Surprising stimuli appear much more salient than predicted ones. Failures in trans-saccadic remapping in individuals with autistic symptomatology could be the reason or at least contribute to the sensory overload they experience.</p><p>Third, in addition to problems in visual updating, a lack of proper efference copy transfer should produce problems in motor updating. In cases in which visual information is not available or reliable, the sensorimotor system must rely on internal estimates about its own movements.</p><p>In the laboratory, trans-saccadic updating can be investigated in motor behavior and in perceptual localization. In the double-step paradigm, two consecutive saccades are made to briefly displayed targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Westheimer, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hallett and Lightstone, 1976</xref>). The first saccade occurs without visual references, relying on internal updating to determine the eye’s position. The accuracy of the second saccade quantifies the first saccade’s updating process.</p><p>Perceptual updating is tested similarly, with subjects remembering the position of a target and then indicating it relative to a second target after a single saccade. In this paradigm, one stimulus is shown before and another after saccade execution. Together these two stimuli produce the perception of ‘apparent motion’. If stimuli are placed such that the apparent motion path is orthogonal to the saccade path, then the orientation of the apparent motion path indicates how the saccade vector is integrated into vision. The apparent motion trajectory can only appear vertical if the movement of the eyes is perfectly accounted for, that is the retinotopic displacement is largely compensated, ensuring spatial stability. However, small biases of motion direction – implying under- (or over-) compensation of the eye movement – can indicate relative failures in this stabilization process. In a seminal study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Szinte and Cavanagh, 2012</xref> found a slight over-compensation of the saccade vector leading to apparent motion slightly tilted against the direction of the saccade. More importantly, when efference copies are not available, that is localization occurring at the time of a second saccade in a double-step task, a strong saccade under-compensation occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zimmermann et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>This phenomenon cannot be explained by perisaccadic mislocalization of flashed visual stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fracasso et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Szinte and Cavanagh, 2011</xref>), but the two phenomena may be related in that they may both depend upon efference copy information.</p><p>In the present study, we directly investigated whether the precision of efference copy signals influences the accumulation of sensory predictions over time and explored potential variations in this mechanism among individuals with a heightened autistic trait. The autistic traits of the whole population form a continuum, with ASD diagnosis usually situated on the high end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ruzich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lundström et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Robinson et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, autistic traits share a genetic and biological etiology with ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bralten et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, quantifying autistic-trait-related differences in healthy people can provide unique perspectives as well as a useful surrogate for understanding the symptoms of ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ruzich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sucksmith et al., 2011</xref>). In two experiments, we focused on the role of efference copy in the pathophysiology of autistic traits, particularly in maintaining perceptual continuity during saccades. We hypothesized that individuals with a high autistic phenotype would exhibit decreased accuracy in second saccades during double-step tasks and under-compensation when localizing a stimulus based on efference copy signals. These findings could shed light on the visual stability and predictive challenges faced by autistic people.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Motor updating</title><p>We investigated the influence of autistic traits on visual updating during saccadic eye movements using a classic double-step saccade task. This task relies on participants making two consecutive saccades to briefly presented targets. The accuracy of the second saccade serves as an indirect measure of how effectively the participant’s brain integrated the execution of the first saccade into their internal representation of visual space. Participants were divided into quartiles based on the severity of their autistic traits, as assessed by the autistic quotient (AQ) questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baron-Cohen et al., 2001</xref>). We hypothesized that individuals with higher autistic traits would exhibit greater difficulty in visual updating compared to those with lower autistic traits. This would be reflected in reduced accuracy of their second saccades in the double-step task. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> illustrates examples from participants at the extremes of the autistic trait distribution (AQ = 3, in orange and AQ = 31, in magenta). As shown, both participants were instructed to make saccades to the locations indicated by two brief target appearances (T1 and T2), as quickly and accurately as possible, following the order of presentation. However, successful execution of the second saccade requires accurate internal compensation for the first saccade, without any visual references or feedback available during the saccade itself.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Methods experiment 1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Time course of presentations and spatial arrangement of stimuli during double-step task.

Saccade landing positions of participants in the lower quartile (mean degree ± standard error of the mean [SEM]: 10.17 ± 0.50) did not deviate significantly from those in the upper quartile (mean degree ± SEM: 9.65 ± 0.77).

The analysis of the second saccade provided the means to determine the effect of efference copies signals in underlying extra-retinal information. If the participant fails to compensate for the first saccade due to disrupted efference copy, the second saccade vector deviates from the location of the second target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). A correct remapping of the previously seen target position would lead to smaller angle of deviations from the optimal saccade vector; however, a failure in using efference copy-based updating of visual space would results in larger deviations. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> plots the motor bias (expressed as angle of deviations) as a function of autistic traits severity. We found a significant correlation between the autistic characteristics of our group of participants and the amount of motor bias (<italic>r</italic> = 0.52; p &lt; 0.001; BF10 = 57.37). This result is also confirmed by a strong group difference, between the lower and upper quartile of AQ distribution (<italic>t</italic>(14) = −4.68; p = 0.002; BF10 = 21.45), with a mean bias of 6.26 ± 0.80 for the lower quartile and of 20.61 ± 3.40 for the upper quartile.</p><p>Results on the double-step task suggest that although participants did not show an impairment in the first saccade execution, those with higher autistic traits reported difficulties in using extra-retinal information about the amplitude and direction of the motor vector of the first saccade, in order to update the spatial representation of the second target. Thus, they were less able to use the efference copy of the first saccade to construct a spatial representation of the second target location in generating an accurate saccade toward it.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Visual updating</title><p>With a trans-saccadic localization task, we explored how autistic traits affect the integration of eye movements into visual perception.

We measured the perceived direction of this displacement, which is influenced by how well the participant’s brain accounts for the saccadic eye movement. We predicted that individuals with higher autistic traits would show a stronger bias in the perceived displacement direction, suggesting a less accurate integration of the eye movement into their visual perception.</p><p>Participants were instructed to report the position of a second dot relative to a first dot, after saccade execution (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The two dot stimuli, presented below and above the saccade path, were horizontally displaced from each other to a variable degree. One dot was always presented before saccade onset, the other after saccade completion, so that the saccade dissociates retinal from screen coordinates. To perceive vertical trajectory in screen coordinates, the saccade vector must be compensated for – likely through efference copy information. At saccade completion, on the retina the first probe falls to the right side of the fovea while the second falls to the left side (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, retinal coordinates). To compensate for the effects of the saccade, the visual system corrects the expected location of T2 in the opposite direction to the saccade (black arrow, remapped target position). If this correction is accurate, the displacement of the dots is perceived relatively vertical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, screen coordinates), rather than in retinotopic direction (relatively oblique, gray dashed line) and space constancy is maintained. Every shift from the vertical trajectory indicates an under- or over-compensation of the saccade vector. Previous studies have shown that the dots trajectory is indeed seen as approximately vertical, although a systematic slant of trajectories implies a tendency to over-compensate for the saccade vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Szinte and Cavanagh, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hui et al., 2020</xref>). However, if the retinotopic displacement is uncompensated, a failure in spatial stability is encountered. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> plots two example psychometric functions for one participant at the extremes of the lower (AQ = 3, in orange) and upper quartiles of the distribution (AQ = 31, in magenta). The mean of the psychometric function (PSE) represented the location at which the references and the probe appeared to be vertically aligned. The PSE for the two example participants resulted very different: while ~0° bias represents accurate, spatiotopic correction, a negative bias (PSE &lt;0) reflects an under compensation of the saccade vector.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Methods experiment 2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Spatial arrangement of stimuli and time course of presentations during trans-saccadic localization task.

Specifically, we investigated whether participants exhibited any learning effects throughout the experiments. For data of Experiment 1 – motor updating – we divided our data into 10 separate bins of 30 trials each. We conducted a repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the within-subject factor ‘number of sessions’ (two main sessions of 5 bins each, ~150 trials) and the between-subject factor ‘group’ (lower vs upper quartile of the AQ distribution). We found no main effect of ‘number of sessions’ (<italic>F</italic>(1,7) = 0.25, p = 0.66), a main effect of ‘group’ (<italic>F</italic>(1,7) = 2.52, p = 0.015), and no interaction between the two subsample of participants and the sessions tested (<italic>F</italic>(1,7) = 0.51, p = 0.49). Data of Experiment 2 – visual updating– were separated into three sessions. For each session, we extracted the PSE and we conducted a repeated measure ANOVA with within-subject factor ‘sessions’ and between-subject factor ‘groups’ (lower vs upper quartile of the AQ distribution). Also here we found no main effect of sessions (<italic>F</italic>(1,13) = 0.86, p = 0.39), a main effect of group (<italic>F</italic>(1,14) = 11.85, p = 0.004), and no interaction between the two subsample of participants and the sessions tested (<italic>F</italic>(1,13) = 0.20, p = 0.73). In conclusion, the current study found no evidence of learning effects across the experimental sessions. However, a significant main effect of group was observed in both Experiment 1 (motor updating) and Experiment 2 (visual updating). Participants in the group with higher autistic traits performed systematically differently on the task, regardless of the number of sessions completed compared to those in the group with lower autistic traits.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the current study, we examined oculomotor efference copy signals in a sample of healthy adults with variable autistic traits using both, a motor and visual updating task. We show that a disrupted efference copy mechanism can lead to inaccurate predictions about impending eye movements, forcing the visuo-motor system to rely more heavily on actual sensory input rather than the anticipated sensory consequences of self-generated eye movements.</p><p>In our first experiment, the double-step saccade task, we found an impairment in the capacity of participants exhibiting high levels of autistic traits to program double-step saccades which require efference copy information about the size of the previous saccade. Conversely, participants with relatively low autistic characteristic perform accurately in the double-step task. In the high-autism-like subsample, the final eye position after the second saccade markedly deviates from the position of the second target, and the magnitude of this error far surpasses that observed in the low-autism-like group. This specific impairment in the accuracy of second saccades lends support to the hypothesis that heightened autistic traits correlates with a deficit in constructing a spatial representation of the second target's location based on forward models of efference copy. Notably, the mislocalization of the second saccade target cannot be explained by differences in the dynamics of the saccade to the first target: The observation that the accuracy of the initial saccade in the double-step task remains consistent regardless of the degree of autism-like trait severity implies that individuals with more pronounced traits do not exhibit inherent challenges in the encoding and processing of spatial information for intended saccades. Instead, when preparing for a saccade that must compensate for a preceding eye movement that altered the retinotopic representation of the target, those with more severe traits encounter difficulties. Likewise, the bias in localizing the target cannot be attributed to working memory deficits within our high-autism-like-symptom subsample; it is improbable that the mislocalization of the second target results solely from documented working memory deficits in ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Our findings suggest that a general memory deficit is unlikely to fully explain the observed bias in high-AQ participants' second saccades. As highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, the bias was specific to the horizontal dimension, weakening the argument for a global memory issue affecting both vertical and horizontal encoding of target location. A <italic>t</italic>-test between our group of participants revealed a difference in saccade accuracy for the <italic>x</italic> dimension (p = 0.03) but not in the <italic>y</italic> dimension (p = 0.88). However, it is important to acknowledge that even under non-darkness conditions, participants might rely on a combination of internal updating based on the initial target location and visual cues from the environment, such as screen borders. This potential use of visual references could contribute to the observed bias in the high-AQ group. If high-AQ participants differed in their reliance on visual cues compared to the low-AQ group, it could explain the specific pattern of altered remapping observed in the horizontal dimension. This possibility aligns with our argument for an abnormal remapping process underlying the results. While altered efference copy signals remain a strong candidate, the potential influence of visual cues on remapping in this population warrants further investigation. Future studies could incorporate a darkness condition to isolate the effects of internal updating on the first saccade, and systematically manipulate the availability of visual cues throughout the task. This would allow for a more nuanced understanding of how internal updating and visual reference use interact in the double-step paradigm, particularly for individuals with varying AQ scores.</p><p>Autistic people show remarkable similarities to the symptoms of schizophrenia patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barlati et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hommer and Swedo, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Crescenzo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krieger et al., 2021</xref>). Both ASD and schizophrenia patients are considered to have impairments at both extremes, involving either an excessive or inadequate reliance on sensory signals, resulting in inflexible behavior and issues in recurrent neural network representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Idei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Philippsen and Nagai, 2018</xref>). Using a double-step saccade task, previous research has reported multiple lines of evidence demonstrating disrupted efference copy signals in schizophrenia. Importantly, similar to our findings, this disruption has implications for perceptual and motor precision, highlighting the interconnectedness of corollary discharge deficits and motor inflexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thakkar et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thakkar et al., 2015a</xref>).</p><p>A dramatic consequence of altered efference copy signaling is the inability to account for own eye movements when judging the location of a target presented intra-saccadically. The trans-saccadic localization task yielded results that provide further insights into the role of efference copy in individuals with varying levels of autistic traits. In this task, all participants, regardless of their autistic trait levels, successfully executed accurate saccades to peripheral targets. However, the key factor emerged in the subsequent perceptual judgments made by these individuals. Individuals with high autistic traits exhibited a significant mislocalization of a remembered stimulus position across saccades. In essence, they perceived the visual stimulus as having shifted in space more than it actually did during the eye movement. This indicates that their brain is relying more on the actual sensory feedback than the efference copy prediction. The consequence is an inaccurate perception of the stimulus’ location in space.</p><p>The results of both experiments shed light on the relationship between efference copy failure and Bayesian theories of autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Van de Cruys et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pellicano and Burr, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lawson et al., 2014</xref>). In the double-step task, individuals with higher autistic traits exhibited difficulties in utilizing efference copy signals to construct a spatial representation of the second target location. This impairment suggests that in high autistic characteristics pre-saccadic predictions will never be completely confirmed by the post-saccadic feedback. This constant lack of a successful match between predicted sensory consequences of self-generated eye movements and post-saccadic evidence can lead over time to the build-up of weak priors with high variance.</p><p>Similarly, in the trans-saccadic localization task, high autistic traits were associated with failures in spatial updating across saccade execution. These findings align with the Bayesian framework, where the brain continuously updates its internal model by combining sensory information with prior knowledge. In the context of autism, a failure in efference copy can further contribute to the unique sensory integration processes observed in individuals on the autism spectrum. Our results are supported by recent evidence on the clinical population. Using a blanking task in a group of children with and without Autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yao et al., 2021</xref>) suggested that that the ability to flexibly adjust the precision of priors may serve a protective function in autistic people, potentially influencing the severity of symptom presentation. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park et al., 2021</xref> highlighted a unique relationship between smooth pursuit quality and motion prediction in ASD: unlike typically developing children, those with ASD did not exhibit a central-tendency bias over time, suggesting deficits in integrating prior knowledge about environmental statistics.</p><p>We have recently suggested a disruption in causal inference in the high autistic characteristics, as these individuals tend to attribute post-saccadic errors to external factors – a dynamic and unstable world – rather than accurately linking them to their own motor actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pomè et al., 2023</xref>). Consequently, a bias in causal inference emerges, stemming from the efference copy disruption, where the brain struggles to correctly attribute the cause of motor errors, leading to a heightened reliance on sensory feedback instead of motor predictions. As previously postulated this skewed causal inference also interconnect with motor inflexibility. Inflexibility in the motor domain might also have consequences for visual stability. Here, participants with high autistic traits faced challenges in executing saccades with precision, particularly when compensating for previous eye movements that had altered target representations. In the trans-saccadic localization task, we observed that these individuals leaned more heavily on post-saccadic sensory feedback than efference copy predictions. This not only led to an inaccurate perception of stimuli location but also underscored their limited ability to update and adapt motor actions based on sensory information.</p><p>It is essential to note that our participant pool lacked pre-existing diagnoses before engaging in the experiments and we must address limitations associated with the AQ questionnaire. The AQ questionnaire demonstrates adequate test–retest reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baron-Cohen et al., 2001</xref>), normal distribution of sum scores in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hurst et al., 2007</xref>), and cross-cultural equivalence has been established in Dutch and Japanese samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoekstra et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kurita et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wakabayashi et al., 2006</xref>). The AQ effectively categorizes individuals into low, average, and high degrees of autistic traits, demonstrating sensitivity for both group and individual assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tennant and Conaghan, 2007</xref>).</p><p>However, evolving research underscores many aspects that are not fully captured by the self-administered questionnaire: for example, gender differences in ASD trait manifestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lai et al., 2011</xref>). Autistic females may exhibit more socially typical interests, often overlooked by professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Simcoe et al., 2023</xref>). Camouflaging behaviors, employed by autistic women to blend in, pose challenges for accurate diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cook et al., 2022</xref>). Late diagnoses are attributed to a lack of awareness, gendered traits, and outdated assessment tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zener, 2019</xref>). Moving forward, complementing AQ evaluations in the general population with other questionnaires, such as those assessing camouflaging abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hull et al., 2019</xref>), or motor skills in everyday situation (MOSES-test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hillus et al., 2019</xref>) becomes crucial for a comprehensive understanding of autistic traits.</p><p>In conclusion, our study underscores the critical role of efference copy in maintaining perceptual stability during eye movements and highlights its potential relevance to the sensory processing differences observed in individuals with heightened autistic traits. These findings contribute to our understanding of the complex interplay between prior knowledge, sensory integration, and motor control in the context of ASD, opening avenues for future research and potential interventions aimed at enhancing perceptual stability in this population.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MATLAB code to process data</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper and Mathworks<break/><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mathworks.com">https://mathworks.com</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Forty-two participants (31 females, mean age 23, SD = 4.19) took part to Experiment 1 (motor updating).

The stimuli consisted of two red dots (1.5° diameter), each flashed for one monitor frame with at least a temporal separation of 300 ms on average (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> for distribution of saccade offset and second stimulus onset).

Saccade amplitudes were averaged into 10 separate bins of ~30 trials each for first, and second saccades that passed the selection criteria. These criteria were applied to ensure that both saccades were large enough to reveal a putative deviation of the second saccade. If, for instance, the executed first saccade is much smaller than the required distance, the efference copy should signal a smaller amplitude, thus leading to smaller influences on the direction of the second saccade. We tested our hypothesis concerning impaired use of efference copy information in high autism phenotype by analyzing the direction of the second saccade. Specifically, we determined how far the second saccade deviated from the optimal vector that would have directed the gaze onto the target. We calculated the angle between the second saccade vector and the optimal vector connecting the starting position of the second saccade and the second saccade target (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These angles were computed separately for upward and downward saccades, but since they resulted in very similar values, we collapsed the data into upward angles only.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Experiment 2</title><p>We only analyzed trials where the saccade was performed between the presentation of the two dots (first dot at least 60 ms before the saccade, second dot after its completion), therefore, in retinotopic coordinates, the two dots were always displaced horizontally by about 10°. That is when the dots were presented on the screen, they appeared at a different location on the retina, horizontally separated by an angle of approximatively 10° (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In other words, each dot was perceived on the retina at a slightly different position in the visual field, due to horizontal displacement. That subjects perceived the dots displaced along a nearly vertical trajectory, indicates that the retinotopic displacement is largely compensated, ensuring spatial stability. However, small biases of reported direction can indicate relative failures in this stabilization process. To estimate biases in trans-saccadic updating, we varied the location of the second dot with the method of constant stimuli and asked subjects to report in 2AFC whether the second dot was more slanted to the right or to the left compared to the first one. Data were analyzed as psychometric functions, plotting the proportion of ‘rightward’ judgments as function of the position of the second dot relative to the first one. Distributions were fitted with cumulative Gaussian functions; the median of the curve estimated the PSE, or the position of the second dot that led to vertical stimulus displacement. A negative bias (PSE &lt;0) implies a bias toward seeing rightward displacement and a positive bias (PSE &gt;0) implies a bias toward seeing leftward displacement (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, dashed gray line). The former negative bias can be interpreted as an under-compensation of the saccade vector. Moreover, a trial was discarded if: (1) participants did not perform a saccade or they blinked during the execution of the saccade; (2) participants started the saccade before the extinction of the fixation point; (3) the amplitude was smaller than half of the required distance; (4) participants deviated more than 2.5° on the horizontal or vertical dimension when fixating.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Autistic quotient</title><p>All participants completed the self-administered AQ questionnaire, in the German or English validated version (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ruzich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Freitag et al., 2007</xref>). This contains 50 items, grouped in five subscales: attention switching, attention to detail, imagination, communication, and social skills. For each question, participants read a statement and selected the degree to which the statement best described them: ‘strongly agree’, ‘slightly agree’, ‘slightly disagree’, and ‘strongly disagree’. The standard scoring described in the original paper was used: 1 when the participant’s response was characteristic of ASD (slightly or strongly), 0 otherwise. Total scores ranged between 0 and 50, with higher scores indicating higher degrees of autistic traits. All participants scored below 32, the threshold above which a clinical assessment is recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baron-Cohen et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>The median of the scores for the first experiment was 16, with lower and upper quartiles of 13 and 19. Scores were normally distributed, as measured by the Jarque–Bera goodness-of-fit test of composite normality (JB = 0.98, p = 0.5). The median score of the subsample participants for Experiment 2 was 17, with lower and upper quartiles of 14 and 20. Scores were normally distributed, as measured by the Jarque–Bera goodness-of-fit test of composite normality (JB = 1.39, p = 0.31).</p><p>As we were interested in the effect of autistic personality traits on the results, correlation analyses were complemented with standard <italic>t</italic>-tests comparing the upper and lower quartiles of the AQ distribution’s scores for the two experiments separately. Both measures were accompanied with Bayes Factors estimation. Bayes Factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rouder et al., 2009</xref>) quantify the evidence for or against the null hypothesis as the ratio of the likelihoods for the experimental and the null hypothesis. We express it as the ratio, where negative numbers indicate that the null hypothesis is likely to be true, positive that it is more likely false. By convention, absolute Bayes Factors &gt;3 are considered substantial evidence for either the alternate or null hypothesis, &gt;10 strong evidence, and &gt;100 decisive.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Supervision, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The experimental procedure was approved by the local ethics committee of the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences of Heinrich-Heine-University, Düsseldorf (ethics approval number: PO01_2022_01).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-94946-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Data has been deposited in Zenodo (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11277648">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11277648</ext-link>).</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pomè</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Zimmermann</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2024">2024</year><data-title>Visuo-motor updating in individuals with heightened autistic traits</data-title><source>Zenodo</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5281/zenodo.11277648</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>AP discloses support for the research of this work from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie (Grant Agreement Number 101029574–APPROVE ‘Autistic Perception and the predictive role of visual experience’).

In this paper, the authors draw a link between sensory overload, a characteristic of autism spectrum disorder, and a disturbance in the corollary discharge mechanism. The authors substantiate their hypothesis with strong evidence from both the motor and perceptual domains. As a result, they broaden the clinical relevance of the corollary discharge mechanism to encompass autism spectrum disorder.</p><p>Public comments:</p><p>The authors write:</p><p>&quot;Imagine a scenario in which you're watching a video of a fast-moving car on a bumpy road. As the car hits a pothole, your eyes naturally make quick, involuntary saccades to keep the car in your visual field. Without a functional efference copy system, your brain would have difficulty accurately determining the current position of your eye in space, which in turn affects its ability to anticipate where the car should appear after each eye movement.&quot;</p><p>I appreciate the use of examples to clarify the concept of efference copy. However, I believe this example is more related to a gain-field mechanism, informing the system about the position of the eye with respect to the head, rather than an example of efference copy per-se.</p><p>Without an efference copy mechanism, the brain would have trouble to accurately determine where the eyes will be in space after an eye movement, and it will have trouble predicting the sensory consequences of the eye movement. But it can be argued that the gain-field mechanism would be sufficient to inform the brain about the current position of the eyes with respect the head.</p><p>The authors write:</p><p>&quot;In the double-step paradigm, two consecutive saccades are made to briefly displayed targets 21,22. The first saccade occurs without visual references, relying on internal updating to determine the eye's position.&quot;</p><p>Maybe I am missed something, but in the double-step paradigm the first saccade can occur without the help of visual references if no visual feedback is present, that is, when saccades are performed in total darkness. Was this the case for this experiment? I could not find details about room conditions in the methods. Please provide further details.</p><p>In case saccades were not performed in total darkness, then the first saccade can be based on the remembered location of the first target presented, which can be derived from the retinotopic trace of the first stimuli, as well as contribution from the surroundings, that is: the remembered relative location of the first target with respect to the screen border along the horizontal meridian (i.e. allocentric cues)</p><p>A similar logic could be applied to the second saccade. If the second saccade were based only on the retinotopic trace, without updating, then it would go up and 45 deg to the right, based on the example shown in Figure 1. With appropriate updating, the second saccade would go straight up. However, if saccades were not performed in total darkness, then the location of the second target could also be derived from its relationship with the surroundings (for example, the remembered distance from screen borders, i.e. allocentric cues).</p><p>If saccades were not performed in total darkness, the results shown in Figures 2 and 3 could then be related to: (i) differences in motor updating between AQ score groups; (ii) differences in the use of allocentric cues between AQ score groups; (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii). I believe this is a point worth mentioning in the discussion.&quot;</p><p>The authors write:</p><p>&quot;According to theories of saccadic suppression, an efference copy is necessary to predict the occurrence of a saccade.&quot;</p><p>I would also refer to alternative accounts, where saccadic suppression appears to arise as early as the retina, due to the interaction between the visual shift introduced by the eye movement, and the retinal signal associated with the probe used to measure saccadic suppression. This could potentially account for the scaling of saccadic suppression magnitude with saccade amplitude.</p><p>Idrees, S., Baumann, M.P., Franke, F., Münch, T.A. and Hafed, Z.M., 2020.

Efference copies allow the brain to make predictions about sensory outcomes of self-generated actions, and thus serve important roles in motor planning and maintaining visual stability. Consequently, disrupted efference copies have been posited as a potential mechanism underlying motor and sensory symptoms in psychopathology such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), but so far very few studies have directly investigated this theory. Therefore, this study makes an important contribution as an attempt to fill in this knowledge gap. The authors conducted two eye-tracking experiments examining the accuracy of motor planning and visual perception following a saccade, and found that participants with high autistic traits exhibited worse task performance (i.e., less accurate second saccade and biased perception of object displacement), consistent with their hypothesis of less impact of efference copies on motor and visual updating. Moreover, the motor and visual biases are positively correlated, indicative of a common underlying mechanism. These findings are promising and can have important implications for clinical intervention, if they can be replicated in a clinical sample.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors utilized well-established and rigorously designed experiments and sound analytic methods. This enables easy translations between similar work in non-human primates and humans and readily points to potential candidates for underlying neural circuits that could be further examined in follow-up studies (e.g., superior colliculus, frontal eye fields, mediodorsal thalamus). The finding of no association between initial saccade accuracy and level of autistic trait in both experiments also serves as an important control analysis and increases one's confidence in the conclusion that the observed differences in task performance were indeed due to disrupted efference copies, not confounding factors such as basic visual/motor deficits or issues with working memory. The strong correlation between the observed motor and visual biases further strengthens the claim that the findings from both experiments may be explained by the same underlying mechanism - disrupted efference copies. Lastly, the authors also presented a thoughtful and detailed mechanistic theory of how efference copy impairment may lead to ASD symptomatology, which can serve as a nice framework for more research into the role of efference copies in ASD.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Although the paper has a lot of strengths, the main weakness of the paper is that a direct link with sensory/motor symptoms cannot be established. As the authors have discussed, the most likely symptoms resulting from disrupted efference copies would be sensory overload and motor inflexibility. The measure used to quantify the level of autistic traits, Autistic Quotient (AQ), does not capture any sensory or motor characteristics of the Autism spectrum. Therefore, it is unknown whether those scored high on AQ in this study experienced high, or even any, sensory or motor difficulties. In other words, more evidence is needed to demonstrate a direct link between disrupted efference copies and sensory/motor symptoms in ASD.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.94946.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Pomè</surname><given-names>Antonella</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/024z2rq82</institution-id><institution>Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Düsseldorf</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zimmermann</surname><given-names>Eckart</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Düsseldorf</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p><p>This important study tests the hypothesis that a high autism quotient in neurotypical adults is strongly associated with suboptimal motor planning and visual updating after eye movements, which in turn, is related to a disrupted efference copy mechanism.

We now specify more carefully that our sample of participants consists of neurotypical adults scored for autistic traits and none of them was diagnosed with autism before participating in our experiment. Regarding the Autistic Quotient Questionnaire (AQ) on page 5 of the Introduction we now write:</p><p>“The autistic traits of the whole population form a continuum, with ASD diagnosis usually situated on the high end 31-33. Moreover, autistic traits share a genetic and biological etiology with ASD 34. Thus, quantifying autistic-trait-related differences in healthy people can provide unique perspectives as well as a useful surrogate for understanding the symptoms of ASD 31,35.”</p><p>In the Discussion (page 9) we now write:</p><p>”It is essential to note that our participant pool lacked pre-existing diagnoses before engaging in the experiments and we must address limitations associated with the AQ questionnaire. The AQ questionnaire demonstrates adequate test-retest reliability 36, normal distribution of sum scores in the general population 50, and cross-cultural equivalence has been established in Dutch and Japanese samples 51-53. The AQ effectively categorizes individuals into low, average, and high degrees of autistic traits, demonstrating sensitivity for both group and individual assessments 54.</p><p>However, evolving research underscores many aspects that are not fully captured by the self-administered questionnaire: for example, gender differences in ASD trait manifestation 55. Autistic females may exhibit more socially typical interests, often overlooked by professionals 56. Camouflaging behaviors, employed by autistic women to blend in, pose challenges for accurate diagnosis 57. Late diagnoses are attributed to a lack of awareness, gendered traits, and outdated assessment tools 58. Moving forward, complementing AQ evaluations in the general population with other questionnaires, such as those assessing camouflaging abilities 59, or motor skills in everyday situation (MOSES-test 60) becomes crucial for a comprehensive understanding of autistic traits.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Suggestions for improvement:</p><p>- Figure 5 is really interesting. I think it should be highlighted a bit more, perhaps even with a model that uses the results of both tasks to predict AQ scores.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. However, the sample size is relatively small for building a robust and generalizable model to predict AQ scores. Statistical models built on small datasets can be prone to overfitting, meaning that they might not accurately predict the AQ for new individuals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Some discussion of the memory demands of the tasks will be helpful. The authors argue that memory is not a factor, but some support for this is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an important point regarding the potential for memory demands to influence our results. We have now also investigated the accuracy of the second saccade separately for the x and y dimension. As also shown in figure 3 panel A, a motor bias was observed only in one dimension (x), weaking the argument of memory which would imply a bias in both directions (participants remembering the position of the target relative to both screen borders for example). We performed a t-test between our subsample of participants and indeed we found a difference in saccade accuracy for the x dimension (p = 0.03) but not in the y dimension (p = 0.88).</p><p>We now add these analyses in Discussion on page 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- With 3 sessions for each experiment, the authors also have data to look at learning. Did people with high AQ get better over time, or did the observed errors/biases persist throughout the experiment?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. On page 7 (Results) we now write:</p><p>” Understanding how these biases might change over time could provide further insights into this mechanism. Specifically, we investigated whether participants exhibited any learning effects throughout the experiments. For data of Experiment 1 – motor updating – we divided our data into 10 separate bins of 30 trials each. We conducted a repeated measure ANOVA with the within-subject factor “number of sessions” (two main sessions of 5 bins each, ~150 trials) and the between-subject factor “group” (lower vs upper quartile of the AQ distribution). We found no main effect of “number of sessions” (F(1,7) = 0.25, p = 0.66), a main effect of “group” (F(1,7) = 2.52, p = 0.015), and no interaction between the two subsample of participants and the sessions tested (F(1,7) = 0.51, p = 0.49). Data of Experiment 2 – visual updating– were separated into 3 sessions. For each session we extracted the PSE and we conducted a repeated measure ANOVA with within subject factor “sessions” and between subject factor “groups” (lower vs upper quartile of the AQ distribution). Also here we found no main effect of sessions (F(1,13) = 0.86, p = 0.39), a main effect of group (F(1,14) = 11.85, p = 0.004), and no interaction between the two subsample of participants and the sessions tested (F(1,13) = 0.20, p = 0.73). In conclusion, the current study found no evidence of learning effects across the experimental sessions. However, a significant main effect of group was observed in both Experiment 1 (motor updating) and Experiment 2 (visual updating). Participants in the group with higher autistic traits performed systematically differently on the task, regardless of the number of sessions completed compared to those in the group with lower autistic traits.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The idea that various clinical conditions may be associated, at least partially, with a disrupted corollary discharge mechanism has been present for a long time.</p><p>In this paper, the authors draw a link between sensory overload, a characteristic of autism spectrum disorder, and a disturbance in the corollary discharge mechanism. The authors substantiate their hypothesis with strong evidence from both the motor and perceptual domains. As a result, they broaden the clinical relevance of the corollary discharge mechanism to encompass autism spectrum disorder.</p><p>The authors write:</p><p>&quot;Imagine a scenario in which you're watching a video of a fast-moving car on a bumpy road. As the car hits a pothole, your eyes naturally make quick, involuntary saccades to keep the car in your visual field. Without a functional efference copy system, your brain would have difficulty accurately determining the current position of your eye in space, which in turn affects its ability to anticipate where the car should appear after each eye movement.&quot;</p><p>I appreciate the use of examples to clarify the concept of efference copy. However, I believe this example is more related to a gain-field mechanism, informing the system about the position of the eye with respect to the head, rather than an example of efference copy per se.</p><p>Without an efference copy mechanism, the brain would have trouble accurately determining where the eyes will be in space after an eye movement, and it will have trouble predicting the sensory consequences of the eye movement. However it can be argued that the gain-field mechanism would be sufficient to inform the brain about the current position of the eyes with respect to the head.</p></disp-quote><p>We now used a different example. And on page 3 of Introduction, we now write:</p><p>“During a tennis game, rapid oculomotor saccades are employed to track the high-velocity ball across the visual display. In the absence of a functional efference copy mechanism, the brain would encounter difficulty in anticipating the precise retinal location of the ball following each saccade. This could result in a transient period of visual disruption as the visual system adjusts to the new eye position. The efference copy, by predicting the forthcoming sensory consequences of the saccade, would bridge this gap and facilitate the maintenance of a continuous and accurate representation of the ball's trajectory.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors write:</p><p>&quot;In the double-step paradigm, two consecutive saccades are made to briefly displayed targets 21, 22. The first saccade occurs without visual references, relying on internal updating to determine the eye's position.&quot;</p><p>Maybe I have missed something, but in the double-step paradigm the first saccade can occur without the help of visual references if no visual feedback is present, that is, when saccades are performed in total darkness. Was this the case for this experiment? I could not find details about room conditions in the methods. Please provide further details.</p><p>In case saccades were not performed in total darkness, then the first saccade can be based on the remembered location of the first target presented, which can be derived from the retinotopic trace of the first stimuli, as well as the contribution from the surroundings, that is: the remembered relative location of the first target with respect to the screen border along the horizontal meridian (i.e. allocentric cues).</p><p>A similar logic could be applied to the second saccade. If the second saccade were based only on the retinotopic trace, without updating, then it would go up and 45 deg to the right, based on the example shown in Figure 1. With appropriate updating, the second saccade would go straight up. However, if saccades were not performed in total darkness, then the location of the second target could also be derived from its relationship with the surroundings (for example, the remembered distance from screen borders, i.e. allocentric cues).</p><p>If saccades were not performed in total darkness, the results shown in Figures 2 and 3 could then be related to (i) differences in motor updating between AQ score groups; (ii) differences in the use of allocentric cues between AQ score groups; (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii). I believe this is a point worth mentioning in the discussion.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising the important issue of visual references in the double-step saccade task. Participants performed saccades in a dimly lit room where visual references, i.e. the screen borders, were barely visible. At the time we collected the data a laboratory that allowed performing experiments in complete darkness was not at our disposal. We acknowledge the possibility that participants could have memorized the target locations relative to the screen borders. The bias of high AQ participants could then be attributed to differences in either encoding, memorization or decoding of the target location relative to the screen borders. However, the potentially abnormal use of visual references must reflect an altered remapping process since we did not find differences in saccade landing in the vertical dimension. A t-test between our group of participants revealed a difference in saccade accuracy for the x dimension (p = 0.03) but not in the y dimension (p = 0.88). We thus agree that in addition to an altered efference copy signal in high AQ participants, altered use of visual references might also affect their saccadic remapping.</p><p>In Discussion we now write: “Our findings suggest that a general memory deficit is unlikely to fully explain the observed bias in high-AQ participants' second saccades. As highlighted in Figure 3A, the bias was specific to the horizontal dimension, weakening the argument for a global memory issue affecting both vertical and horizontal encoding of target location. However, it's important to acknowledge that even under non-darkness conditions, participants might rely on a combination of internal updating based on the initial target location and visual cues from the environment, such as screen borders. This potential use of visual references could contribute to the observed bias in the high-AQ group. If high-AQ participants differed in their reliance on visual cues compared to the low-AQ group, it could explain the specific pattern of altered remapping observed in the horizontal dimension. This possibility aligns with our argument for an abnormal remapping process underlying the results. While altered efference copy signals remain a strong candidate, the potential influence of visual cues on remapping in this population warrants further investigation. Future studies could incorporate a darkness condition to isolate the effects of internal updating on the first saccade, and systematically manipulate the availability of visual cues throughout the task. This would allow for a more nuanced understanding of how internal updating and visual reference use interact in the double-step paradigm, particularly for individuals with varying AQ scores “.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors write:</p><p>According to theories of saccadic suppression, an efference copy is necessary to predict the occurrence of a saccade.&quot;</p><p>I would also refer to alternative accounts, where saccadic suppression appears to arise as early as the retina, due to the interaction between the visual shift introduced by the eye movement, and the retinal signal associated with the probe used to measure saccadic suppression. This could potentially account for the scaling of saccadic suppression magnitude with saccade amplitude.</p><p>Idrees, S., Baumann, M.P., Franke, F., Münch, T.A. and Hafed, Z.M., 2020.

Now on page 4 of Introduction we write:</p><p>“Some theories consider saccadic omission and saccadic suppression as resulting from an active mechanism. In this view an efference copy would signal the occurrence of a saccade, yielding a transient decrease in visual sensitivity20-22. Others however have pointed out the possibility that a purely passive mechanism suffices to induce saccadic omission23. A recent study has found evidence for saccadic suppression already in the retina. Idrees et al.24 demonstrated that retinal ganglion cells in isolated retinae of mice and pigs respond to saccade-like displacements, leading to the suppression of responses to additional flashed visual stimuli through visually triggered retinal-circuit mechanisms. Importantly, their findings suggest that perisaccadic modulations of contrast sensitivity may have a purely visual origin, challenging the need for an efference copy in the early stages of saccadic suppression. However, the suppression they measured lasted much longer than time-courses observed in behavioral data. An efference copy signal could thus be necessary to release perception from suppression.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work examined efference copy related to eye movements in healthy adults who have high autistic traits. Efference copies allow the brain to make predictions about sensory outcomes of self-generated actions, and thus serve important roles in motor planning and maintaining visual stability. Consequently, disrupted efference copies have been posited as a potential mechanism underlying motor and sensory symptoms in psychopathology such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), but so far very few studies have directly investigated this theory. Therefore, this study makes an important contribution as an attempt to fill in this knowledge gap. The authors conducted two eye-tracking experiments examining the accuracy of motor planning and visual perception following a saccade and found that participants with high autistic traits exhibited worse task performance (i.e., less accurate second saccade and biased perception of object displacement), consistent with their hypothesis of less impact of efference copies on motor and visual updating. Moreover, the motor and visual biases are positively correlated, indicative of a common underlying mechanism. These findings are promising and can have important implications for clinical intervention if they can be replicated in a clinical sample.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors utilized well-established and rigorously designed experiments and sound analytic methods. This enables easy translations between similar work in non-human primates and humans and readily points to potential candidates for underlying neural circuits that could be further examined in follow-up studies (e.g., superior colliculus, frontal eye fields, mediodorsal thalamus). The finding of no association between initial saccade accuracy and level of autistic trait in both experiments also serves as an important control analysis and increases one's confidence in the conclusion that the observed differences in task performance were indeed due to disrupted efference copies, not confounding factors such as basic visual/motor deficits or issues with working memory. The strong correlation between the observed motor and visual biases further strengthens the claim that the findings from both experiments may be explained by the same underlying mechanism - disrupted efference copies. Lastly, the authors also presented a thoughtful and detailed mechanistic theory of how efference copy impairment may lead to ASD symptomatology, which can serve as a nice framework for more research into the role of efference copies in ASD.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Although the paper has a lot of strengths, the main weakness of the paper is that a direct link with ASD symptoms (i.e., sensory overload and motor inflexibility as the authors suggested) cannot be established. First of all, the participants are all healthy adults who do not meet the clinical criteria for an ASD diagnosis. Although they could be considered a part of the broader autism phenotype, the results cannot be easily generalized to the clinical population without further research. Secondly, the measure used to quantify the level of autistic traits, Autistic Quotient (AQ), does not actually capture any sensory or motor symptoms of ASD. Therefore, it is unknown whether those who scored high on AQ in this study experienced high, or even any, sensory or motor difficulties. In other words, more evidence is needed to demonstrate a direct link between disrupted efference copies and sensory/motor symptoms in ASD.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid point, and we thank the reviewer for raising it up. Moving forward, complementing AQ evaluations in the general population with other questionnaires, such as those assessing camouflaging abilities (Hull, L., Mandy, W., Lai, MC., et al., 2019), or motor skills in everyday situation (MOSES-test, Hillus J, Moseley R, Roepke S, Mohr B. 2019 ) becomes crucial for a comprehensive understanding of autistic traits.”</p><p>We now address this point in Discussion page 9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Minor comments</p><p>- The pothole example in the introduction was really hard to follow.

We now eliminated the term “severe”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The results section would read better if each experiment had a short paragraph reiterating its overall goal and the specific approach each experiment took to achieve that goal.</p></disp-quote><p>Now on page 5, for the first experiment, we write:</p><p>”We investigated the influence of autistic traits on visual updating during saccadic eye movements using a classic double-step saccade task. This task relies on participants making two consecutive saccades to briefly presented targets. The accuracy of the second saccade serves as an indirect measure of how effectively the participant's brain integrated the execution of the first saccade into their internal representation of visual space. Participants were divided into quartiles based on the severity of their autistic traits, as assessed by the Autistic quotient questionnaire (cite). We hypothesized that individuals with higher autistic traits would exhibit greater difficulty in visual updating compared to those with lower autistic traits. This would be reflected in reduced accuracy of their second saccades in the double-step task. Figure 2C illustrates examples from participants at the extremes of the autistic trait distribution (Autistic quotient = 3, in orange and Autistic quotient = 31, in magenta). As shown, both participants were instructed to make saccades to the locations indicated by two brief target appearances (T1 and T2), as quickly and accurately as possible, following the order of presentation. However, successful execution of the second saccade requires accurate internal compensation for the first saccade, without any visual references or feedback available during the saccade itself.”</p><p>On page 6, for experiment 2, we write:</p><p>”With a trans-saccadic localization task, we explored how autistic traits affect the integration of eye movements into visual perception. Participants were presented with stimuli before and after a single saccade, creating an illusion of apparent motion. We measured the perceived direction of this displacement, which is influenced by how well the participant's brain accounts for the saccadic eye movement. We predicted that individuals with higher autistic traits would show a stronger bias in the perceived displacement direction, suggesting a less accurate integration of the eye movement into their visual perception.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- On page 6, the text about &quot;vertical displacement&quot; is confusing. The spatial displacements in this experiment were horizontal?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, they were. The spatial displacement is horizontal, but the perceived trajectory (due to the saccade) is vertical. We now changed “vertical displacement” to “vertical trajectory”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Page 6, grammatical problems in &quot;while we report a slightly slant of the dots trajectory&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. Now fixed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- It would be helpful to discuss the apparent motion part of Experiment 2 in the main text. This important part is not made clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We now in Introduction, page 4, write:</p><p>“In this paradigm, one stimulus is shown before and another after saccade execution. Together these two stimuli produce the perception of “apparent motion”. If stimuli are placed such that the apparent motion path is orthogonal to the saccade path, then the orientation of the apparent motion path indicates how the saccade vector is integrated into vision. The apparent motion trajectory can only appear vertical if the movement of the eyes is perfectly accounted for, that is the retinotopic displacement is largely compensated, ensuring spatial stability. However, small biases of motion direction – implying under- (or over-) compensation of the eye movement – can indicate relative failures in this stabilization process. In a seminal study, Szinte and Cavanagh 27 found a slight over-compensation of the saccade vector leading to apparent motion slightly tilted against the direction of the saccade. More importantly, when efference copies are not available, i.e. localization occurring at the time of a second saccade in a double step task, a strong saccade under-compensation occurs 28.</p><p>This phenomenon cannot be explained by perisaccadic mislocalization of flashed visual stimuli 29,30, but the two phenomena may be related in that they may both depend upon efference copy information.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 1 could be improved.
