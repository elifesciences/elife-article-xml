relies on the ParABS partitioning system and the SMC complex. In this work, we used single-molecule techniques to investigate the role of cytidine triphosphate (CTP) binding and hydrolysis in the critical interaction between centromere-like <italic>parS</italic> DNA sequences and the ParB CTPase. Using a combined optical tweezers confocal microscope, we observe the specific interaction of ParB with <italic>parS</italic> directly. Binding around <italic>parS</italic> is enhanced by the presence of CTP or the non-hydrolysable analogue CTPγS. However, ParB proteins are also detected at a lower density in distal non-specific DNA. This requires the presence of a <italic>parS</italic> loading site and is prevented by protein roadblocks, consistent with one-dimensional diffusion by a sliding clamp. ParB diffusion on non-specific DNA is corroborated by direct visualization and quantification of movement of individual quantum dot labelled ParB. Magnetic tweezers experiments show that the spreading activity, which has an absolute requirement for CTP binding but not hydrolysis, results in the condensation of <italic>parS</italic>-containing DNA molecules at low nanomolar protein concentrations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ParB</kwd><kwd>ParABS systems</kwd><kwd>chromosome segregation</kwd><kwd>magnetic tweezers</kwd><kwd>single-molecule techniques</kwd><kwd>optical tweezers</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>B. subtilis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>681299</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moreno-Herrero</surname><given-names>Fernando</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>100401/Z/12/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dillingham</surname><given-names>Mark Simon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>BBSRC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>South West Biosciences Doctoral Training studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fisher</surname><given-names>Gemma LM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>MINECO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2017-83794-P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moreno-Herrero</surname><given-names>Fernando</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012818</institution-id><institution>Comunidad de Madrid</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Tec4Bio – S2018/NMT-4443</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moreno-Herrero</surname><given-names>Fernando</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012818</institution-id><institution>Comunidad de Madrid</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NanoBioCancer - Y2018/BIO-4747</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moreno-Herrero</surname><given-names>Fernando</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-molecule methods reveal that cytidine triphosphate promotes DNA condensation specifically at bacterial centromeres by facilitating one-dimensional diffusion of ParB from <italic>parS</italic> sites.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In bacterial cells, the separation of sister chromosomes is performed by the ParABS system and the SMC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Britton et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ireton et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jensen and Shapiro, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marbouty et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mohl and Gober, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Song and Loparo, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). The ParABS system consists of the ATPase protein ParA, the DNA-binding protein ParB, and a centromere-like palindromic DNA sequence named <italic>parS</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Funnell, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin and Grossman, 1998</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic> imaging experiments in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> showed that multiple ParB proteins co-localize with SMC complexes at a given <italic>parS</italic> site forming distinctive clusters in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gruber and Errington, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Minnen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sullivan et al., 2009</xref>). Notably, chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP) experiments indicate that ParB covers regions of up to 18 kilobase pairs (kbp) of DNA surrounding <italic>parS</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breier and Grossman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Graham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Minnen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murray et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rodionov et al., 1999</xref>), a phenomenon named <italic>spreading</italic>. Originally, this spreading was interpreted as the formation of a nucleoprotein filament extending from a <italic>parS</italic> nucleation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murray et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rodionov et al., 1999</xref>). However, it later became clear that ParB foci contained far too few proteins to coat tens of kbp-long DNA segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Graham et al., 2014</xref>). Instead, we and others have shown that ParB can self-associate to form networks which include specific binding to <italic>parS</italic> sequences but also non-specific binding to distal DNA segments. Overall, this results in the condensation and bridging of DNA at low forces (below 1 pN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fisher et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Graham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Madariaga-Marcos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Madariaga-Marcos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>), and could explain how distant regions of DNA are bound by limited numbers of ParB proteins as shown in ChIP experiments. However, DNA condensation has only been observed <italic>in vitro</italic> at high ParB concentrations, in the low micromolar range. Moreover, and unexpectedly, <italic>parS</italic> sequences did not affect DNA condensation under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, the mechanism of ParB spreading and condensation, and in particular the molecular basis for the specific localization around <italic>parS</italic>, has remained unclear despite extensive investigation <italic>in vivo</italic>, <italic>in vitro</italic>, and <italic>in silico</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Broedersz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guilhas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sanchez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Walter et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>ParB proteins comprise three distinct domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). The N-terminal domain (NTD) binds ParA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bouet and Funnell, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Radnedge et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vecchiarelli et al., 2010</xref>) and was recently appreciated to contain a CTP-binding pocket that serves as a CTP-dependent dimerization interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Osorio-Valeriano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Soh et al., 2019</xref>). Mutation R80A in the CTP-binding pocket has been shown to impair nucleoid segregation and ParB spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Autret et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breier and Grossman, 2007</xref>). A central DNA-binding domain (CDBD) binds specifically to the palindromic <italic>parS</italic> sequence and may also facilitate dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leonard et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schumacher and Funnell, 2005</xref>). In this central region, the mutation R149G within a helix-turn-helix motif impedes <italic>parS</italic> binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Autret et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fisher et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gruber and Errington, 2009</xref>). Finally, the C-terminal domain (CTD) forms dimers with a lysine-rich surface that binds to DNA non-specifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fisher et al., 2017</xref>). Interactions between CTDs are essential for condensation <italic>in vitro</italic> and for the formation of ParB foci <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fisher et al., 2017</xref>). Based upon these results, we proposed a model for DNA condensation dependent on ParB CTD dimerization and non-specific DNA (nsDNA) binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fisher et al., 2017</xref>). Further work using lateral pulling of long DNA molecules in a magnetic tweezers (MT) setup combined with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) demonstrated that ParB networks are highly dynamic and display a continual exchange of protein-protein and protein-DNA interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Madariaga-Marcos et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Recently, two laboratories demonstrated independent that <italic>B. subtilis</italic> ParB and the <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> ParB hydrolyse cytidine triphosphate (CTP) to cytidine diphosphate (CDP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Osorio-Valeriano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Soh et al., 2019</xref>) and require CTP for partition complex formation <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Osorio-Valeriano et al., 2019</xref>). Importantly, <italic>parS</italic> DNA stimulates the binding and hydrolysis of CTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Osorio-Valeriano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Soh et al., 2019</xref>), CTP has been shown to be necessary for ParB spreading <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jalal et al., 2020</xref>), and a model has been proposed in which centromeres assemble via the loading of ParB-DNA sliding clamps at <italic>parS</italic> sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jalal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Soh et al., 2019</xref>). These observations fundamentally change our understanding of how ParB can become engaged with nsDNA surrounding <italic>parS</italic>, but the significance of CTP-dependent spreading in the formation of the ParB networks that cause DNA bridging and condensation has not been addressed.</p><p>Here, we investigated the role of CTP binding and hydrolysis in the binding of ParB to <italic>parS</italic> sequences and nsDNA at the single-molecule level. We present the first visualization of the specific binding of ParB to <italic>parS</italic>. ParB proteins were also detected at nsDNA far from <italic>parS,</italic> albeit at a much lower density. Importantly, this only occurred in <italic>parS</italic>-containing DNA, suggesting spreading from <italic>parS</italic> sites. The placement of tight-binding protein roadblocks on DNA constrained the spreading, suggesting it arises from one-dimensional movement along the contour of DNA, consistent with a sliding clamp model. CTP binding mediated by a Mg<sup>2+</sup> cofactor, but not CTP hydrolysis, was critical for spreading from <italic>parS</italic> to non-<italic>parS</italic> sites which triggered DNA condensation at nanomolar protein concentration. We propose a model where ParB-CTP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> loads to <italic>parS</italic>, diffuses to non-<italic>parS</italic> sites, and then self-associates, resulting in the condensation of kbp-long DNA molecules.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Direct visualization of the specific binding of ParB to <italic>parS</italic> sequences</title><p>In our previous work, performed in the absence of CTP, we used a combination of TIRFM and DNA stretching (by either flow or MTs) to visualize binding of ParB to long DNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Madariaga-Marcos et al., 2019</xref>). Although specific ParB-<italic>parS</italic> interactions have been detected in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>), they have not yet been observed directly.

In this approach, DNA molecules are perpendicular to the optical axis of the microscope providing a homogeneous illumination along the molecule and confocal imaging provides a very high signal-to-noise ratio (albeit with a limited spatial resolution of around 250 nm). Additionally, the force applied to DNA is better defined and more uniform than in flow-stretch experiments.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Direct visualization of ParB specific binding to <italic>parS</italic> sites.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domains and functional motifs of ParB as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartosik et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kusiak et al., 2011</xref>).

To amplify the potential signal from specific binding to <italic>parS</italic> sites, we used a DNA substrate that contains 39 copies of the partially degenerate <italic>parS</italic> sequence (5'-<named-content content-type="sequence">TGTTCCACGTGAAACA</named-content>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breier and Grossman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>) arranged in two clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> ). Then, we incubated the DNA with 20 nM ParB<sup>AF488</sup> and took confocal images of the region of interest, including the beads as a reference, in the presence and absence of CTP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The images clearly showed two bright regions, one larger than the other, corresponding to the two <italic>parS</italic> clusters separated by 1905 bp. Note that, due to the design of the molecule (see Materials and methods), double-length substrates can also be generated and trapped between the beads. In this case, the number of bright clusters were doubled, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Fluorescence intensity profiles of ParB correlated with the position of the <italic>parS</italic> clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Importantly, ParB binding to <italic>parS</italic> did not require CTP in agreement with previous EMSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>) and bio-layer interferometric analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jalal et al., 2020</xref>). However, the presence of CTP enhanced the fluorescence intensity within the <italic>parS</italic> clusters by three- to four-fold compared to in the absence of CTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Previously, we showed that the ParB binding equilibrium is established rapidly (within tens of seconds; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Madariaga-Marcos et al., 2019</xref>) compared to our incubation time before confocal imaging. Therefore, these images represent the steady-state occupancy of ParB on DNA and the higher fluorescence intensity measured in the CTP case reflects a greater number of ParB molecules bound at or around the <italic>parS</italic> sequences compared to the no CTP condition. It is formally possible that the higher fluorescence measured in the presence of CTP could reflect a fluorescence enhancement effect, but this is unlikely since the ParB labelling site (S68C) is on a surface-exposed loop that is distant from the buried CTP molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Soh et al., 2019</xref>). In some images, a faint fluorescence signal was also observed outside the <italic>parS</italic> region (see red arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) in the CTP and CTPγS conditions and we will return to this point later. Control experiments with non-<italic>parS</italic> DNA did not show any protein binding at this ParB concentration (see below). This is the first direct visualization of ParB association specifically and precisely at <italic>parS</italic> sequences, and shows that this interaction is mediated by CTP binding in agreement with recently published works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jalal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Osorio-Valeriano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Soh et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Next, we investigated the dynamics of the ParB-DNA interaction by taking kymographs with CTP/CTPγS or in the absence of nucleotide (see Materials and methods). The fluorescence intensity at the <italic>parS</italic> sites decayed with time but ParB remained visible for 30 s in both CTP/CTPγS conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A and B</xref>). This helped to reveal the positioning of ParB relative to the <italic>parS</italic> sites throughout the 30 s kymograph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C</xref>). The 39<italic>× parS</italic> DNA substrate includes two sequence clusters separated by 1905 bp, the smaller of which contains two groups of closely spaced <italic>parS</italic> sequences, and the larger of which contains four such groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C</xref>). The 30 s average intensity profile clearly distinguished six foci corresponding to groups of ParB molecules precisely at their expected positions. The gradual decay of the fluorescence over tens of seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4D</xref>) indicates that the photobleaching kinetics are faster than the rates of ParB binding and unbinding. If the opposite were true, then efficient protein turnover would result in a constant fluorescence level as was observed in our previous experiments performed at much higher ParB concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Madariaga-Marcos et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>ParB spreading from <italic>parS</italic> sites occurs by sliding and requires CTP binding but not hydrolysis</title><p>With the aim of exploring ParB spreading from <italic>parS</italic> sites to distal DNA sites, we performed experiments in which we incubated the ParB protein with the DNA for 2 min before illuminating the sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). By doing this, we prevented photobleaching of the proteins in the process of loading and spreading. We then compared the fluorescence intensity profiles of the first images obtained after incubation under different experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Importantly, ParB proteins were now more clearly identified outside of the <italic>parS</italic> region (compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), but only under CTP or CTPγS conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Indeed, ParB proteins were sparsely distributed along the entire non-specific region (i.e., they did not only accumulate at or near the <italic>parS</italic> cluster) (red arrow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The CDP case was also studied (data not shown) and produced intensities very similar to the no nucleotide case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This is consistent with the negligible affinity of this nucleotide for ParB reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Osorio-Valeriano et al., 2019</xref>. The intensity in this non-<italic>parS</italic> region decayed within 1–2 s, an apparently shorter timescale than in the <italic>parS</italic> regions (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Animation 1</xref>), re-enforcing the idea that protein turnover is slow compared to photobleaching. Crucially, a control experiment using a non-<italic>parS</italic> DNA showed no protein bound at all in the presence of CTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>), supporting the notion that proteins located outside <italic>parS</italic> reached that location through the <italic>parS</italic> entry site.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cytidine triphosphate (CTP) binding promotes ParB spreading from <italic>parS</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon of the experiment.

Therefore, to investigate the mechanism by which ParB spreads to non-specific sites, we fabricated a 17 kbp DNA molecule that contains the same 39× <italic>parS</italic> cluster flanked by two groups of 5× EcoRI sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These sequences would act as roadblocks after binding of EcoRI<sup>E111G</sup>, a catalytically inactive variant of the EcoRI restriction enzyme which has been used as a model protein roadblock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brüning et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">King et al., 1989</xref>). Note that, if movement of ParB occurs along the contour of DNA (i.e., by sliding from <italic>parS</italic>), then we expect ~5 and ~1 kbp DNA segments of the molecule to remain free of ParB proteins. Additionally, the molecule contains a ~3.6 kbp non-<italic>parS</italic> area between the last <italic>parS</italic> sequence of the 39× <italic>parS</italic> cluster and one of the 5× EcoRI sites which we would expect to become populated with ParB via a sliding mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The imaging experiments were performed as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> but included an additional incubation step with 100 nM EcoRI<sup>E111G</sup>, prior to incubation with ParB<sup>AF488</sup>. The confocal laser was turned on after the incubations with EcoRI<sup>E111G</sup> and ParB<sup>AF488</sup>, and confocal images were obtained on a tandem EcoRI 39× <italic>parS</italic> DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). As expected, brighter regions correlated very well with the <italic>parS</italic> clusters. Importantly, a faint region also appeared flanking the <italic>parS</italic> cluster and bordered by the EcoRI<sup>E111G</sup> roadblocks, which appeared to have constrained ParB spreading (see red arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Indeed, fluorescence profiles showed high intensity associated with the <italic>parS</italic> region, lower intensity signals produced by ParB spreading from <italic>parS</italic> (see red arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), and no signal associated with regions protected by EcoRI sites (see blue arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Subsequent confocal images reflected the photobleaching of this region in contrast with the brighter <italic>parS</italic> area, confirming the low exchange of proteins outside <italic>parS</italic> (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Animation 2</xref>). Control experiments omitting the EcoRI<sup>E111G</sup> incubation step reproduced our previous result with a uniform intensity profile along the whole DNA molecule (data not shown). Moreover, in order to exclude a potential confining effect due the high number of <italic>parS</italic> used in our substrates, we repeated these experiments using a DNA containing 7 copies of <italic>parS</italic> (C-trap EcoRI 7× <italic>parS</italic> substrate, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Again, we observed enhanced binding at the <italic>parS</italic> sequences and blocking of ParB sliding by EcoRI<sup>E111G</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). Altogether, these experiments show that CTP binding promotes movement of ParB over kbp distances away from <italic>parS</italic> sites to non-specific regions of DNA. The fact that this movement can be constrained by protein roadblocks suggests that it occurs by sliding from <italic>parS</italic>.</p><media id="video2" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-67554-video2.gif"><label>Animation 2.</label><caption><title>ParB spreading is limited by protein roadblocks.</title><p>Video built from individual C-trap scans showing ParB binding to <italic>parS</italic>, and spreading to non-<italic>parS</italic> DNA up to the region confined by EcoRI<sup>E111G</sup>, and photobleaching of the fluorescence dye.</p></caption></media></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Direct visualization of ParB diffusion from <italic>parS</italic> sequences</title><p>With the aim of capturing the movement of individual ParB dimers along the DNA molecules, we generated quantum dot (QD) labelled ParB (ParB<sup>QD</sup>, see Materials and methods). QD labelling increased the fluorescence intensity of a single ParB protein and allowed much longer visualization times due to the absence of photobleaching. We used C-trap substrates including 7 or 2 copies of <italic>parS</italic> and recorded kymographs of several tens of seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, respectively). A clear and stable signal was observed at the <italic>parS</italic> region consistent with ParB binding to <italic>parS</italic>, as expected from previous experiments. However, ParB proteins also left the <italic>parS</italic> site, randomly explored the whole non-<italic>parS</italic> region and, very often, detached from nsDNA. We then measured the position of ParB along the DNA molecule (i.e., outside <italic>parS</italic>) for a given time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and determined the mean square displacement (MSD) for a time interval (Δ<italic>t</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) to obtain the diffusion constant (<italic>D</italic>) of ParB (see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gorman and Greene, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heller et al., 2014</xref>). The diffusion constant of ParB was 0.41±0.02 µm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (mean±SEM, <italic>n</italic>=177) or 3.5±0.2 × 10<sup>6</sup> bp<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, assuming a rise per base pair of 0.34 nm. In contrast, ParB proteins bound to <italic>parS</italic> remained mostly immobile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). These data are consistent with previous single-molecule experiments performed in the absence of CTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Graham et al., 2014</xref>) and with the recently calculated ParB diffusion constant of 0.7 µm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> using super-resolution microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guilhas et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, Guilhas et al. also reported a much lower value of 0.05 µm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> for ParB clustered in <italic>parS</italic> nucleoprotein condensates, which likely reflects our observation of immobile ParB proteins at <italic>parS</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

To overcome this issue, we and others stretched the DNA molecules using flow or magnetic pulling combined with TIRFM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Graham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Madariaga-Marcos et al., 2019</xref>). However, these experiments were performed in the absence of CTP and required high concentrations of ParB, conditions which allow ParB to interact directly (i.e., from free solution rather than via <italic>parS</italic> loading sites) with nsDNA. The recent discovery that ParB is a <italic>parS</italic>-dependent CTPase has led to the proposal of radically new models for ParB-DNA interactions in which <italic>parS</italic> acts as a loading site for ParB-DNA sliding clamps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Osorio-Valeriano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Soh et al., 2019</xref>).

Motivated by these important new observations, we have revisited our earlier single-molecule experiments using much lower concentrations of ParB in the presence of CTP. Our results confirm many aspects of the published models but also extend them, by addressing how CTP facilitates localized DNA condensation around <italic>parS</italic> sites.</p><p>In an attempt to visualize the specific binding of ParB to <italic>parS</italic> in the presence of CTP, Soh et al. observed stretched DNA bound to a glass surface using TIRFM and reported accumulation of ParB around <italic>parS</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Soh et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we used a combination of optical tweezers and confocal microscopy that allowed us not only to observe more precisely the direct binding of ParB to single DNA molecules, but also facilitated the quantification of fluorescence intensity around <italic>parS</italic> sites and distal non-specific sites. In our assay we found very good correlation between the position of ParB in time-averaged intensity profiles and the position of the groups of <italic>parS</italic> sites engineered into our substrate. These profiles easily allowed us to distinguish between the different orientations of substrate molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In these experiments, confocal illumination was initiated after a long ParB incubation with the substrate DNA such that the initial images should reflect equilibrium binding conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Madariaga-Marcos et al., 2019</xref>). In the absence of CTP, we observed a clear fluorescence intensity at <italic>parS</italic> sequences and a zero intensity (within error) in distal regions of nsDNA. We interpret this as reflecting the highly specific binding of ParB in an open clamp conformation directly to the <italic>parS</italic> sequences via the HtH motifs in the CDBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, step 1).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for ParB-dependent DNA condensation around <italic>parS</italic> sequences.</title><p>(Step 1) ParB binding to <italic>parS</italic> does not require cytidine triphosphate (CTP) as observed from C-trap experiments. <italic>ParS</italic>-bound apo-ParB does not spread from <italic>parS</italic>.

Alternatively, other protein-protein interaction such those mediated by the N-terminal domain (NTD) (shown in figure) or the central DNA-binding domain (CDBD) of ParB could result in DNA condensation.

Note that, because this is a single-molecule experiment, the increased intensity associated with the <italic>parS</italic> clusters strongly suggests that there is a higher density of ParB dimers on the DNA at or near (i.e., within the spatial resolution of the imaging; ~250 nm) <italic>parS</italic> sequences. We interpret this as the CTP binding-dependent conversion of <italic>parS</italic>-bound ParB dimers into sliding clamps that move into neighbouring regions of the DNA to allow additional ParB open clamps to be recruited to the DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, step 2). It is interesting to note that the presence of CTP and CTPγS does not prevent the initial binding of ParB to DNA by favouring a closed clamp structure <italic>before</italic> DNA association. This might suggest either that the DNA entry gate for ParB is a different interface (e.g., transient opening of the CTD) or simply that the CTP cannot bind efficiently until after DNA enters ParB though the NTD entry gate. In either case, following the formation of closed ParB clamps on DNA, we imagine that they spread but remain largely restrained to the region of nsDNA immediately surrounding <italic>parS</italic> sequences as a result of protein:protein interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, step 2, interlaced circles).

Direct evidence that these ParB molecules are indeed involved in one-dimensional (1D) sliding interactions with the DNA is provided by experiments using QD labelled ParB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We measured a diffusion constant for ParB of 0.41±0.02 µm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, in agreement with other reports that used single-molecules analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Graham et al., 2014</xref>) and super-resolution cell imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guilhas et al., 2020</xref>). Roadblock experiments with a catalytically inactive EcoRI mutant also supported 1D diffusion. The weaker fluorescence intensity associated with sparsely distributed ParB molecules in nsDNA regions was only observed in segments of DNA containing <italic>parS</italic> sequences and was corralled by EcoRI roadblocks placed either side of the centromere sequences.</p><p>Despite the fact that free ParB is always present in the imaging channel in our experiments, we observed a rapid decay of the fluorescence intensity upon illumination. This suggests that the photobleaching rate is faster than the binding and unbinding kinetics of ParB. Interestingly, we observed an apparently faster fluorescence loss at distal regions of nsDNA when compared to the regions close to <italic>parS</italic> (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Animation 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>). This likely reflects the much higher density of ParB that our model anticipates in <italic>parS</italic> regions compared to distal nsDNA, where we observed the fluorescence of individual diffusing proteins. Alternatively, continuous loading at <italic>parS</italic> may counteract the fluorescence decay caused by photobleaching to a greater extent than at distal DNA regions (where ParB cannot bind from free solution).</p><p>In order to investigate the effects of CTP on ParB-induced DNA condensation, we employed an MT apparatus. In the presence of CTP-Mg<sup>2+</sup>, ParB condensed <italic>parS</italic>-containing DNA at nanomolar concentrations, much lower than those reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fisher et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Importantly, this strong stimulatory effect of CTP on DNA condensation, which is completely specific for <italic>parS</italic>-containing DNA, helps to resolve the question of how ParB networks can form uniquely at <italic>parS</italic> loci within the huge bacterial chromosome. This had not been readily apparent from previous experiments performed without CTP (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Graham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Madariaga-Marcos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Taylor et al., 2015</xref> for discussion). Control experiments showed that efficient condensation required both the <italic>parS</italic> sequence and either CTP or CTPγS, suggesting that it is CTP binding but not its hydrolysis that is important for promoting condensation. The condensation force increased with the number of <italic>parS</italic> sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and a minimum value of between 5 and 7 sites was required to observe condensation, probably because a minimum force is always applied in these MT assays (see below).</p><p>We can interpret the behaviour observed in the MT using a simple extension of the model described above for the confocal microscopy experiments. In the MT experiment, the DNA ends are held apart by a very low force and the DNA is able to condense. Therefore, the ParB dimers which load around the <italic>parS</italic> sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, step 2), or those which diffuse to the nsDNA region, can self-associate bringing distal DNA parts together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, step 3). This creates a dynamic network of ParB molecules constraining DNA loops. Importantly, MT experiments including EcoRI roadblocks directly linked ParB diffusion with condensation because the DNA region non-accessible to ParB, due to EcoRI blocking, remained non-condensed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The greater the number of <italic>parS</italic> sequences present in the DNA, the greater will be the loading rate of ParB clamps into non-specific regions of the DNA, and the more stable will be the condensation against weak restraining forces. In vivo experiments have shown that a single <italic>parS</italic> is enough to promote chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Broedersz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jecz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). This might simply reflect the difference in ParB concentrations, or solution conditions that are found in vivo compared to our MT experiments. However, we favour the simplest explanation which relates to the difference in restraining forces between in vitro and in vivo conditions. Indeed, further experiments using TPM and AFM performed in the absence of force indicate that a single <italic>parS</italic> sequence is sufficient for DNA condensation under CTP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> conditions.</p><p>The molecular basis for the protein-protein interactions that hold the ParB network together in our model remains unclear and is an important subject for future study. ParB contains multiple non-exclusive interfaces within all three domains that could be relevant to this activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Song et al., 2017</xref>). For example, we have previously provided direct evidence that disruption of CTD-CTD interactions decondenses DNA in vitro and prevents the formation of ParB networks in vivo, so these protein-protein interactions may contribute to network formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, step 3). However, we note that our results can also be re-interpreted in the light of the new concept of topological engagement between DNA and a ParB toroidal clamp. If CTD-CTD interactions are important for closing the sliding clamp around DNA as has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jalal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Soh et al., 2019</xref>), then disruption of these interactions would dissolve ParB networks, not by breaking protein-protein interactions between ParB molecules, but rather by releasing the constrained DNA loops and promoting ParB dissociation into free solution. Other possible interfaces that may establish ParB networks include those that have been observed between the CDBD or NTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leonard et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schumacher and Funnell, 2005</xref>). A final open question concerns the loading of the SMC complexes at bacterial centromeres which leads to the individualization of bacterial chromosomes following DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hayes and Barillà, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schumacher, 2008</xref>). Despite the intimate functional relationship between the ParABS partitioning system and SMC complexes, the nature of the physical interactions between these systems and their regulation are not understood.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein preparation</title><p>WT-ParB, R149G ParB, and AF488-ParB were prepared as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fisher et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Madariaga-Marcos et al., 2019</xref>).

Mixtures of NTP (2×) and DNA (2×) in reaction buffer (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, and 0.1% Tween-20) were prepared on ice. Protein solutions (2×) containing either wild-type ParB or ParB<sup>AF488</sup> in reaction buffer were also prepared on ice. NTP/DNA pre-mix (5 μl) was added to protein solution (5 μl) and mixed on ice. Phosphate standards and blanks were prepared in parallel for each experiment.

Samples were diluted by the addition of 70 μl water, then mixed with 20 μl working reagent (WR) (Sigma, Ref MAK 307) and transferred to a flat-bottom 96-well plate. The plate was incubated for 30 min at 25°C and the absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 620 nm in a SpectraMax iD3 (VERTEX Technics) plate reader that uses the SoftMax Pro7 software. Readings were performed in rounds to preserve the same 30 min WR incubation time for all samples. Absorbance values from the phosphate standard samples were corrected with the absorbance for 0 μM phosphate. Absorbance values from the ParB samples were corrected by the reaction buffer absorbance (blank). Absorbance values from the phosphate standard samples were used to plot an OD<sub>620 nm</sub> versus pmol phosphate standard curve. All samples were tested in duplicate.

Briefly, optical images of micrometer-sized superparamagnetic beads tethered to a glass surface by DNA constructs are acquired with a 100× oil-immersion objective and a CCD camera. Real-time image videomicroscopy analysis determines the spatial coordinates of the beads with nm accuracy in the x, y, and z directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pastrana et al., 2016</xref>). A step motor located above the sample moves a pair of magnets allowing the application of stretching forces to the bead-DNA system. Applied forces can be quantified from the Brownian excursions of the bead and the extension of the DNA tether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Strick et al., 1998</xref>). Data were acquired at 120 Hz to minimize sampling artefacts in force determination. We used vertically aligned magnets coupled to an iron holder to achieve a force of up to 5 pN.</p><p>DNA was diluted and mixed in ParB-Mg<sup>2+</sup> buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 100 mM NaCl, 0.2 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> BSA, 0.1% Tween-20, 1 mM DTT, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) or ParB-EDTA buffer (by replacing the 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> with 1 mM EDTA) and then incubated with 1 μm diameter magnetic beads (Dynabeads, Myone Streptavidin, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 10 min. Magnetic beads were previously washed three times and diluted in PBS. DNA:beads ratios were adjusted for each substrate to obtain single tethered beads. Following DNA-beads incubation, then sample was injected in a double PARAFILM (Sigma)-layer flow cell. After 10 min adsorption of the beads to the surface, we applied a force of 4 pN to remove the non-attached beads and washed with buffer to clean the chamber. Torsionally constrained molecules and beads with more than a single DNA molecule were identified from its distinct rotation-extension curves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gutierrez-Escribano et al., 2020</xref>) and discarded for further analysis.</p><p>Time course data was obtained by recording the extension of the tether at a low force of 0.33 pN, after a 2 min incubation of DNA tethers and ParB at 4 pN. MT experiments using the EcoRI roadblocks include an initial step of incubation with 200 nM EcorRI<sup>E111G</sup> for 10 min at 4 pN. To obtain force-extension curves, we measured the extension of the tethers at decreasing forces from 5 to 0.01 pN for a total measuring time of around 15 min. Force-extension curves were first measured on naked DNA (no ParB data) and always from high to low force. Then, the experiment was repeated on the same molecule but at quoted ParB<sub>2</sub> concentrations. This method allowed us to obtain force-extension curves in the absence and presence of protein for each tethered DNA molecule. No ParB DNA curves were fitted to the worm-like chain model using Origin Software. Molecules with a discrepancy of contour length of ±15% from the crystallographic length were discarded for the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>C-trap fluorescence experiments</title><p>We used a dual optical tweezers setup combined with confocal microscopy and microfluidics (C-trap) from Lumicks (Lumicks B.V.). Our system has three laser lines (488, 532, 535 nm) for confocal microscopy and provides a force resolution of &lt;0.1 pN at 100 Hz, distance resolution of &lt;0.3 nm at 100 Hz, and confocal scanning with &lt; 1 nm spot positioning accuracy (Lumicks). In this work, we used a 488 nm laser for illumination and a 500–525 nm filter for its fluorescence. We used a five-channel microfluidic chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Channel 1 contained 4.38 µm SPHERO streptavidin-coated polystyrene beads diluted at 0.005% w/v in fishing buffer (FB, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, and 50 mM NaCl). Channel 2 included the 39× <italic>parS</italic> DNA in FB and channel 3 only FB. First, two beads were trapped using the dual optical tweezers in channel 1 and moved to channel 2 to attach DNA molecules to the beads. The capture of DNA was detected by performing a preliminary force-extension curve in channel 2. Then, the bead-DNA system was moved to channel 3, where further force-extension curves were performed to check for single-molecule captures and to define the zero force point. Finally, a stretching force of 19–23 pN was set, and the bead-DNA system moved to the protein channel 4 that contains ParB<sub>2</sub><sup>AF488</sup> at quoted concentrations in ParB-Mg<sup>2+</sup> buffer supplemented with an oxygen scavenger system (1 mM Trolox, 20 mM glucose, 8 µg ml<sup>−1</sup> glucose oxidase, and 20 µg ml<sup>−1</sup> catalase). Confocal images (scans) and kymographs were performed in the protein channel 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which was previously passivated with BSA (0.1% w/v in PBS) and Pluronic F128 (0.5% w/v in PBS).</p><p>Spreading experiments include a 2 min incubation time in channel 4 before turning on the confocal laser. Spreading-blocking experiments also used four channels but in this case we inject 100 nM EcoRI<sup>E111G</sup> in ParB buffer in channel 3. Following a 2 min incubation in channel 3 to allow binding of the blocking protein, the bead-DNA system was moved to channel 4, which in this case contained 100 nM EcoRI<sup>E111G</sup> and 20 nM ParB<sub>2</sub><sup>AF488</sup> in ParB buffer supplemented with the oxygen scavenger (see above). An additional 2 min incubation was performed before confocal imaging.</p><p>Confocal images of a defined area were taken using a pixel size of 100 nm and a scan velocity of 1 µm ms<sup>−1</sup>.

Using fluorescence visualization the authors were directly visualizing ParB-binding to ParS as well as the diffusive spreading of the protein along the DNA. They furthermore systematically and comprehensively probed under which conditions ParB-mediated DNA condensation was obtained that is considered to be essential for the chromosome segregation. The data of the authors convincingly shows that CTP binding by ParB stimulates its association with ParS and most importantly promotes its diffusive spreading from ParS. Diffusive spreading along the DNA contour was demonstrated using protein roadblocks. This provides sufficient evidence for protein diffusion along the DNA contour, although the authors did not achieve to visualize the diffusion of single ParB complexes along DNA directly. By testing a broad range of conditions (ParB concentration, presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, hydrolyzable and non-CTP, number of ParS sites), the authors demonstrated that CTP binding rather than hydolysis is sufficient for ParB to promote DNA condensation. The two different types of observation show together that the CTP-mediated diffusive spreading of ParB from ParS drives the downstream DNA condensation. Moreover, the nanomechanical DNA condensation experiments together with the combined direct fluorescent visualization represent a helpful methodological development for future studies of this system.

The work follows up on the recent discovery of ParB's ability to bind and hydrolyze CTP. The authors show that CTP addition stimulates ParB binding to DNA molecules harboring clustered parS sites and promotes the spreading of ParB onto neighboring DNA. Moreover, ParB binding is shown to lead to the condensation of DNA with clustered parS sites, again an activity that is stimulated by CTP or the non-hydrolysable analog CTPgS.</p><p>While the work carefully observes and describes ParB activity in vitro and reports findings that are largely consistent with recent publications, a potential weakness of the study concerns the use of artificially clustered parS sites on the DNA test substrates and the absence of similar activity on more natural substrates with a single parS site, together raising doubts about the physiological relevance of the discoveries.</p><p>parS sites are widely dispersed on the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> genome (10 sites in ~1 Mb) with the two closest sites being separated by about 10 kb. Moreover, a single parS site is sufficient to support chromosome segregation and to promote normal ParB focus formation. Clearly, parS site clustering is not crucial in vivo. Yet, the activities detected in this work appear strictly dependent on parS clustering. It is thus not clear whether DNA condensation by ParB as described here is indeed occurring in vivo and if it is relevant for ParB function.</p><p>A related preprint (Taylor et al., 2021) has reported similar DNA condensation using F plasmid ParB. In this case however clustered parS sites are naturally found on the corresponding DNA, the F plasmid. DNA condensation has thus only been observed with clustered parS sites. This should be discussed and further investigated.</p><p>The authors claim that they can directly detect binding of ParB to parS ('first visualization of the specific binding of ParB to parS'). However, their assay does not discriminate between parS-bound ParB and 1D diffusing ParB. This issue is particularly important as recent studies have actually suggested that ParB only transiently binds parS during the CTP hydrolysis cycle (Jalal et al., 2020; Soh et al., 2019). Can the authors discriminate parS binding and sliding by using a single parS site and EcoRI roadblocks?</p><p>ParB-AF488 displays severely compromised CTPase activity (figure supplement 1). Is this due to the cysteine mutation or due to the fluorescent label? The results need to be confirmed using a differently labeled protein (different cysteine or different fluorophore depending on what causes the reduced activity).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>ParBs bind to a centromere site called parS to form large condensed complexes at which ParBs are observed to spread many bp away from parS, but the mechanisms of spreading are under debate. The current study is based on recent discoveries that ParBs bind and hydrolyse CTP, and that CTP promotes spreading. Here the authors directly visualize fluorescent ParBs bound to parS on DNA that is stretched out because it is tethered at both ends. They examine the condensation using magnetic tweezers on DNA tethered at one end and pulled by a magnet at the other end. They find that CTP does promote parS-specific DNA binding and spreading, and this activity requires CTP but not hydrolysis. The results extend their previous published analyses in the absence of CTP, in which the authors observed spreading but it was not parS-specific and required higher ParB concentrations. Their results recapitulate many of the properties of spreading that have been observed in vivo, including specificity for parS and the influence of roadblocks. The results are consistent with a model proposed by Soh et al. (2019) in which CTP locks ParB as a clamp around DNA by promoting N-terminal domain self association, and that once clamped, it slides along the DNA away from parS; that is, sliding is proposed to be the mechanism of spreading. The results however are also consistent with spreading by cooperative interactions of ParBs with those bound next to them, so these data do not directly support sliding by ruling out other alternatives. Since this distinction is not resolved by the current results, one could look at these results as confirmatory. However there is important value to these results. As the authors state, this is the first time ParB molecule binding on linear DNA at and around parS has been directly visualized in single molecule studies; that is, with resolution for parS vs closely surrounding regions. The ability to view the complexes directly at this resolution on the DNA directly tests ParB/parS localization and the influence of spreading roadblocks. Second, the specificity for parS (or lack thereof) has long been a problem for the in vitro study of ParB binding to parS in biophysical experiments. Also, the authors show that sliding still prefers to reside close to the parS region (it is not &quot;free&quot;), suggesting that lateral (and perhaps bridging) protein-protein interactions play roles in complex architecture.</p><p>1. Figure 2G: The appropriate control is the same experiment omitting EcoRI, which should be included. Otherwise we are forced to compare different DNA substrates with this one and from previous figures.</p><p>2. Page 7 top: &quot;suggests that it occurs by sliding from parS&quot;. Although the authors clearly favor the sliding clamp model (as do I), their data do not address whether sliding or lateral protein-protein recruitment is responsible for spreading in these experiments. The key difference is whether the ParB molecules that have spread to neighboring DNA were loaded at parS or just next to other ParBs in what they call &quot;short-range spreading&quot;. Roadblocks also are consistent with sliding but other models can accommodate them also.</p><p>3. Page 2 and elsewhere: &quot;an absolute requirement for CTP binding but not hydrolysis&quot;. The authors did not test CDP, although Soh et al. showed that CDP does promote similar N-terminal self association that is promoted by CTP. This is an important part of the model; whether CDP works or whether the protein must be in an apo form to dissociate from DNA. Have the authors tested CDP? If yes, these data could be included. If not, CDP should be discussed.</p><p>4. Figure 1-S1C: the right 3 bars look mislabeled because they are identical to the middle 3 bars as labeled. Are they with CTPgS?</p><p>5.

Using optical tweezers, they show the specific binding of ParB to parS sites, and demonstrate that this process is enhanced by the presence of CTP or CTPγS. They find that lower density ParB proteins are also detected in distal non-specific DNA in the presence of parS, and that ParB spreading is restricted by protein roadblocks. Furthermore, using magnetic tweezers, they show that parS-containing DNA molecules are condensed by ParB at nanomolar protein concentration, which requires CTP binding but not hydrolysis. These finding show the significance of CTP-dependent ParB spreading and impact the understanding of the mechanism of DNA bridging and condensation by ParB networks.</p><p>Based on these results, the authors propose a model for ParB-mediated DNA condensation, which requires one-dimensional ParB sliding along DNA from parS sites. Overall, the experiments were carefully done and thoroughly controlled. The manuscript provides critical insights that can be strengthened by addressing the following concerns:</p><p>1. Did the authors observe the diffusion of isolated ParB foci along DNA? This will provide strong evidence for the proposed diffusion/sliding model.</p><p>2. Based on the sliding clamp model, ParB spreading and diffusion result in DNA condensation by forming large DNA loops. Is it possible to show the dynamic spreading of ParB while keep the same numbers of ParB on DNA? For example, can the authors incubate ParB-containing DNA in channel 4 (ParB channel) at a certain time for the loading of ParB on parS sites, and then move it to the buffer channel without free ParB as well as with CTP or CTPγS, where the images are acquired at the long interval time to minimize the photobleaching. The fluorescent intensity of the ParB during the spreading process can be analyzed. If the intensity remains constant through spreading in the presence of CTPγS but significantly decrease in the presence of CTP, this data will strongly demonstrate the proposed spreading and CTP hydrolysis-dependent dissociation mechanism.</p><p>3. In Figure 2, the authors show the spreading of ParB can be blocked by EcoRI. Can the authors show that EcoRI is bound at the specificity positions? The spreading blockage by protein roadblocks showed in optical tweezers experiments potentially hints that the roadblocks may affect the DNA condensation. Can the authors apply the magnetic tweezers to show the affection of protein roadblocks to DNA condensation in vitro?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67554.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>While the reviewers and the reviewing editor agreed that this is a very thorough, carefully done and important study, they identified a number of issues that need to be addressed:</p><p>1.

QD labelling increased the fluorescence intensity of a single ParB protein and allowed much longer visualization times due to the absence of photobleaching. We also fabricated substrates containing only 7 or 2 copies of parS to increase our chances of observing individual events. We succeeded in observing one-dimensional diffusion of individual ParB molecules along the DNA. Kymographs also showed a clear stable binding at parS sites confirming our previous findings. We developed new software to analyse these kymographs and extract individual ParB time-courses (i.e. ParB position along DNA versus time). Furthermore, we calculated diffusion constants for individual trajectories. The ParB diffusion constant was 0.41±0.02 μm2 s<sup>-1</sup> (mean±sem, n=177) or 3.5±0.2 kbp2 s<sup>-1</sup>, considering a rise per base pair of 0.34 nm. These data are consistent with previous single molecule experiments performed in the absence of CTP (Graham et al., 2014) and with the recently calculated ParB diffusion constant of 0.7 μm2 s<sup>-1</sup> using super-resolution microscopy (Guilhas et al., 2020).</p><p>These new data directly confirm our conclusion of ParB diffusion from parS sites.

We attribute this to the fact that these experiments are always done in the presence of a pulling force, which might be sufficient to prevent condensation if the condensation force is low. In order to test this hypothesis, we have now also performed experiments in the absence of pulling forces using the tethered particle motion (TPM) method and atomic force microscopy (AFM).</p><p>We first used TPM to determine RMS excursions of the bead, a parameter correlated with the contour length of the DNA.

The same experiment done without CTP, or with a scrambled parS DNA did not reduce RMS excursions. These experiments are included in a new Figure 6 supplement 1.</p><p>Additionally, we used AFM to image circular DNA molecules containing zero or one parS sites incubated under different experimental conditions. In the absence of CTP, DNA molecules and ParB proteins appeared monodispersed on the mica surface. In the presence of CTP and only when the single-parS DNA substrate was used, we observed clustering and condensation of DNA regions, presumably the parS region.

Of course, this model of condensation requires intermolecular interactions, which might come from the CTD or the NTD of ParB, but we do not see the necessity for proteins to be anchored at non-specific sites.

This reduction is not explained by errors in protein quantification due to the presence of the label, as spectroscopic and gel-based methods for estimating protein concentration are in good agreement (data not shown). It may be that a fraction of the protein is inactivated by the long labelling procedure (the reviewer is comparing labelled protein with untreated wild-type protein, rather than mock-labelled protein).</p><p>In any case, the apparent effect on CTPase and DNA binding is less than 2-fold (original paper and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>), and DNA binding stimulates the CTPase activity to the same extent as for wild type (original paper). These data suggest that labelling causes minimal disruption to the enzyme’s active sites. Therefore, we respectfully disagree that the activity of this protein is “severely compromised” by labelling. We do accept and acknowledge that the behavior is perturbed from wild type as is the case in many single molecule studies using fluorescently-labelled proteins.</p><p>Importantly, this small quantitative change in CTP turnover rate has no effect on our conclusions. Our work focuses on the <italic>large and qualitative</italic> effects of CTP on the protein’s behaviour, and these are consistent across experiments which use both labelled (C-trap) and unlabeled (MT, TPM, AFM) protein preparations. In all cases, we control for these CTP-dependent effects by performing the experiments in the absence of nucleotides or in the presence of non-hydrolysable analogues or CDP.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Representative TBM- and TBE-EMSAs assessing <italic>parS</italic> binding (A and B) and non-specific DNA-binding activity (C), respectively, of Alexa-488-labelled-ParB and its precursor, ParBS68C.</title><p>Wild-type-like specific and non-specific DNA-binding activity is retained.

The current study is based on recent discoveries that ParBs bind and hydrolyse CTP, and that CTP promotes spreading. Here the authors directly visualize fluorescent ParBs bound to parS on DNA that is stretched out because it is tethered at both ends. They examine the condensation using magnetic tweezers on DNA tethered at one end and pulled by a magnet at the other end. They find that CTP does promote parS-specific DNA binding and spreading, and this activity requires CTP but not hydrolysis. The results extend their previous published analyses in the absence of CTP, in which the authors observed spreading but it was not parS-specific and required higher ParB concentrations. Their results recapitulate many of the properties of spreading that have been observed in vivo, including specificity for parS and the influence of roadblocks. The results are consistent with a model proposed by Soh et al. (2019) in which CTP locks ParB as a clamp around DNA by promoting N-terminal domain self association, and that once clamped, it slides along the DNA away from parS; that is, sliding is proposed to be the mechanism of spreading. The results however are also consistent with spreading by cooperative interactions of ParBs with those bound next to them, so these data do not directly support sliding by ruling out other alternatives. Since this distinction is not resolved by the current results, one could look at these results as confirmatory. However there is important value to these results. As the authors state, this is the first time ParB molecule binding on linear DNA at and around parS has been directly visualized in single molecule studies; that is, with resolution for parS vs closely surrounding regions. The ability to view the complexes directly at this resolution on the DNA directly tests ParB/parS localization and the influence of spreading roadblocks. Second, the specificity for parS (or lack thereof) has long been a problem for the in vitro study of ParB binding to parS in biophysical experiments. Also, the authors show that sliding still prefers to reside close to the parS region (it is not &quot;free&quot;), suggesting that lateral (and perhaps bridging) protein-protein interactions play roles in complex architecture.</p><p>1.

Page 7 top: &quot;suggests that it occurs by sliding from parS&quot;. Although the authors clearly favor the sliding clamp model (as do I), their data do not address whether sliding or lateral protein-protein recruitment is responsible for spreading in these experiments. The key difference is whether the ParB molecules that have spread to neighboring DNA were loaded at parS or just next to other ParBs in what they call &quot;short-range spreading&quot;. Roadblocks also are consistent with sliding but other models can accommodate them also.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point, also raised by the other reviewers.

Page 2 and elsewhere: &quot;an absolute requirement for CTP binding but not hydrolysis&quot;. The authors did not test CDP, although Soh et al. showed that CDP does promote similar N-terminal self association that is promoted by CTP. This is an important part of the model; whether CDP works or whether the protein must be in an apo form to dissociate from DNA. Have the authors tested CDP? If yes, these data could be included. If not, CDP should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we performed C-trap and MT experiments using CDP. Our results showed ParB binding to parS at levels similar to the no-nucleotide condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>), and lack of diffusion from parS. As expected, no condensation of DNA was observed under CDP conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>). This confirms our conclusion that it is the binding of CTP and not the hydrolysis what enhances ParB binding to parS, and promotes ParB diffusion from parS and condensation.</p><fig id="sa2fig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>(left) C-trap scan showing ParB binding to <italic>parS</italic> at similar levels to the Apo-form of ParB, and not diffusion from <italic>parS</italic>.</title><p>(right) MT time-course showing absence of condensation in the presence of CDP and Mg<sup>2+</sup>.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-67554-resp-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We have included the fluorescence intensity profile corresponding to the CDP condition in Figure 2C.

Using optical tweezers, they show the specific binding of ParB to parS sites, and demonstrate that this process is enhanced by the presence of CTP or CTPγS. They find that lower density ParB proteins are also detected in distal non-specific DNA in the presence of parS, and that ParB spreading is restricted by protein roadblocks. Furthermore, using magnetic tweezers, they show that parS-containing DNA molecules are condensed by ParB at nanomolar protein concentration, which requires CTP binding but not hydrolysis. These finding show the significance of CTP-dependent ParB spreading and impact the understanding of the mechanism of DNA bridging and condensation by ParB networks.</p><p>Based on these results, the authors propose a model for ParB-mediated DNA condensation, which requires one-dimensional ParB sliding along DNA from parS sites. Overall, the experiments were carefully done and thoroughly controlled. The manuscript provides critical insights that can be strengthened by addressing the following concerns:</p><p>1. Did the authors observe the diffusion of isolated ParB foci along DNA? This will provide strong evidence for the proposed diffusion/sliding model.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point, also raised by the other reviewers. Please see our detailed answer to this query in the “essential revisions” section elaborated by the editor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Based on the sliding clamp model, ParB spreading and diffusion result in DNA condensation by forming large DNA loops. Is it possible to show the dynamic spreading of ParB while keep the same numbers of ParB on DNA? For example, can the authors incubate ParB-containing DNA in channel 4 (ParB channel) at a certain time for the loading of ParB on parS sites, and then move it to the buffer channel without free ParB as well as with CTP or CTPγS, where the images are acquired at the long interval time to minimize the photobleaching. The fluorescent intensity of the ParB during the spreading process can be analyzed. If the intensity remains constant through spreading in the presence of CTPγS but significantly decrease in the presence of CTP, this data will strongly demonstrate the proposed spreading and CTP hydrolysis-dependent dissociation mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these suggestions to prove spreading. However, we decided to follow an alternative strategy based on the direct imaging of QD-labelled ParB. As described above, this strategy worked well and we have directly visualized ParB diffusion from parS sites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In Figure 2, the authors show the spreading of ParB can be blocked by EcoRI. Can the authors show that EcoRI is bound at the specificity positions? The spreading blockage by protein roadblocks showed in optical tweezers experiments potentially hints that the roadblocks may affect the DNA condensation. Can the authors apply the magnetic tweezers to show the affection of protein roadblocks to DNA condensation in vitro?</p></disp-quote><p>It is well established that EcoRI has extremely high affinity and specificity for its site (Terry et al., 1983) and so, since we do not have labelled EcoRI mutant, our experiments assume the sites are occupied. This is one reason we have used multiple sites in our experiments. Nevertheless, we have tested the effect of protein roadblocks in condensation in MT experiments. We found partial concentration consistent with the blocking of spreading of ParB from parS (Figure 7-figure supplement 1).</p><p>References</p><p>Breier AM, Grossman AD. 2007.
