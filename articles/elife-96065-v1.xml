forms of leptospirosis accompanied by a dysregulated inflammatory response, which often results in death. The gut microbiota has been increasingly recognized as a vital element in systemic health. However, the precise role of the gut microbiota in severe leptospirosis is still unknown. Here, we aimed to explore the function and potential mechanisms of the gut microbiota in a hamster model of severe leptospirosis. Our study showed that leptospires were able to multiply in the intestine, cause pathological injury, and induce intestinal and systemic inflammatory responses. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis revealed that <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection changed the composition of the gut microbiota of hamsters with an expansion of Proteobacteria. In addition, gut barrier permeability was increased after infection, as reflected by a decrease in the expression of tight junctions. Translocated Proteobacteria were found in the intestinal epithelium of moribund hamsters, as determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization, with elevated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels in the serum. Moreover, gut microbiota depletion reduced the survival time, increased the leptospiral load, and promoted the expression of proinflammatory cytokines after <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection. Intriguingly, fecal filtration and serum from moribund hamsters both increased the transcription of <italic>TNF-α</italic>, <italic>IL-1β</italic>, <italic>IL-10</italic>, and <italic>TLR4</italic> in macrophages compared with those from uninfected hamsters. These stimulating activities were inhibited by LPS neutralization using polymyxin B. Based on our findings, we identified an LPS neutralization therapy that significantly improved the survival rates in severe leptospirosis when used in combination with antibiotic therapy or polyclonal antibody therapy. In conclusion, our study not only uncovers the role of the gut microbiota in severe leptospirosis but also provides a therapeutic strategy for severe leptospirosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Leptospira</italic></kwd><kwd>hamster</kwd><kwd>microbiota</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32172872</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Yongguo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32302879</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jiuxi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002858</institution-id><institution>China Postdoctoral Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BX20220131</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xie</surname><given-names>Xufeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100021171</institution-id><institution>Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022A1515110966</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jiuxi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Gut dysbiosis is involved in severe leptospirosis that is related to translocated microbiota-derived lipopolysaccharide.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Leptospirosis is a worldwide emerging zoonotic disease caused by <italic>Leptospira</italic> spp. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coburn et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>Leptospira interrogans</italic> impacts approximately 1 million people, resulting in 60,000 deaths every year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coburn et al., 2021</xref>). In human leptospirosis, the clinical manifestations can range from mild illness to multiorgan failure, characterized by jaundice, kidney, and liver failure, and even death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haake and Levett, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maia et al., 2022</xref>). Currently, one important challenge is that leptospirosis is often misdiagnosed as other febrile diseases, and once the optimal treatment period is missed, leptospirosis quickly develops into the severe form, which often ends in death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coutinho et al., 2014</xref>). However, antibiotic treatment is often useless in severe leptospirosis and even aggravates it, called the Jarisch–Herxheimer Reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guerrier and D’Ortenzio, 2013</xref>). Thus, it is imperative to explore precision medicine strategies for the treatment of severe leptospirosis.</p><p>Ninety percent of infected humans may resolve spontaneously while 10% of patients are designated as susceptible hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cagliero et al., 2018</xref>). Intestinal bleeding is a common but neglected symptom of severe leptospirosis in humans and hamster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alventosa Mateu, 2017</xref>). A healthy gut environment, shaped by the presence of a healthy functional microbial ecosystem, is fundamental to instruct the immune system toward homeostasis. The intestine harbors a densely populated resident microbial community, which consists of bacteria, viruses, and fungi, called microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kamada et al., 2013</xref>). Gut dysbiosis has been linked to increased susceptibility to disseminated bacterial infections and sepsis in humans. In addition, studies of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) have found that dysbiosis increases the risk of nosocomial infections, sepsis, and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McDonald et al., 2020</xref>). Our previous study proved that the gut microbiota contributed to the defense against <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection in mice, a resistant model of leptospirosis, without obvious intestinal lesions or increased intestinal permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xie et al., 2022</xref>), while diarrhea was a common symptom in the late leptospirosis of hamster. As is known, the gut microbiota is closely related to the homeostasis of the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2022</xref>). A previous study demonstrated that the variation of the gut microbiota mediated the different susceptibility to cholera infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alavi et al., 2020</xref>). Focusing on the role of the gut microbiota in leptospirosis may help explain the differences in susceptibility to <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection in humans and develop targeted therapy for acute leptospirosis. However, whether a relationship exists between the gut microbiota and severe leptospirosis is still unclear.</p><p>In this study, we used the hamster model of leptospirosis to explore the functional role of the gut microbiota in acute leptospirosis. We provide evidence that <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection disrupted intestinal homeostasis, and targeting gut-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) improved the survival rates of hamsters with severe leptospirosis. Our study provides a basis for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to control severe leptospirosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>L. interrogans</italic> proliferated in the intestine, impaired the intestinal structure, and induced proinflammatory response</title><p>Recently, Inamasu et al. reported that subcutaneous infection with leptospires led to intestinal dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Inamasu et al., 2022</xref>). We wondered whether different challenge routes affected the dissemination of <italic>Leptospira</italic> into the intestine. Thus, we compared the common intraperitoneal challenge with subcutaneous challenge in a hamster model of leptospirosis. Our study indicated that subcutaneous challenge and intraperitoneal challenge both led to leptospiral proliferation in the ileum and colon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). There were approximately seven times more leptospires in the colon than in the ileums at articulo mortis (AM) post infection (p.i.) after intraperitoneal challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Hamsters infected by intraperitoneal challenge had shortened survival time compared with hamsters infected by subcutaneous challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). <italic>L. interrogans</italic> infection disrupted the intestinal structure, caused bleeding, and led to the infiltration of inflammatory cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition, <italic>L. interrogans</italic> infection promoted the inflammatory response in the colons as determined by the upregulated gene expression of <italic>lipocalin 2</italic> (<italic>Lcn2</italic>)/<italic>neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin</italic> (<italic>NGAL</italic>), a marker of intestinal inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kitamoto et al., 2020</xref>), <italic>TNF-α</italic>, <italic>IL-1β</italic>, <italic>Nos2</italic>, and <italic>TLR4</italic> (a well-known receptor of LPS that is vital against <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Viriyakosol et al., 2006</xref>] and the downregulated gene expression of <italic>IL-10)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–I</xref>). We wondered whether proinflammatory gene expression was also related to other TLRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aldape et al., 2010</xref>). The results showed that the gene expression of <italic>TLR2</italic> and <italic>TLR9</italic> was significantly increased, while <italic>TLR3</italic>, <italic>TLR5</italic>, and <italic>TLR7</italic> showed no obvious difference in the AM group compared with the D0 group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–E</xref>). It is well known that <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection can cause leptospiremia and cytokine storms at late stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cagliero et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Limothai et al., 2021</xref>). Our results also proved that the gene expression of <italic>TNF-α</italic>, <italic>IL-1β</italic>, and <italic>IL-10</italic> was increased in the blood of the AM group compared with that of the D0 group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F–H</xref>).

The results showed that the composition of the gut microbiota in the AM group was significantly different from that in the D0 group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). There was a large degree of dispersion among different individuals 2 d p.i.

Their study highlighted that not only the urine of infected animals but also the feces could be a source of infection. However, the exact role of the gut microenvironment in the pathogenesis of leptospirosis is still unknown. In our study, we found that leptospires could proliferate in the ileum and colon following intraperitoneal challenge or subcutaneous challenge, which was consistent with the results of Inamasu’s study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Inamasu et al., 2022</xref>). Hamsters infected intraperitoneally exhibited more rapid death than hamsters infected subcutaneously. A previous study reported that the route of infection affected the kinetics of hematogenous dissemination, kidney colonization, and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maruoka et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, the subcutaneous route induced a slower-progressing infection than the intraperitoneal route in a leptospirosis rat model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zilber et al., 2016</xref>). However, there was a higher leptospiral load in the colons than in the ileums of hamsters infected by the intraperitoneal route. The capacity of <italic>L. interrogans</italic> to breach the immune defense at each port of entry is determined when <italic>Leptospira</italic> gained access to the blood. Although intraperitoneal challenge may be not a natural route of infection, both intraperitoneal challenge and subcutaneous challenge led to the colonization of leptospires in the intestine, indicating that leptospiral colonization in the intestine was independent of the routine of infection. <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection destroyed the intestinal structure and induced intestinal inflammation in the colon. However, Inamasu et al. reported that <italic>Leptospira</italic> was not involved in the pathogenesis of the colon, suggesting that the jejunum and ileum are the main sites of lesions. Differences in bacterial strains and the route of infection might lead to variations in results. Infection via the intraperitoneal and subcutaneous routes bypasses the epidermal defense system. Early damage to the intestinal structure and environment may be one of the causes of rapid death following infection by intraperitoneal injection. The proliferation of leptospires in the intestine makes feces a potential excretion route. Our previous study demonstrated that leptospires were rapidly cleared in the intestine and that <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection did not increase the intestinal permeability of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xie et al., 2022</xref>). A recent study reported that pathogenic <italic>Leptospira</italic> spp. were highly present in human and gorilla stool samples in the Congo but were absent in other African nonhuman primates, thereby suggesting a possible gorilla–humans transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Medkour et al., 2021</xref>). Our 16S rRNA sequencing results also showed that the relative abundance of Spirochetes was increased in the AM group compared with that of the D0 group, which might be related to the excretion of leptospires in the feces. However, no leptospires were detected in the feces of <italic>Leptospira</italic>-infected rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zilber et al., 2016</xref>). Serovar specificity and species differences may determine the excretion route of leptospires and the disruption of intestinal homeostasis may influence the progression of leptospirosis.</p><p>Our 16S rRNA sequencing results showed that the species richness and diversity of the gut microbiota in the AM group were even higher than those in the D2 group. The species richness and diversity of the gut microbiota decreased first and then increased with disease progression. This phenomenon was also reported in melioidosis and HIV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lankelma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lozupone et al., 2013</xref>). Lankelma et al. explained that several ‘big players’ in the gut microbiota were eliminated by the host immune system during severe systemic bacterial infection, giving way to the proliferation of other bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lankelma et al., 2017</xref>). Specific microbiota community composition, rather than species richness, drives microbiota-mediated resistance against <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection. Becattini et al. demonstrated that microbiota composition and the type of immune stimulus impacted bacterial responses and that the intestinal metabolome was rapidly reshaped by host immune activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becattini et al., 2021</xref>). We hypothesized that the early colonization and proliferation of leptospires in the intestine rapidly activated intestinal immunity, leading to the expansion of specific microbes in the AM group. The composition of the gut microbiota in the D2 group was discrete, as shown by PCoA. This difference might be related to the disease progression. In addition, we found that the levels of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and <italic>Allobaculum</italic> were higher in the D0 group than that in the AM group at the genus level. Meanwhile, the level of Proteobacteria increased in the AM group. A previous study demonstrated that pretreatment with <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> prevented severe pathogenesis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Potula et al., 2017</xref>), which highlighted the <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> as candidate for leptospirosis prevention. Our study proved that <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection increased the gene expression of <italic>TLR2</italic>, <italic>TLR4</italic>, <italic>TLR9</italic>, and some proinflammatory cytokines, which created a proinflammatory environment in the intestine. A previous study demonstrated that intestinal inflammation increased the bioavailability of respiratory electron acceptors for Enterobacteriaceae, which promoted the expansion of pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Byndloss et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, it is plausible that <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection triggered intestinal inflammation, which promoted the expansion of Proteobacteria by increasing the bioavailability of respiratory electron acceptors for pathogenic Proteobacteria.</p><p>The intestinal barrier is critical for maintaining homeostasis in the host. The apical junctional complex (AJC) encircles pairs of neighboring epithelial and endothelial cells to create an adhesive network and maintain barrier integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rusu and Georgiou, 2020</xref>). Our results showed that <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection significantly disrupted the intestinal permeability of hamsters at the late stage of infection. Previous studies have demonstrated that <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection reduced the signaling between cell–cell junction proteins and caused the mislocalization of AJC proteins, such as occludin and Zo-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sebastián et al., 2021</xref>). A recent study reported that <italic>L. interrogans</italic> could disassemble AJCs in renal proximal tubule epithelial cells and transmigrate through the paracellular route for dissemination in the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sebastián et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that <italic>L. interrogans</italic> was also able to transmigrate through the intestinal epithelial barrier, and feces excretion route of leptospires was possible in susceptible hosts during leptospirosis. Our results showed that the gene expression of <italic>Claudin-2</italic>, <italic>Claudin-3</italic>, <italic>Claudin-4</italic>, <italic>Zo-1,</italic> and <italic>Mucin-2</italic> was compensatively upregulated in the D2 group compared with those in the D0 group. However, the gene expression of <italic>Claudin-3</italic>, <italic>JAMA</italic>, <italic>Zo-1,</italic> and <italic>Mucin-2</italic> was downregulated in the AM group compared with that in the D0 group. In contrast, the gene expression of <italic>Claudin-2</italic> was higher in the AM group than that in the D0 group, which might explain why moribund hamsters had diarrhea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tsai et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Gut microbiota-depleted hamsters exhibited reduced survival time, increased leptospiral load, and upregulated gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines compared with untreated hamsters after <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection, while FMT partially reversed these effects. Our previous study demonstrated that the leptospiral load was increased in the organs of gut microbiota-depleted mice and that gut microbiota depletion diminished the bactericidal activity of macrophages during <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xie et al., 2022</xref>). These results indicated that the homeostasis of the gut microbiota is essential for both susceptible and resistant hosts to combat <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection. 16S rRNA sequencing analysis revealed that antibiotic treatment decreased the diversity of the gut microbiota, and FMT partially reversed these changes. Antibiotic treatment increased the relative abundance of proinflammatory bacteria, such as γ-Proteobacteria, while it reduced the relative abundance of anti-inflammatory bacteria, such as <italic>Allobaculum</italic>. The alteration of the gut microbiota might skew the host to an inflammatory condition and reduce antileptospiral capacity. FMT aims to replace an unfavorable resident gut microbiota with a favorable microbiota from a healthy donor. FMT has demonstrated clear efficacy in the treatment of recurrent <italic>Clostridioides difficile</italic> infection (rCDI), inflammatory bowel disease, and neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schmidt et al., 2022</xref>). The efficiency of FMT determines the phenotypes of subjects in the infection model. Prolonging the duration of FMT might help recover the gut microbiota homeostasis and the capacity to combat anti-<italic>Leptospira</italic> infection.</p><p>Our study showed the translocation of Proteobacteria to the intestinal epithelium. Although no bacteria were found in the blood of the AM group, the level of LPS was increased in the PBS-treated AM group compared with that of the uninfected group, and it was decreased in the Abx-treated AM group compared with that of the PBS-treated AM group. This result indicated that gut-derived LPS was involved in severe leptospirosis. Gut dysbiosis is a primary determinant of low-grade endotoxemia mediated by dysfunction of the intestinal barrier scaffold, which is a prerequisite for LPS translocation into the systemic circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Violi et al., 2023</xref>). Importantly, mice (resistant to leptospirosis) can tolerate levels of LPS endotoxin 250 higher than the level that humans can tolerate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Copeland et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, classical Gram-negative LPS had a 1000-fold higher potency than leptospiral LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Werts et al., 2001</xref>). Fecal filtration from the AM group and the uninfected group both increased the gene expression of <italic>TLR4</italic>, while only serum from the AM group increased the gene expression of <italic>TLR4</italic>. TLR4 expression was inhibited by PMB treatment. In severe leptospirosis, excessive immune activation is a hallmark of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cagliero et al., 2018</xref>). A previous study demonstrated that the cytokine response to heat-killed whole leptospires was not inhibited by PMB in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Viriyakosol et al., 2006</xref>). Leptospiral LPS has been described as atypical in terms of structure, and silver-stained electrophoretic profiles of LPS from pathogenic leptospiral strains were shown to be different from those of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonhomme et al., 2020</xref>). Although it is still difficult to distinguish the specific roles of gut-derived LPS and leptospiral LPS in promoting inflammation, we hypothesize that gut-derived LPS may also be an essential driver of inflammatory reactions in severe leptospirosis. In a rat cirrhosis model, gut decontamination with a 2-week course of antibiotics led to a redistributed microbiota, reduced proinflammatory activation of mucosal immune cells, and diminished gut bacterial translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Muñoz et al., 2019</xref>). Another study showed that endogenous endotoxins caused a pan enteric inflammatory ileus after colonic surgery and that gut decontamination alleviated small intestinal muscularis inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Türler et al., 2007</xref>). Our results showed that doxycycline treatment significantly reduced the leptospiral load in the blood in severe leptospirosis; however, the gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines was upregulated, which was consistent with the Jarisch–Herxheimer Reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guerrier and D’Ortenzio, 2013</xref>). Recently, Li et al. proposed an all-in-one drug delivery strategy equipped with bactericidal, LPS neutralization, and detoxification activities to treat sepsis-associated infections and hyperinflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2023</xref>). Our study also highlighted the important role of endogenous gut-derived LPS induced by <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection. Thus, the neutralization of gut-derived LPS and antileptospiral therapy are both essential in the treatment of severe leptospirosis; thus, these strategies provide a novel avenue for the treatment of human acute leptospirosis in the future.</p><p>Our study has potentially important clinical implications for the care of critically ill patients with severe leptospirosis. In human infections, gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea have been frequently observed, which has been linked to an increased risk of organ dysfunction, and even death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haake and Levett, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiménez et al., 2018</xref>). Our findings implicate impairment of the intestinal barrier by <italic>Leptospira</italic> infection as a mechanism underlying the association between gut dysbiosis and disseminated gut-derived LPS in the ICU. More importantly, from a translational perspective, our findings suggest that the increased risk of death in severe leptospirosis can be reduced by LPS neutralization combined with anti-<italic>Leptospira</italic> therapy. In fact, gut microbiota dysbiosis in COVID-19 patients or HIV infection is also associated with microbial translocation, LPS biosynthesis, and an expansion of Proteobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernard-Raichon et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). The application of LPS antagonist therapies, whether microbial or pharmaceutical, may be a viable precision medicine strategy to increase the survival rate of patients with severe leptospirosis or other gut-damaging infections by protecting against the spread of LPS in the bloodstream.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>A previous study reported that sex influenced host susceptibility to leptospirosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gomes et al., 2018</xref>) and that sex may affect the composition of the gut microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vemuri et al., 2019</xref>).

All PCRs were carried out with TransStart FastPfu DNA Polymerase (TransGen Biotech). PCR products were purified using the QIAGEN Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN, Germany). Sequencing libraries were generated using the SMRTbell Template Prep Kit (PacBio) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. The library quality was assessed on the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Scientific) and FEMTO Pulse system. Finally, the library was sequenced on the PacBio Sequel platform. Raw sequences were initially processed through the PacBio SMRT portal. Sequences were filtered for a minimum of three passes, and a minimum predicted accuracy of 90% (minfullpass = 3, minPredictedAccuacy = 0.9). The predicted accuracy was 90%, which was defined as the threshold below which CCS was considered noise. The files generated by the PacBio platform were then used for amplicon size trimming to remove sequences outside the expected amplicon size (minLength 1340 bp, maxLength 1640 bp). The reads were assigned to samples based on their unique barcode and trimmed by removing the barcode and primer sequence. The reads were compared with the reference database using the UCHIME algorithm to detect chimeric sequences, and then the chimeric sequences were removed to obtain clean reads. Alpha diversity (Chao1 and Shannon) was calculated with QIIME (version 1.9.1) and displayed with R software (version 2.15.3). PCoA was performed to obtain principal coordinates and visualize the complex, multidimensional data. A distance matrix of weighted UniFrac among samples obtained before was transformed to a new set of orthogonal axes by which the maximum variation factor was demonstrated by the first principal coordinate, and the second maximum variation factor was demonstrated by the second principal coordinate. PCoA results were displayed using the WGCNA package, stat packages, and ggplot2 package in R software (version 2.15.3).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Survival differences between the study groups were compared by using the Kaplan–Meier log-rank test.

To examine the role of the gut microbiota on acute leptospirosis, the infective doses of leptospires was chosen for 106, while in other sections of the study, the infective doses of leptospires was chosen for 107. In fact, we also used 107 leptospires to infect hamsters, however, the infective doses of 107 leptospires might be overdose, there was no significant difference on the survival rate between the control group and the Abx-treated group. A previous study also highlighted that the infective doses of leptospires was important in the investigating the sex on leptospirosis, as male hamsters infected with L. interrogans are more susceptible to severe leptospirosis after exposure to lower infectious doses than females (103 leptospires but not 104 leptospires) (1).</p><p>Reference</p><p>(1) GOMES C K, GUEDES M, POTULA H H, et al.

Yes, LPS neutralization is not a new method for treating leptospiral infection, most of which might focus on leptospiral LPS. In addition, Leptospira seemed to be naturally resistant to polymyxin B (1). Recently, neutralizing gut-derived LPS was applied in other diseases which significantly relieved diseases (2-3). In this study, we found that Leptospira infection promoted an expansion of Proteobacteria, increased gut barrier permeability, and elevated LPS levels in the serum. Thus, we proposed an LPS-neutralization therapy which improved the survival rate of moribund hamsters combined with antibody therapy or antibiotic therapy.</p><p>Reference</p><p>(1) LIEGEON G, DELORY T, PICARDEAU M.
