majority of human tumors and confer aggressive tumor phenotypes, including metastasis and therapy resistance. CB002 and structural-analogs restore p53 signaling in tumors with mutant-p53 but we find that unlike other xanthines such as caffeine, pentoxifylline, and theophylline, they do not deregulate the G2 checkpoint. Novel CB002-analogs induce pro-apoptotic Noxa protein in an ATF3/4-dependent manner, whereas caffeine, pentoxifylline, and theophylline do not. By contrast to caffeine, CB002-analogs target an S-phase checkpoint associated with increased p-RPA/RPA2, p-ATR, decreased Cyclin A, p-histone H3 expression, and downregulation of essential proteins in DNA-synthesis and DNA-repair. CB002-analog #4 enhances cell death, and decreases Ki-67 in patient-derived tumor-organoids without toxicity to normal human cells. Preliminary in vivo studies demonstrate anti-tumor efficacy in mice. Thus, a novel class of anti-cancer drugs shows the activation of p53 pathway signaling in tumors with mutated p53, and targets an S-phase checkpoint.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>p53</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>therapy</kwd><kwd>xanthines</kwd><kwd>CB002</kwd><kwd>noxa</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000043</institution-id><institution>American Association for Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Minority Scholar Research Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hernandez Borrero</surname><given-names>Liz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA176289</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>El-Deiry</surname><given-names>Wafik S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>El-Deiry</surname><given-names>Wafik S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Teymour Alireza P'98, P'00 Family Cancer Research Fund established by the Alireza Family</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>El-Deiry</surname><given-names>Wafik S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Anti-tumor properties of sub-class of xanthine analogs involve restoration of p53 pathway transcriptome, independent of p53/p73, dependent on ATF3/ATF4 and Noxa in mutated-p53 tumors and the compounds trigger an S-phase checkpoint.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tumor suppressor p53 responds to cell stress signals from DNA damage, oncogene activation, oxidative stress, and hypoxia. Upon activation by posttranslational modifications and oligomerization, p53 signals cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, or DNA repair, according to the extent of the cellular stress, thereby controlling cell fate and preventing tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Riley et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, it is not surprising that <italic>TP53</italic> is the most commonly mutated gene (TCGA, 2020), including in ovarian, colorectal, esophageal, head and neck, lung, and pancreatic cancers that are the most affected sporadic human cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Olivier et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>TP53</italic> is mutated in over 50% of human cancers and the other 50% involve a biological inactivation of its signaling pathway. Like other tumor suppressors, the mutated p53 protein results in loss-of-function but oligomerization can act in a dominant-negative fashion with regard to theÂ remaining wild-type p53 allele. Unlike other tumor suppressors, mutant p53 protein can also acquire a gain-of-function which contributes to aggressive tumor phenotypes, including enhanced invasion, genomic instability, and therapy resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Muller and Vousden, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dittmer et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Xu et al., 2011</xref>). Consequently, patients whose tumors carry p53 mutations have a poor prognosis and decreased overall survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wattel et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>A common feature of cancer cells is genomic instability due to ineffective cell cycle checkpoint responses. Genomic instability is not necessarily due to defective checkpoints. The checkpoints may be intact but the repair may be deficient. Upon DNA damage, the normal cell cycle checkpoint response is to arrest the cell at the G1-phase. In cancer cells, the majority have an ineffective G1Â checkpoint due to p53 mutation but retain a functional G2Â checkpoint and thus have the ability to undergo cell arrest at the G2-phase. Cancer cells depend on bypassing intra-S-phase and G2/M checkpoints for unrestrained cell proliferation. Stress signal transduction in the p53 pathway is initiated by activation of kinases ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM), ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3Â (ATR)-related, and downstream checkpoint kinases Chk1/2 that serve as signaling sensors and mediators of p53 activation. It has been a long-standing dogma that ATM/Chk2 and ATR/Chk1 are independently activated but recent studies provide evidence of cross-talk between the kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown and Baltimore, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Smith et al., 2010</xref>). Chk1/2 are kinases that participate in cell cycle checkpoint control, with Chk1 being active in S-phase and G2-phase, whereas Chk2 is active throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Smith et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zhao and Piwnica-Worms, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chehab et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Accumulation of genomic aberrations over time renders cancer cells vulnerable to checkpoint targeting therapy. Since the discovery of checkpoint targets, small molecule inhibitors have been pursued in combination with ionizing radiation and chemotherapy agents in order to deregulate checkpoints, thereby leading to cancer cell death. For example, combination of caffeine, a xanthine derivative, with irradiation or chemotherapy agents was found to deregulate the G2Â checkpoint through ATM/ATR inhibition leading to therapy sensitization and enhanced cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Russell et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Sarkaria et al., 1999</xref>). Nonetheless, translational cancer therapeutics studies were discontinued due to unachievable active concentrations in human plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lelo et al., 1986</xref>). Thus, for the past two decades, the field has focused on the development of Chk1/2 inhibitors, which are in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fracasso et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Rogers et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Another cancer therapeutic approach we and others have pursued involves restoration of p53 pathway signaling in tumors with mutant p53 or tumors that are null for p53. Despite efforts to restore the p53-pathway, to date, there are no FDA-approved drugs that functionally restore the p53 in tumors with mutated p53. We previously reported a p53-pathway restoring compound CB002 whose mechanism of action was not fully elucidated. We showed that CB002 leads to apoptotic cell death mediated by p53 target Noxa, a pro-apoptotic protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hernandez-Borrero et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we further evaluated more potent CB002-analog compounds and uncovered a unique mechanism of action suggestive of a novel class of anti-cancer drugs. Based on their molecular structure as xanthine derivatives, the novel class of CB002-analogs, unlike caffeine and other established xanthine derivatives, do not deregulate the G2Â checkpoint. By contrast, the novel CB002-analog xanthines perturb S-phase and more importantly they restore the p53-pathway, a property not found with caffeine, pentoxifylline, and theophylline. We sought to characterize and define the new class of small molecules with anti-tumor propertiesÂ by transcriptomic and proteomic analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CB002 and structural analogs restore the p53 pathway independently of p53, while xanthines such as caffeine, pentoxifylline, and theophylline do not</title><p>We sought to identify more potent analogs of parental xanthine compound CB002. We tested CB002-analogs in the ChemBridge library for the capability to induce the luciferase activity using a p53-regulated luciferase reporter stably expressed in the SW480 colorectal cancer cell line and also determined the IC50 values for the compounds by a CellTiter glow cytotoxicity assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1AâB</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The majority of the CB002-analogs tested, with the exception of analog #12, enhanced p53-reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner within a range of compound concentrations from 0 to 600 Î¼M. We investigated the capability of a set of the CB002-analogs to induce apoptosis as indicated by Propidium Iodide (PI) staining sub-G1 population. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, theÂ treatment of tumor cells with CB002-analogs at an IC50 concentration (100 Î¼M) resulted in a significant increase in sub-G1 content in SW480 cells. Moreover, the most potent CB002-analog #4 was found to increase cleaved-PARP and cytochrome C release from the mitochondria to the cytosol providing further evidence for apoptosis induction in SW480 tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1DâE</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>).

Our previously published CB002 data indicated that Noxa plays a key role in mediating CB002-induced apoptosis (19). Thus, we sought to determine if CB002-analogs induce Noxa expression in four human colorectal cancer cell lines. In DLD-1 (p53<sup>S241F</sup>), SW480(p53<sup>R273H,P309S</sup>), HCT116(p53<sup>WT</sup>), and HCT116 p53â<sup>/â</sup>Â tumor cells expressing the exogenous R175H p53 mutant, Noxa protein expression was found to be induced, though some variation across cell lines was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). As these CB002-analogs are xanthine derivatives, we investigated whether other known xanthine derivatives, thatÂ is, caffeine, pentoxifylline, and theophylline can induce Noxa expression. However, we found that only the p53-pathway restoring CB002-analog xanthine compounds and not caffeine, pentoxifylline, and theophylline, induce Noxa protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Since Noxa can be transcriptionally activated independently of p53, we sought to explore other transcription factors involved in Noxa induction. We performed a knockdown of integrated stress response transcription factors ATF3/4 on SW480 cells. Knockdown of ATF3/4 upon treatment with 100 Î¼M CB002 or 25 Î¼M CB002-analog #4 abrogated Noxa protein induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Hence, our data suggests that ATF3/4 play a role in regulating Noxa expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>CB002-analog #4 treatment of human tumor cells enriches for cell cycle genes in addition to genes involved in the p53-pathway including apoptosis, indicating p53-pathway functional restoration</title><p>In order to understand how the CB002-analog molecules restore the p53-pathway, we performed a transcriptomic and proteomic analysis in SW480 cells treated with analog #4.

To verify the quality of our transcriptomic data, the principal component (PC) plot was obtained. PC plots show that the factor with most variability within the samples was the difference between control and treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1AâC</xref>). Significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs)Â were defined by a false discovery rate (FDR)&lt;0.05, and a total of 3362 genes met these criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). We then sought to identify the DEGs involved in the p53 pathway. To do this, a comprehensive known p53 target gene set used for comparison were the genes that have been previously shown to be directly regulated by p53 through chromatin immunoprecipitation assays assays and genes that were protein-coding genes in at least 3 of the 17 genome-wide data sets (from Fisherâs analysis; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fischer, 2017</xref>). Out of the 343 genes in the known p53 target gene set, 334 genes were tested in the microarray but only 197 genes met the low expression cutoff. From the 197 genes that met the low expression criteria, 102 genes were found to be differentially expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Gene ontology (GO) analysis of the 102 DEGs indicated that these genes are highly enriched in the regulation of programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). A gene expression heatmap of these genes is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, and the majority of the genes are found to be upregulated by analog #4 treatment of tumor cells. We then performed a transcription factor analysis of all 3362 DEGs. Transcription factor analysis defined by direct binding of predictive binding motifs revealed E2F transcription factors as having the highest normalized enrichment score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Because the transcription factor ATF4 was shown to be important for Noxa induction in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, we compared a known ATF4 gene set (Table S3 from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), along with an E2F gene set (Table S1 from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ren et al., 2002</xref>), together with the known p53 gene set and the DEGs in our analog #4 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The resulting Venn diagram of this comparison shows that both ATF4 and E2F targets genes are not unique to these transcription factors and also share common targets with p53 (~5%). Analyzing the ratio of DEGs to the transcription factor gene set did not show an obvious gene enrichment regulation of one transcription factor (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Despite p53 not being the top predictive transcription factor in our analysis, ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) determined p53 to be activated as an upstream regulator with a z-score value of 3.3 and p-value of 2.9Ã10<sup>â34</sup>. A Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis for the p53-pathway signaling was obtained with an adjusted p-value (adjp) equal to 1.18Ã10<sup>â1</sup> that despite not reflecting a significant enrichment of the p53 pathway, it indicates the presence of a total of 31 DEGs out of the 52 genes tested and present in the KEGG analysis. Thus, this accounts for 60% of DEGs in the KEGG p53-pathway analysis. DEGs involved in the KEGG analysis fold change is described by color and additional genes not shown in the p53-pathway figure and yet involved in the KEGG analysis are shown as a heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>). In line with the GO terms results, p53 target genes involved in apoptosis such as Noxa, Puma, and DR5 were upregulated by the analog #4 treatment. Taken together, this data indicates that although a large set of genes differentially expressed are not predicted to be directly regulated through direct p53 binding, a subset of these are enriched in the p53-pathway, indicative of p53-pathway restoration.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Enriched Biological Process Gene ontologyÂ (GO) terms in the 102 differentially expressed genes (DEGs)Â in CB002-analog #4 treated cells.</title><p>GO analysis for the 102 DEGs that are also known p53 target genes.

GO terms in biological processes also reflected enrichment of genes that participate in cell cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Taken together, KEGG analysis and GO ontology both reflected the downregulation of genes involved in the G1/S-phase of the cell cycle in CB002-analog treated cells. E2F is responsible for the induction of genes in DNA initiation and replication, such as minichromosome maintenanceÂ (MCM) complexes and origin replication complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bracken et al., 2004</xref>). The transcriptomic analysis indicates theÂ downregulation of these genes and this suggests the inhibition of E2F transcriptional activity. In addition, downregulation of Cyclin E and Cyclin A genes further confirmed the delay of cells to S-phase. GADD45, a p53-target gene that can induce cell cycle arrest, was upregulated. Further study is necessary in order to validate the direct implication of E2Fâs and p53 target genes in the perturbation of the delay in S-phase. Nonetheless, this data suggests that the identified family of small molecules represent a unique mechanism of action that involves S-phase delay perturbation and p53-pathway restoration.</p><table-wrap id="table3" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title>Enriched biological process Gene ontologyÂ (GO) terms in the 3362 differentially expressed genesÂ (DEGs).</title><p>GO analysis for all DEGs by analog #4 treatment.

Moreover, differences were observed at the level of protein expression between parental compound CB002 and its analog #4 both downregulated and to a lesser extent, upregulated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Thus, theÂ combination of chemotherapy agents with caffeine results in enhanced cancer cell cytotoxicity. Nonetheless, it was not pursued due to caffeineâs lack of achievable required concentrations in plasma. We investigated whether CB002 and its analogs can deregulate the G2Â checkpoint, like caffeine, pentoxifylline, and theophylline. We synchronized SW480 colon cancer cells using double thymidine block, released and treated with CB002-analog compound alone or in combination with etoposide, and probed for key G2/M-phase cell cycle markers. As expected, we observed that etoposide treatment enhances protein expression of pcdc2<sup>(Tyr15)</sup> and pcdc25c<sup>(Ser16)</sup> indicating cell cycle arrest due to DNA damage. The combination of etoposide with caffeine resulted in G2-deregulation as indicated by decreased expression of pcdc2<sup>(Tyr15)</sup> and pcdc25c<sup>(Ser16)</sup>. Similarly, the combination of etoposide with CB002 or CB002-analog #4 showed a decrease in expression of pcdc2<sup>(Tyr15)</sup> and pcdc25c<sup>(Ser16)</sup>. Nonetheless, CB002 or CB002-analog #4 do not increase M-phase marker pH3<sup>(Ser10)</sup> as would be expected for a G2-deregulator like caffeine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This data suggests that CB002 and CB002-analog #4 either do not deregulate the G2Â checkpoint or that these compounds delay cells going into M-phase. Moreover, CB002 and its analogs increase p-Cdc25c and p-Cdc2 in combination with etoposide indicating cell cycle arrest. A similar experiment was performed as a time course after cell synchronization release to further elucidate the cell cycle effects of CB002-analog #4. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, cell cycle markers pcdc2<sup>(Tyr15)</sup> and pcdc25c<sup>(Ser16)</sup> expression decreased in CB002-analog #4 compared to DMSO and etoposide and their expression over time increased at 12 hr indicative of a delay of cells in the G2 cell cycle phase. To further elucidate the effect in S-phase, we evaluated Cyclin A and p-RPA-RPA2<sup>(S8)</sup>, the latter as a marker of single-stranded DNA and replication stress that are potentially caused by stalled or collapsed replication forks. Cyclin A expression did not decrease over time in CB002-analog #4 treated cells as compared to DMSO and etoposide indicating that cells were delayed in S-phase. Moreover, p-RPA-RPA2<sup>(S8)</sup> expression upon CB002-analog #4 treatment was increased compared to DMSO indicating replication stress. The p53 target p21 was also found to increase in CB002-analog #4 treated cells indicating cell cycle arrest.

CB002-analog #4 enhances cytotoxicity as compared to the CB002 parent compound in the tested colorectal cancer patient-derived organoid as indicated by the cell viability response curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Moreover, the immunofluorescence assay staining for ethidium homodimer and calcein shows an increase of ethidium homodimer staining of CB002 and CB002-analog #4 to a larger extent as compared to vehicle control indicating an enhanced killing of cells. Calcein staining shows that organoids treated with CB002-analog #4 are smaller in size indicating that CB002-analog #4 decreases the growth of the patient-derived organoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

The defining members of this class that best exemplify the novel mechanistic properties are CB002-analogs #4 and #10. The properties of these CB002-analog xanthine compounds are different from other xanthines, such as caffeine, pentoxifylline, and theophylline, that do not restore p53 pathway signaling in tumors with mutant p53 and which deregulate a G2Â checkpoint rather than induce an S-phase checkpoint.</p><p>Our approach to discovering p53 pathway restoring compounds involved cell-based screening for functional restoration of p53-regulated reporter activity, coupled with cell death induction. Thus, small molecule lead compounds and structural-analogs were not expected to act directly on mutant p53 or restore binding of mutant p53 to genes normally regulated by p53. In the case of the compounds described here, activation of p53 target genes such as Noxa or DR5 occurred independently of p53 and this was observed in tumor cells with different p53 mutations. Thus, there is no expectation that CB002 or analogs #4 or #10 will cause mutant p53 to bind to DNA or chromatin in the regulatory regions of Noxa or DR5 in a manner that wild-type p53 does. Moreover, the induction of p53 targets occurred independently of p53 family member p73, but in a manner that requires integrated stress response transcription factor proteins ATF3/4. These results provide a molecular mechanism for activation of p53 target genes in a manner that substitutes transcription factors such as ATF3/4 for defective p53. This mechanism results in tumor suppression through induction of pro-apoptotic factors despite p53 mutation, and therefore acts as a bypass mechanism to prevent tumor growth in drug-treated cells.</p><p>CB002-analog #4 is 20â30 times more potent and like the CB002 parentalÂ compound restores the p53-pathway and induces apoptosis independently of p73. The 12 p53 pathway restoring structural analogs of CB002 tested were similar in that they resemble the structure of a xanthine. Our transcriptional analysis identified 102 genes involved in the p53-pathway and IPA determined p53 to be activated as an upstream regulator with a z-score value of 3.3 and p-value of 2.9Ã10<sup>â34</sup>. This data further validates the novel anti-cancer class of small molecules as p53-restoring drugs. Microarray analysis identified approximately 150 genes involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA synthesis, and repair that are significantly decreased compared to DMSO control. These genes include, minichromosome maintenance (MCM)Â proteins, Cyclin E, CDK, E2F, and Cdc2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplements 4</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s11">11</xref>). Proteomic analysis also confirmed a decrease in proteins involved in cell cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, our transcriptomic and proteomic analyses coincide in that CB002-analog #4 significantly reduces key regulators of the cell cycle. Taken together with the fact that known xanthines such as caffeine deregulate the G2Â checkpoint, we examined the effects of the CB002-analogs on the cell cycle. Our data indicate that the p53-restoring CB002-analog compounds, unlike known xanthines such as caffeine, pentoxifylline, and theophylline, restore the p53 and do not deregulate the G2Â checkpoint. Instead, treatment with these small molecule CB002-analogs results in activation of an S-phase DNA damage response pathway characterized by the increase in p-ATR<sup>(Thr1989)</sup> and we suggest this ultimately leads to a delay of cells in S-phase and this S-phase perturbation may contribute to cancer cell death. Importantly, the observed S-phase perturbation may lead to new therapeutic regimens such as synthetic lethality in BRCA-deficient cells and combination with PARP inhibitors.</p><p>We previously reported that pro-apoptotic protein Noxa plays a critical role in CB002-mediated cell death. Our data shows that CB002-analogs induce Noxa expression across different colorectal cancer cell lines in vitro. More importantly, we show that Noxa appears to be critical in vivo as CB002-analog #4 treatment of SW480 shNoxa tumors does not significantly reduce tumor volume as compared to vehicle control. We have evidence indicating that ATF3/4 play a role in regulating Noxa as knockdown of ATF3/4 results in theÂ decrease of Noxa protein expression. Our proteomic data shows activation of the integrated stress response as indicated by the increase of genes involved in the unfolded protein response, tRNA aminoacylation, and increase of ATF3/4 protein expression by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Whether the S-phase perturbation is a result of cellular stress remains to be addressed.</p><p>ATF3/4 can regulate similar targets of that of p53, including p21. Our laboratory has identified a small molecule PG3-Oc which involves the restoration of the p53 pathway independently of p53 through ATF4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tian et al., 2021</xref>). P53 has been shown to indirectly repress many cell cycle genes through the induction of p21. P21, in turn, binds to the DREAM repressor complex which represses genes controlled by E2Fs and CHR transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fischer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Engeland, 2018</xref>). We observed many cell cycle genes downregulated at the transcriptional level that are relevant to the p53 signal pathway. Moreover, our bioinformatic analysis predicted E2Fs as one of the transcription factors. We have previously shown that CB002 induces p21 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hernandez-Borrero et al., 2018</xref>), as well as analog #4 in this study thus it is possible that the observed S-phase perturbation is through p53-independent p21 stimulation that binds to DREAM complexes. Therefore, it will be interesting to see if ATF3/4 regulate p21 expression and the effect of p21 knockdown on cell cycle genes and affect the S-phase perturbation observed by CB002-analogs.</p><p>We show that CB002-analog #4 induces apoptosis in colorectal cancer patient-derived organoid cells and that it is safe both in vitro and in vivo as indicated by theÂ lack of a statistically significant increase in the sub-G1 population in normal human fibroblasts and also a healthy NSG mice body weight throughout treatment, respectively. The observed decrease in tumor volume was statistically significant at 5 weeks. This effect was suboptimal than desired and further optimization will be required to reach optimal effects. Importantly, the decrease in tumor volume by CB002-analog #4 is dependent on Noxa. As Noxa is not commonly mutated in human cancer, its induction by the CB002-analogs offers a feasible therapeutic advantage leading to tumor cell death and its expression may be used as a pharmacodynamic biomarker to predict therapeutic response. Taken together, our data suggests that CB002-analogs #4 and #10 represent a novel class of anti-tumor agents that provide a unique therapeutic strategy that can be clinically translated.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>CB002-analog small molecule secondaryÂ drug screening</title><p>CB002 structural analogs were obtained from ChemBridge Library and screening was performed in the human SW480 colorectal cancer cell line that stably expresses a p53-regulated luciferase reporter previously generated in our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wang et al., 2006</xref>).

The Sequest database search was performed with the following parameters: trypsin enzyme cleavage specificity, two possible missed cleavages, 10 ppm mass tolerance for precursor ions, andÂ 0.02 Da mass tolerance for fragment ions. Search parameters permitted dynamic modification of methionine oxidation (+15.9949 Da) and static modification of carbamidomethylation (+57.0215 Da) on cysteine. Peptide assignments from the database search were filtered down to a 1% FDR. The relative label-free quantitative and comparative among the samples were performed using the Minora algorithm and the adjoining bioinformatics tools of the Proteome Discoverer 2.4 software. To select proteins that show a statistically significant change in abundance between two groups, a threshold of 1.5-fold change with p-value (0.05) was selected.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>30,000 cells/well were seeded in eight-chamber slides.

been recognized to act through a unique mechanism of action involving significant restoration of the p53 pathway transcriptome, independently of p53, in tumors with mutated-p53 and the compounds trigger features of an S-phase checkpoint. The properties of this sub-class of xanthine compounds are different from classical xanthines such as caffeine, pentoxifylline, and theophylline that do not restore p53 pathway signaling in tumors with mutant p53 and which deregulate a G2-checkpoint rather than induce an S-phase checkpoint. The novel mechanism appears to involve transcription factors in the integrated stress response such as ATF3 and ATF4 leading to p53 and p73-independent pro-apoptotic Noxa upregulation and tumor cell death.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70429.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors' note: we include below the reviews that the authors received from another journal, along with the authorsâ responses.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This manuscript has been reviewed by three experts in the field, and all have similar concerns with lack of clarity of some of the figures and figure legends, and more particularly with lack of clarity as the mechanism of action of some of the compounds, and the conclusion that the compounds are lethal due to p53 pathway reactivation. Unfortunately the recommendation of all three Reviewers was reject. I know this decision will be disappointing for the authors, but it is my hope that these comments are useful to them as they plan next steps; please discuss with them the possibility of addressing these concerns and possibly transferring with reviews to MCT.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the manuscript previously submitted was misinterpreted by the reviewers. We never stated that the small molecules in this study activated p53, were p53 dependent, or rescued the mutant p53 to wild-type p53 activity. Instead, we claimed that these small molecules restore the p53 pathway by bypassing direct p53 activation. Our approach to discovering p53 pathway restoring compounds has over the last two decades involved live cell-based screening for functional restoration of p53-regulated reporter activity, coupled with cell death induction as a function of dose and time when we have tested chemical libraries. Thus, small molecule lead compounds and structural-analogues are not for the most part expected to act directly on mutant p53 or restore binding of mutant p53 to genes normally regulated by p53. Thus, there is no expectation that CB002 or its analogues will cause mutant p53 to bind to DNA or chromatin in the regulatory regions of p53 target genes in a manner that wild-type p53 does.</p><p>We showed that the effect of parental compound CB002 and its more potent analogue #4 IC50 values were similar in an isogenic panel of HCT116 cells (p53 null, p53 wild-type and p53 mutant), consistent with the fact that these small molecules are p53-independent. We describe the small molecules as compounds that restore the p53 signaling pathway through the involvement of other pathways. We showed that the integrated stress response ATF3 and ATF4 transcription factors play a role in the stimulation of pro-apoptotic p53 target gene, Noxa, a key mediator of apoptosis by these small molecules. Using the published Fischer p53 data-set (343 genes), we detected 197 genes and out of those, 102 were differentially expressed by analogue #4 indicating that nearly 50% of the established p53 target genes were altered.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Reviewer Comments to the Author):</p><p>In this manuscript, Hernandez Borrero et al. have extended their studies of the compound CB002 that they initially published on in Cell Cycle in 2018. In that paper they showed that this compound causes p53R175H degradation and a cell death mechanism that was dependent on Noxa. Here they attempt to elucidate this mechanism further as well as test analogues of the molecule that were synthesized in an attempt to improve potency. They show using a small number of cell lines induce Noxa independently of p73. They also show by transcriptomic and proteomic analysis that the compounds inhibit the cell cycle. Cell cycle analysis shows that compound cause an arrest in S-phase. Overall the paper has a number of major and minor problems that cause it not to be suitable for publication in the Journal. The biggest issue is the claim that the compounds restore the p53 signaling when the proteomic and transcriptomic data only weakly demonstrate that this. It s not clear if they are trying to claim that the compounds restore wild type function to mutant p53 by restoring site specific DNA binding (though it seems the compound activity is independent of p53). Another conclusion one can draw from this data is that the compounds have anti-cancer properties that kill cancer cells (more so than non-cancer cells) by an apoptotic mechanism. They also arrest cells in the Sphase of the cell cycle. Much of the transcriptomic and proteomic data are poorly annalzyed and poorly reported.</p><p>The structures of compounds are missing as are the rationale and depiction of the synthesis scheme.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments.

The new derivatives are more potent in inducing cell cycle disruption and inducing cell death in cell culture and tumor spheroid culture. The authors suggest this class compounds may be useful as novel cancer therapeutics based on their ability to restore p53 activity in tumor cells expressing mutant p53.</p><p>Identifying new compounds that restore the transcriptional function of mutant p53 is a challenging but attractive strategy of targeting mutant p53 in cancer. Currently there is a set of basic criteria that true mutant p53 rescue compounds are expected to meet, such as restoring mutant p53 binding to consensus DNA sequence in vivo and activating representative wt p53 target genes. Knockout of endogenous mutant p53 should eliminate the effect, and reintroduction of mutant p53 to a p53-null cell should restore the effect. The rescue compound is likely to interact with mutant p53 protein either non-covalently or covalently to change its conformation and DNA binding activity.</p><p>The compounds described in this study have not been rigorously tested in this regard and do not fit any of the above criteria. They induce a small number of genes that overlap with p53responsive genes, but it is unclear whether the induction is mediated by mutant p53. But curiously strong wt p53 target genes p21, MDM2, PUMA etc are not induced by these compounds. The results do not rule out the possibility that the small overlap in gene expression profile is coincidental, since p53 target genes can be regulated by other pathways and factors. Based on the data presented, it is premature to call these compounds mutant p53-rescue compounds or p53-pathway activating drugs.</p><p>The data mainly focused on analyzing the cell cycle and toxicity profile of the compounds, which is not very informative in terms of drug development. One would have like to see evidence of how the compounds restore mutant p53 function, whether they interact with p53 protein directly, if they do not act on p53 directly, what is their cellular target. Given the absence of these information, the manuscript is not suitable for publication.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments. We would like to clarify that we did not state in the manuscript that the small molecules activate p53, are p53-dependent, or rescue the mutant p53 to wild-type p53 activity. Rather, we attest that these small molecules restore the p53 pathway by bypassing direct p53 activation. Thus, it is not expected that CB002 or its analogues will cause mutant p53 to bind to DNA or chromatin in the regulatory regions of p53 target genes in a manner that wild-type p53 does. Therefore, the small molecules are not mutant p53-rescue compounds but rather p53-pathway restoring or bypass compounds.</p><p>We performed a microarray analysis to identify p53-responsive genes that were differentially expressed by the treatment of the most potent analogue #4. At the transcriptomic level, we showed that using the Fischer p53 data set (343 genes), we detected 197 genes and out of those, 102 were differentially expressed by analogue #4 indicating that nearly 50% of the established p53 target genes were altered. This is a significant overlap of p53-regulated genes. We validated several p53 target genes including DR5 and Noxa. In the original manuscript p21 was not shown but we extended this observation in the updated manuscript (Figure 5D). MDM2 and Puma were not shown therefore it is not accurate to state that these target genes were not induced, rather they were not part of the scope of the shown experiment.</p><p>Although the molecular target was not identified in this study, we provide evidence that the integrated stress response ATF3 and ATF4 transcription factors play a role in the stimulation of pro-apoptotic p53 target gene, Noxa, a key mediator of apoptosis by these small molecules.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some specific comments</p><p>Figure 1A. compound concentration range in the p53 reporter assay was not provided.

Mutant p53 is not required to activate the p53 reporter thus a CRISPR knockout would not be expected to abrogate the p53 reporter activity. At the conditions tested (6 hr) for the p53 reporter assay, CB002 analogue #4 had a modest reporter activation but showed the strongest cell killing in the cytotoxicity assays performed at 48 hrs. Because the p53 reporter assay is based on early transcriptional effects, we believed that at 6 hrs the signaling effect for analogue #4 may have already ceased given that it was the most potent drug and most likely the signal transduction was initiated and terminated compared to the other compounds tested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig1F.

The authors observed that the compound leads to S-phase checkpoint activation, with increased phosphorylation of RPA, ATR, cyclin E and decreased levels of phosphorylated H3 and proteins related to DNA synthesis. Moreover, the authors report that CB002 and its analogues induce apoptosis in cells, as seen through higher proportion of sub-G1 cells, increased PARP cleavage and a release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. Noxa was shown to be upregulated upon treatment with CB002 and its analogues. Importantly, Noxa depletion inhibited the anti-tumor effects exerted by analogue #4 in vivo, suggesting an important role of Noxa in mediating apoptosis downstream of this compound. The compound tested showed limited toxicity in normal cells, as shown in cell culture and mouse studies, further suggesting a potential of this compound to be brought forward for further clinical studies. The authors propose this molecule as a potential therapeutic approach in targeting tumors that have a p53 mutation.</p><p>The potential of CB002 and its derivatives can be appreciated from this manuscript. However, the currently reported data do not provide evidence that these compounds act through p53. Without thorough additional experimentation, it cannot be concluded that p53 reactivation is the major mechanism by that these drugs are acting. As it stands, it is at least equally possible (if not more conceivable) that these are cytotoxic drugs that act independent of p53.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript text itself was well written, and easy to read. However, the figures were slightly messy and not very intuitive. Often, figure legends lack sufficient details that help readers understand the figures. Certain labels are cropped off and not aligned very well with the results. The use of many different CB002 analogues is appreciated, but the lack of consistency between the analogues shown in the results is also confusing. The manuscript would benefit from mentioning why a particular analogue (and not the others) was chosen and shown for a particular experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments.

We then show that a subset of these analogues in Figure 1C induce apoptosis. As we started studying the cell cycle effects, we focused on the analogues that fit the criteria of the new class of small molecules i.e. perturbation of the S-phase of the cell cycle and restoration of the p53 pathway. We then concentrated the majority of the manuscript on the most potent CB002 analogue #4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments:</p><p>1. Although the clinical potential of these compounds is interesting, especially considering its lack of toxicity in normal cells, the link to p53 is weak.

We do not conclude p53 pathway restoration solely on the p53-responsive luciferase reporter which was a preliminary result years ago at an early point in the history of this work. We incorporate a microarray analysis and compare the differentially expressed genes to the Fischer data set. In this comparison, we detected 197 p53-responsive genes and out of those, 102 were differentially expressed by CB002 analogue #4 indicating that nearly 50% of the established p53 target genes were altered.

This can be due to one of two reasons; the compounds activate p53 which leads to induction of ATF3/4, then to Noxa, or these compounds lead to the activation of other pathways that induces ATF3/4 (i.e: the Integrated stress response). Therefore, the p53 knockdown experiment is important here to prove the role of p53 in their system. On the same note, I am curious to know if these cells in Supp. Figure 10C with ATF3/4 kd survive CB002/ analogue #4 treatment. If Noxa is the key mediator of cell death here, one would expect that these cells escape the apoptosis-inducing effects of the compounds.</p></disp-quote><p>Supp Figure 10C is now Figure 1I. We thank the reviewer for this comment. Restoration of the p53 pathway in mutant p53-harboring cells by these small molecules is independent of p53, thus it is no expected that knockdown of p53 will have an effect on Noxa expression. Studies from our lab suggest novel involvement of integrated stress response transcription factors ATF3/4 in the induction of p53 target genes (10.1016/j.neo.2021.01.004) and this manuscript suggests similar based on its findings with a different class of compounds that bypass the p53 pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Does this not further suggest an alternative pathway of activation downstream of the compound? The integrated stress response again was mentioned in the discussion (line 301). It would be of high interests to test if these compounds lead to apoptosis or an S-phase checkpoint activation because of the stress response rather than p53.
