(Fahrenfort et al., 2025). This leads them to conclude that “subjective measures do not reliably measure the construct they intend to measure” and that their construct validity is threatened. Here, we argue that the main findings had already been demonstrated in other experiments, and the general limitations of subjective measures has been known for decades without the field dismissing their usefulness. We further argue that the experimental manipulations of Fahrenfort and colleagues are so radical that they could be used to invalidate essentially any psychological/cognitive test. In our view, both of the above-mentioned conclusions are thus inappropriate considering the evidence presented, and we believe that the take-home message both before and after the study of Fahrenfort and colleagues is to acknowledge the limitations of subjective reports when they are used.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>consciousness</kwd><kwd>signal detection theory</kwd><kwd>unconscious</kwd><kwd>subliminal</kwd><kwd>subthreshold</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>We are writing to comment on the article by Fahrenfort et al., 2025 about neural measures of consciousness.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Fahrenfort et al., 2025</xref> examine the effect of auditory and monetary punishment on ratings of visual awareness. As participants alter their response pattern to avoid punishment, the authors conclude that awareness rating scales are vulnerable to criterion effects, which affects neural measurements of consciousness. For example, they report that since the perceptual awareness scale (PAS) was affected by criterion shifts (from a signal detection theory perspective), the construct validity of the measure should be questioned (see their Results section), as should subjective measures in general (see their Discussion section). In this comment, we question the assumptions on which this conclusion is based.</p><p>A key worry of Fahrenfort and colleagues is that ratings of “no experience” cannot be taken at face value as such ratings might include instances of very weak experiences. When the criterion is conservative (i.e., a lot of evidence is required to report seeing “a brief glimpse” as opposed to “no experience”), then response accuracy and neural activity related to “no experience” increases. As the authors mention themselves towards the end of the <italic>Introduction</italic>, this criticism is by no means new. And in fact, both key findings – (1) that the amount of estimated subliminal perception varies with criterion changes and (2) that experimental context can change subjective rating response patterns – have been reported in recent articles without prompting us to dismiss subjective measures. As we explain below, the main aspect to keep in mind are the limitations that the use of the measures imposes on the conclusions to be drawn.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Assumptions of subjective measures</title><p>The PAS is a participant-generated awareness rating scale with four steps ranging from “no experience” (called PAS0 and [0] by Fahrenfort and colleagues) to “clear experience” (PAS3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ramsøy and Overgaard, 2004</xref>). In relation to the PAS, Fahrenfort and colleagues report in the <italic>Results</italic> section that the underlying assumption is “that selecting [0] will only occur if trials are ‘truly’ unseen, so that unconscious processing is not overestimated, as may happen in dichotomous or other types of scales (Overgaard et al., 2006; Overgaard and Sandberg, 2021; Sandberg et al., 2010). The PAS was developed to be able to resolve the inability to externally calibrate subjective content, and as such its ultimate goal seems to be to be impervious to non-perceptual criterion shifts”. No such claims were made, however, in the central referenced articles or elsewhere – and working with and developing the PAS, we are in fact often careful to highlight the opposite.</p><p>In a number of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Overgaard et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ramsøy and Overgaard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Sandberg et al., 2010</xref>), we argue that some “unconscious” effects disappear when using the PAS – potentially because the effects were established using scales with more conservative criteria than the PAS. Nevertheless, this does not mean that any effects found with the PAS should then be considered truly unconscious or that the scale is impervious to criterion shifts/criterion effects. Indeed, we discuss how to identify a “preferred scale” in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Overgaard and Sandberg, 2012</xref> and in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Sandberg et al., 2010</xref>, we specifically compare scales without claiming that any are free from exhaustiveness (i.e., criterion) problems.</p><p>The first assumption of Fahrenfort et al. is thus that researchers believe that awareness ratings should be treated as flawless insights into participants’ experience. This is a niche position. For example, 32 researchers advise against relying on subjective measures alone to establish evidence of unconscious processing, stating that there is currently no definitive way to determine if above-chance performance is conscious when participants report no experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Stockart et al., 2024</xref>, p. 14). In personal communication, Fahrenfort et al. refer to the PAS scale step description as evidence for their claims, but participant instructions and scientific conclusions are clearly not to be equated.</p><p>Relatedly, Fahrenfort et al. appear to assume that awareness ratings are only useful if they reflect experience perfectly at all times (otherwise, why would their validity be threatened if we find this not to be the case?). It is trivially true that a non-perfect psychological measure could be clinically relevant for diagnostics and that one with, e.g., a specificity and sensitivity of 0.9 is better than one with 0.8. So, why would we not attempt to identify an optimal subjective measure even if we know it is not perfect? The key issue appears to be to acknowledge the limitation of the measures used.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Similarity of findings – different conclusions</title><p>In one article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Sandberg et al., 2022</xref>), we specifically discuss the limitations of subjective reports and draw attention to how one may study effects below the (reported) subjective threshold without making assumptions of whether it is truly unconscious processing. Using modelling very similar to that of Fahrenfort and colleagues, we demonstrate that the estimated capacity of subthreshold processing varies as a function of the criterion for reporting awareness, with conservative criteria resulting in larger effects – exactly as Fahrenfort and colleagues find (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Sandberg et al., 2022</xref>, Figure 5B). Nevertheless, we also find that task accuracy above chance is expected to be found for any non-zero criterion and in situations that are unaffected by criterion shifts and regression to the mean effects.</p><p>The other main finding of Fahrenfort and colleagues – that report criteria depend on experimental context – has also been established previously. In one article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Skewes et al., 2021</xref>), we demonstrated this using a false feedback paradigm. When participants received false feedback on accuracy whenever they reported seeing “a weak glimpse” of the stimulus, they changed their response pattern. A similar, yet different, pattern was observed for false confidence ratings feedback, leading us to conclude that awareness and confidence ratings rely on at least partially different processes. That different measures of consciousness lead to different findings, has been reported in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Lohse and Overgaard, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Mazzi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Overgaard and Mogensen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Overgaard and Sandberg, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Rausch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Szczepanowski et al., 2013</xref>). Considering this, it may seem surprising that Fahrenfort and colleagues administered the PAS with multiple adaptations as we explain below.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Assumptions of instructions</title><p>Fahrenfort and colleagues made changes to the PAS – in terms of instructions and administration of punishment of particular reports – which they themselves consider to be so substantial that it may be argued that they did not in fact use the PAS at all (see their <italic>Discussion</italic>). Participants were informed: “<italic>Only press 0 if you are 100% convinced that no square appeared and only press 3 if you are 100% convinced that a square appeared.”</italic> As this encourage participants to report based on confidence, it is not clear what the reports actually represent. For this reason, we have previously attempted to explain how to help participants understand what it involves reporting on experiences avoiding terminology related to confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Sandberg and Overgaard, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Fahrenfort and colleagues argue that the changes are unproblematic because there is no such thing as a criterion-free experimental context, and because many dimensions not controlled between experiments will have large effects on criteria. This defence does not take into account that qualitatively different processes (awareness vs. confidence) may be probed.</p><p>While participants were encouraged to report honestly using the PAS, they received a secondary set of implicit instructions to avoid certain outcomes reinforced through two types of punishment. The final assumption of Fahrenfort et al. is thus that psychological test responses should be immune to punishment, yet punishment can be used to disrupt the result of essentially any psychological test. Imagine, for example, one group of participants being punished whenever they indicate extraversion in a personality test, and another group being punished for introversion. If punishment is severe enough, the groups would appear to differ greatly on introversion/extraversion. In neuroscientific memory or perception paradigms, we could make the neural correlates increase, decrease or change location if we are creative enough with respect to which responses are punished. But we would not have proven anything other than the effectiveness of punishment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our concern is that the study of Fahrenfort and colleagues primarily adds detail to what was already known about the limitations of subjective measures. While some researchers have perhaps previously concluded too strongly based on subjective measures, we believe that Fahrenfort and colleagues do the same, but in the opposite direction. The study does not attempt to evaluate how large the criterion effects are in natural settings when the PAS is used with recommended instructions and without punishment. The study mainly reestablishes that punishment alters behaviour.</p><p>The majority of the criticism raised by Fahrenfort and colleagues can be mitigated simply by acknowledging the limitations of the method as most researchers already do. The conclusions of nearly all studies contrasting more versus less clear experiences (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2016</xref>) are not threatened by the limitations. The magnitude of the differences may vary with criteria, but this is rarely relevant (other than in relation to statistical power) when the aim is to reject a hypothesis of no difference. Another field open to study are effects that occur for all criteria as shown, for example, by modelling (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Sandberg et al., 2022</xref>). Even current attempts to create theoretical models based on an understanding of consciousness as continuous do not attempt to interpret findings using the PAS as immune to all hypothetical confounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Fazekas and Overgaard, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Mogensen and Overgaard, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Overgaard and Mogensen, 2017</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s3"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s4"><title>Data availability</title><p>No data was analysed.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Andersen</surname><given-names>LM</given-names></name><name><surname>Pedersen</surname><given-names>MN</given-names></name><name><surname>Sandberg</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Overgaard</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2016">2016</year><article-title>Occipital MEG activity in the early time range (&lt;300 ms) predicts graded changes in perceptual consciousness</article-title><source>Cerebral Cortex</source><volume>26</volume><fpage>2677</fpage><lpage>2688</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1093/cercor/bhv108</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">26009612</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fahrenfort</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>PA</given-names></name><name><surname>Kloosterman</surname><given-names>NA</given-names></name><name><surname>Stein</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>van Gaal</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2025">2025</year><article-title>Criterion placement threatens the construct validity of neural measures of consciousness</article-title><source>eLife</source><volume>13</volume><elocation-id>RP102335</elocation-id><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.102335</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fazekas</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Overgaard</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2016">2016</year><article-title>Multidimensional models of degrees and levels of consciousness</article-title><source>Trends in Cognitive Sciences</source><volume>20</volume><fpage>715</fpage><lpage>716</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.tics.2016.06.011</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lohse</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Overgaard</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2019">2019</year><article-title>Emotional priming depends on the degree of conscious experience</article-title><source>Neuropsychologia</source><volume>128</volume><fpage>96</fpage><lpage>102</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2017.10.028</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">29129593</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib5"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mazzi</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Bagattini</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Savazzi</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2016">2016</year><article-title>Blind-Sight vs. degraded-sight: different measures tell a different story</article-title><source>Frontiers in Psychology</source><volume>7</volume><elocation-id>901</elocation-id><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00901</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">27378993</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib6"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mogensen</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Overgaard</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2017">2017</year><article-title>Reorganization of the connectivity between elementary functions -

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included. Since no essential revisions were requested there is no accompanying author response.</italic></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article 'Comment on 'Criterion placement threatens the construct validity of neural measures of consciousness' to <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor (Ming Meng) and a Senior Editor (Joshua Gold).</p><p>Reviewer Comments</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This commentary by Sandberg and Overgaard disagrees with Fahrenfort et al.’s (2025) main conclusion. Fahrenfort et al. say that subjective measures (like the PAS scale) are invalid because they are affected by how people set their decision criteria (&quot;criterion effects&quot;). Sandberg and Overgaard contend that: (1) the limitations of subjective reports are already well-established in the field; (2) Fahrenfort et al.'s experimental manipulations (punishment, modified instructions) are too extreme to generalize; and (3) the study fails to contextualize its findings within existing literature. The rebuttal is well-supported by prior work but could more explicitly propose solutions for mitigating criterion effects.</p><p>Substantive concerns</p><p>1. The Epistemological Dilemma of &quot;True&quot; Unconsciousness:</p><p>Both papers grapple with the fundamental impossibility of directly verifying subjective states. Fahrenfort et al. implicitly assume that a &quot;truly unseen&quot; state exists and can be reliably isolated with a perfect measure. Sandberg &amp; Overgaard correctly note that establishing this &quot;ground truth&quot; is impossible.</p><p>2. Conflation of Measurement Validity with Construct Existence:</p><p>Fahrenfort et al.'s conclusion that criterion shifts &quot;threaten construct validity&quot; risks conflating the measurement of a construct with the existence of the construct itself. Their manipulations show that reports of awareness are malleable, but this does not invalidate the construct of perceptual consciousness or the neural correlates studied. Sandberg &amp; Overgaard touch on this by noting neural correlates of graded awareness remain valid.</p><p>3. Lack of Engagement with the Purpose of Graded Scales:</p><p>Fahrenfort et al.'s focus on the malleability of the &quot;no experience&quot; criterion overlooks the primary purpose of graded scales like the PAS: capturing gradations in conscious clarity. These scales are designed to distinguish &quot;clear&quot; from &quot;vague&quot; experiences within reportable consciousness, enabling the study of neural correlates of graded awareness. While criterion shifts affect category boundaries, they may have less impact on neural distinctions between extremes (e.g., PAS3 vs. PAS1-2).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The critique questions the originality of Fahrenfort et al.'s paper, arguing that the main findings were already well-known and that there is a risk of misinterpretation in the experimental instructions of Experiment 2, rendering the data insufficient to support the conclusions. However, the listed main findings in the text seem to have been misunderstood. The key findings mentioned in the introduction are not the main conclusions of the study but rather assumptions for data simulation and neural decoding analysis. The critique's hypotheses in the discussion section also do not align with the original text. Criticisms based on misinterpreted findings and assumptions are unfounded. It is recommended that the authors analyze and explain how the misinterpretation of key findings and assumptions occurred. If there are issues in the original text leading to misinterpretation, clear revision suggestions should be proposed to reduce ambiguity in the article and minimize the risk of misinterpretation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
