derivatives: the neural plate, neural crest, placodes and epidermis. Elegant functional experiments in a range of vertebrate models have provided an in-depth understanding of gene regulatory interactions within the ectoderm. However, these experiments conducted at tissue level raise seemingly contradictory models for fate allocation of individual cells. Here, we carry out single cell RNA sequencing of chick ectoderm from primitive streak to neurulation stage, to explore cell state diversity and heterogeneity. We characterise the dynamics of gene modules, allowing us to model the order of molecular events which take place as ectodermal fates segregate. Furthermore, we find that genes previously classified as neural plate border ‘specifiers’ typically exhibit dynamic expression patterns and are enriched in either neural, neural crest or placodal fates, revealing that the neural plate border should be seen as a heterogeneous ectodermal territory and not a discrete transitional transcriptional state. Analysis of neural, neural crest and placodal markers reveals that individual NPB cells co-express competing transcriptional programmes suggesting that their ultimate identify is not yet fixed. This population of ‘border located undecided progenitors’ (BLUPs) gradually diminishes as cell fate decisions take place. Considering our findings, we propose a probabilistic model for cell fate choice at the neural plate border. Our data suggest that the probability of a progenitor’s daughters to contribute to a given ectodermal derivative is related to the balance of competing transcriptional programmes, which in turn are regulated by the spatiotemporal position of a progenitor.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell fate decisions</kwd><kwd>sensory placodes</kwd><kwd>neural crest</kwd><kwd>neural plate</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/S005536/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thiery</surname><given-names>Alexandre P</given-names></name><name><surname>Buzzi</surname><given-names>Ailin Leticia</given-names></name><name><surname>Streit</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/R006342/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thiery</surname><given-names>Alexandre P</given-names></name><name><surname>Buzzi</surname><given-names>Ailin Leticia</given-names></name><name><surname>Streit</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>108874/B/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luscombe</surname><given-names>Nicholas M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheshire</surname><given-names>Chris</given-names></name><name><surname>Luscombe</surname><given-names>Nicholas M</given-names></name><name><surname>Briscoe</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheshire</surname><given-names>Chris</given-names></name><name><surname>Luscombe</surname><given-names>Nicholas M</given-names></name><name><surname>Briscoe</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheshire</surname><given-names>Chris</given-names></name><name><surname>Luscombe</surname><given-names>Nicholas M</given-names></name><name><surname>Briscoe</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>108874/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hamrud</surname><given-names>Eva</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

During development, it arises from only three progenitor populations: the neural plate generates the entire central nervous system, while neural crest and sensory placodes jointly form the peripheral nervous system. Placode derivatives are confined to the head contributing to sense organs and cranial ganglia, while neural crest cells form along the entire body axis to generate various cell types including neurons and glial as well as parts of the craniofacial skeleton, cartilage, and teeth (for review: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker and Bronner-Fraser, 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baker and Bronner-Fraser, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grocott et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Patthey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pla and Monsoro-Burq, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Prasad et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Simões-Costa and Bronner, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The neural plate becomes morphologically distinct shortly after gastrulation. At its edge, the co-expression of both neural and non-neural markers broadly demarcate the neural plate border (NPB): an ectodermal territory which has been identified in a range of vertebrate species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bhat et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kwon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pla and Monsoro-Burq, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Roellig et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Streit, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Thiery et al., 2020</xref>). Lineage tracing has shown that the NPB contains a mixture of neural, neural crest, placodal, and epidermal precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bhattacharyya et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bronner-Fraser and Fraser, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dutta et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kozlowski et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pieper et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Streit, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). As the neural plate invaginates, placode precursors remain in the surface ectoderm, while neural crest progenitors are largely incorporated into neural folds from where they delaminate and migrate extensively. Although the induction of these three fates has been studied for decades, some of the most fundamental questions remain unresolved. For example, we do not know when and how these lineages segregate, whether they do so in a specific order and how individual cells make these decisions.</p><p>Modulation of different signalling pathways plays a crucial role in controlling the fate of all ectodermal cells. FGF signalling is required for the specification of neural, neural crest and placode precursors and for positioning the NPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahrens and Schlosser, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Litsiou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Londin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Monsoro-Burq et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Streit et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Streit and Stern, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Stuhlmiller and García-Castro, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wilson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yardley and García-Castro, 2012</xref>). While BMP signalling must be inhibited for neural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hemmati-Brivanlou et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Linker and Stern, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Londin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sasai et al., 1995</xref>), it is necessary for placode precursor formation at gastrulation, but must be switched off thereafter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahrens and Schlosser, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kwon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Litsiou et al., 2005</xref>). Likewise, neural crest cells need BMP activity early, but unlike placodes, continue to do so as they are firmly established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barth et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kwon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liem et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marchant et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Steventon et al., 2009</xref>). Finally, Wnt activity is required for neural crest cell induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">García-Castro et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Steventon et al., 2009</xref>) but must be inhibited for neural and placode precursors to form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heeg-Truesdell and LaBonne, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Litsiou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Patthey et al., 2008</xref>). These signals activate different transcription factor networks in a temporally and spatially controlled manner, which in turn are thought to impart cell identity and have therefore been termed fate ‘specifiers’. For example, <italic>Msx1</italic> and <italic>Pax3</italic> have been implicated as NPB specifiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Milet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Monsoro-Burq, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Plouhinec et al., 2014</xref>), whereas <italic>Pax7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Basch et al., 2006</xref>) and <italic>Six1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brugmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Christophorou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ozaki et al., 2004</xref>) control neural crest and placode precursor formation, respectively. These factors appear to act in feed forward loops, upregulating their own expression while simultaneously repressing factors that specify alternative fates (for review: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grocott et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Thiery et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Based on these studies combined with tissue transplantation experiments, various models for the segregation of neural, neural crest, and placodal fates have emerged (for review: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schlosser, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schlosser, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Thiery et al., 2020</xref>), some proposing that the NPB is an area of ‘indecision’. Most recently, two apparently contradictory models have been discussed more widely. The ‘binary competence model’ proposes that while a territory containing neural crest and placodal precursors exists at the time of gastrulation, this territory is rapidly subdivided into neural/neural crest competent and placode/epidermal competent ectoderm through changes in the regulatory relationships of the transcription factors expressed (sequence of cell fate decisions: [epidermal-placodal]-[NC-neural]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahrens and Schlosser, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pieper et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schlosser, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maharana and Schlosser, 2018</xref>). This implies a closer relationship of neural crest cells with the central nervous system and of placodes with the epidermis. In contrast, the ‘NPB model’ suggests that cells at the border of the neural plate have mixed identity and retain the ability to generate all ectodermal derivatives until after neurulation begins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker and Bronner-Fraser, 1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Roellig et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Streit and Stern, 1999</xref>). Other studies in <italic>Xenopus</italic> have taken this idea a step further, revealing that unlike other ectodermal cells, cells at the NPB retain pluripotency markers which is key for their multipotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Buitrago-Delgado et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Prasad et al., 2012</xref>). In support of this idea, the NPB region is initially characterised by co-expression of neural and non-neural markers (for review: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grocott et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pla and Monsoro-Burq, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Thiery et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The distinguishing feature of the binary competence and NPB models is the proposed order in which cell fate decisions are made. The NPB model does not imply a specific sequence of decision events, whilst the binary competence model proposes that NPB progenitors transition through an intermediate fate restricted state. While both models are attractive and provide working hypotheses, the underlying experiments were analysed at cell population, rather than at single cell level. Furthermore, the literature is heavily biased towards investigating formation of neural crest cells, which are absent in the most anterior NPB. Therefore, these models do not consider the differences in potential fate decisions along the antero-posterior axis but propose that all cells at the neural plate border face the same set of discrete choices. Recent findings have proposed that prior to fate commitment, cells show increasing levels of heterogeneity in gene expression and do not exhibit a definitive transcriptional signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Soldatov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Subkhankulova et al., 2023</xref>). It is therefore possible that cells at the NPB include such undecided progenitor cells.</p><p>Studies in chick have begun to characterise cell heterogeneity at the NPB at a single-cell level revealing that factors previously thought to be fate-specific are co-expressed in individual cells even at late neural tube stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Roellig et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Williams et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, classical lineage tracing reveals that individual ectodermal cells can give rise to both neural and neural crest even at fairly late stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bronner-Fraser and Fraser, 1988</xref>), while more a more recent study using a neural-specific <italic>Sox2</italic> enhancer shows that Sox2<sup>+</sup> cells can contribute not only to neural tissue but also to neural crest and epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Roellig et al., 2017</xref>). However, these studies only surveyed a relatively small number of ectodermal cells and, focusing on neural crest cells, did not include data for definitive placodal cells. It is therefore challenging to assess how these fates segregate. Nevertheless, these findings suggest that cell fate allocation at the NPB occurs over a much longer developmental period than previously thought and that some NPB cells retain plasticity until early neurulation.</p><p>Here, we explore the transcriptional changes as cells transit from the neural plate border at early primitive streak to definitive neural, neural crest and placodal fates at single cell level (for analysis workflow see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In total, we present single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) data for 17,992 high-quality cells. Rather than using 2–3 molecular markers to assign cell identity, we established a binary knowledge matrix using previously published in situ hybridisation expression data. This allows us to classify cells at each developmental stage, despite the high levels of heterogeneity observed. We find that prior to head fold stages cells do not fall into transcriptional distinct groups but are characterised by graded and partially overlapping gene expression. An early cell population located at the NPB (eNPB) can be identified by co-expression of neural and non-neural genes prior to the upregulation of fate specifiers. As development proceeds, ectodermal cell diversity increases, with a division of neural and non-neural fates becoming apparent at the first somite stage together with the emergence of neural crest cells.

Comparing co-expression of whole gene modules (rather than individual transcripts) reveals that many cells at the NPB co-express gene modules which later become restricted to placodal or neural crest lineages. These cells may have the potential to give rise to both (or more) fates and we therefore refer to them as ‘Border-Located Undecided Progenitors’ (BLUPs). Interestingly, as progenitors segregate into their respective fates, we no longer identify NPB clusters but continue to find BLUPs. BLUPs connect segregating cell populations, resembling previously characterised bridge cells in the differentiating murine neural crest which exhibit high heterogeneity prior to segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Soldatov et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we propose that BLUPs continue to be plastic until neural tube closure, maintaining the ability to contribute to different fates. Overall, our analysis highlights that although the NPB demarcates an anatomical region, it is not a discrete transcriptional state. Instead, we identify BLUPs which we predict to be in an undecided state and to retain the potential to contribute toward alternative ectodermal fates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Classification of ectodermal cells using a binary knowledge matrix of known marker genes</title><p>Neural, neural crest and placode cells arise from the embryonic ectoderm.

However, this approach is difficult to apply to the NPB for several reasons. Firstly, the early NPB cannot be classified using definitive markers as it emerges in the region of overlap between neural and non-neural genes. Secondly, cells at the NPB are thought to be in a transitory state before they acquire their definitive ectodermal fate (neural, neural crest, placodal and epidermal). Finally, cells at the NPB appear to be highly heterogeneous, with precursors for the different fates found intermingled, even at late stages of neurulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bhattacharyya et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bronner-Fraser and Fraser, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ezin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Roellig et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Streit, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Williams et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). To overcome these challenges, we categorised cells using a binary knowledge matrix based on expression data obtained from the literature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We examined available in situ hybridisation data of 76 genes with known regionalised expression patterns and binarized their expression within each defined cell state. This allowed us to define a total of 24 cell states spanning primitive streak to neural tube stages.

While some genes are shared between many cells, early neural plate cells are defined by high levels of pre-neural transcripts while the non-neural and extraembryonic ectoderm are characterised by increased non-neural gene expression. Notably, we identify an early NPB population which co-expresses both neural and non-neural genes.

Finally, since our data show that the segregation of neural, neural crest and placodal cell states is almost complete at ss8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), we kept those gene modules that show differential expression between at least one of the three fates at ss8 (see Materials and methods).

In contrast, latent time can measure the biological clock of individual cells as they differentiate and thus represents the order of cells along a developmental trajectory. To explore the expression dynamics of the five selected gene modules as neural, neural crest, and placodal fates emerge, we first ordered cells across latent time using scVelo for the entire dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To investigate the segregation of all three fates, three separate trajectories need to be distinguished. To do this, we calculated the probability of each cell to transit towards one of three terminal states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These probabilities were obtained using CellRank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lange et al., 2022</xref>), which leverages RNA velocity and transcriptomic similarity information to predict transitions between cells. Visualising the fate probabilities across the full dataset shows that cells with low latent time values (i.e. early cells) have low probabilities of becoming neural, neural crest or placodal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> for stage reference). As cells ‘age’ the fate probability increases as they become transcriptionally similar to the terminal state. Unlike placodal and neural fates, neural crest fate probabilities are only high in ‘late’ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), reflecting the fact that defined neural crest cell clusters only appear at HH7.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4-3"><title>Gene module dynamics reveals key differences in the activation of neural, neural crest, and PPR programmes</title><p>Having predicted the developmental trajectory of cells using scVelo and CellRank, we next modelled the expression of the five selected gene modules as a function of latent time with the aim to characterise their dynamics. Gene expression dynamics were modelled using generalised additive models (GAMs). GAMs were chosen because gene expression is highly dynamic and does not change linearly over time. For each gene module, we fitted three separate GAMs, one for each fate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; left). The three fates were distinguished using the previously calculated fate absorption probabilities. This modelling approach reveals dynamic changes of gene expression. Three gene modules – GM9, GM13, GM23 – are initially inactive and are upregulated at different points across latent time in cells with neural, neural crest, and placodal character, respectively.</p><p>GM9 becomes upregulated in all neural clusters and includes neural markers like <italic>Lmo1</italic> and <italic>Sox21</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> ‘Neural GM9’, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). Although the expression of different genes within this module correlates broadly, there is some gene-gene variation. For example, <italic>Lmo1</italic> is the first gene to be expressed and exhibits highly dynamic expression over time. It is first found at HH5 within the eCN, pNP and iNP, before being upregulated across the entire neural plate at HH7 and ss4. At ss8, <italic>Lmo1</italic> is specifically downregulated within the MB. In contrast, <italic>Sox21</italic> is first upregulated at HH5/6 and is consistently expressed throughout all neural cell clusters.</p><p>In contrast, modelling reveals that GM13 is upregulated in cells with neural crest identity. Indeed, it contains well known neural crest markers <italic>Pax7</italic>, <italic>Snai2</italic>, <italic>Sox10,</italic> and <italic>Tfap2b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> ‘NC GM13’, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>) and is initially broadly activated in NPB and neural crest clusters at HH7. At ss4 and ss8, this module remains strongly expressed within neural crest and delaminating neural crest clusters. Within GM13 individual genes are activated at different time points: <italic>Pax7</italic> is the first gene to be expressed in the pNPB at HH5, while <italic>Sox10</italic> starts to be expressed only from ss4 onwards.</p><p>Finally, modelling the expression dynamics of GM23 shows that it is activated early and becomes upregulated in cells with placodal character across latent time. This prediction is supported by the fact that GM23 is highly expressed in PPR clusters at ss8 and contains bona fide placodal genes like <italic>Six1</italic> and <italic>Eya2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> ‘Placodal GM23’, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). At HH4, most GM23 genes are not expressed, but are broadly activated at HH5 in PPR, non-neural and NPB clusters, where they remain active until becoming restricted to PPR cells at ss4. Comparing the onset of activation of these three gene modules across latent time reveals a clear temporal order with the placodal module being activated first, followed by the neural and neural crest gene modules.</p><p>In contrast to these modules, modelling of GM24 and GM21 shows that they are initially expressed in all three cell populations before being rapidly downregulated within neural crest and neural cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> ‘Epiblast GM21’ and ‘Epiblast GM24’). Indeed, genes in GM24 are broadly expressed across the epiblast at HH4, and then become gradually restricted to PPR, non-neural and NPB clusters at HH6/7, and to PPR cells at ss4/8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). GM21 displays similar dynamics but is restricted to non-neural clusters earlier at HH5.

We show, using an unbiased gene module approach, that a placodal gene module is activated first, followed by neural and neural crest modules. While neural and neural crest modules are specifically activated in the relevant cell clusters alone, two modules that are later restricted to the PPR are initially broadly expressed across the epiblast. We therefore propose that to establish robust neural or neural crest transcriptional signatures, ectodermal cells first require the downregulation of epiblast modules.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Spatially restricted co-expression of genes at the NPB</title><p>Dynamic modelling of gene expression reveals that although so-called NPB specifiers are initially co-expressed, they later become enriched in neural, neural crest or placodal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> ).

GM9-13 and GM16-17 are characteristic for neural cells with different A-P identities.

GM16 is enriched within mid-hindbrain clusters and expresses known mid-hindbrain markers <italic>Sp5</italic> and <italic>Nkx6-2</italic>; this module also exhibits low levels of expression in other neural clusters, but importantly, is downregulated in the neural crest.

This shift from broad to restricted co-expression suggests that ectodermal fate segregate between HH7 and ss8.

We term cells which co-express alternative fate gene modules ‘Border-Located Undecided Progenitors’ (BLUPs).</p><p>Overall, our co-expression analysis highlights that BLUPs are transcriptionally undecided and co-express gene modules that characterise alternative ectodermal fates. This expression profile is likely to endow them with the potential to give rise to different NPB fates. Thus, while the NPB demarcates an anatomical region surrounding the neural plate, it lacks a unique transcriptional signature. We propose that undecided NPB progenitors are better defined based on the co-expression of alternate gene modules. The proportion of these cells decreases over time, but a small population at ss4 retains this characteristic and is therefore likely to retain bi- or multipotency even as the neural tube closes.

At HH6, GM12 is downregulated in the NPB and remains confined to the PPR clusters until ss8. Unlike GM12, GM14 is initially restricted to the PPR and only activated in the pNPB at HH7. At ss4 and ss8 its expression is confined to the PPR, with a higher expression in anterior cells. This module contains pan-placodal genes <italic>Dlx5/6</italic> as well as anterior markers <italic>Six3</italic> and <italic>Pax6</italic>. GM13 is the last placodal module to be activated and contains the definitive placodal transcripts <italic>Six1</italic> and <italic>Eya2</italic>. It is first expressed at low levels at HH6 before being broadly activated across the PPR at HH7 through to ss8. We also observe weaker expression of this module at the NPB cells at HH7. To visualise the sequential activation of these modules across latent time, gene expression of each cell was weighted based on its placodal fate probability. This analysis shows that GM12 is activated before GM14 and GM13 in latent time. Whilst the expression of GM12 and GM14 does not change dramatically, GM13 is highly upregulated over latent time within the placodal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>The four neural crest gene modules each contain <italic>bona fide</italic> neural crest transcriptional regulators including <italic>Msx1</italic>, <italic>Zic1</italic>, <italic>Zeb2</italic>, <italic>Lmx1b</italic> (GM40), <italic>Pax7</italic>, <italic>Snai2</italic>, <italic>Axud1</italic>, <italic>Foxd3</italic>, <italic>Tfap2b</italic>, <italic>Sox9</italic> (GM42), <italic>Sox5</italic>, <italic>Id1/2</italic> (GM44) and <italic>Sox10</italic>, <italic>Ets1</italic>, <italic>Lmo4</italic> and <italic>Sox8</italic> (GM43) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>). Our analysis groups these factors unbiasedly into four modules; modelling their expression across latent time weighted by neural crest fate probability shows a clear sequential activation from GM40 to GM42, GM44, and GM43 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). GM40 is activated first, initially broadly across aPPR and pNPB clusters at HH5 and HH6, before becoming restricted to neural crest and NPB clusters from HH7 onwards. By ss8, it is downregulated in the delaminating neural crest population. GM42 and GM44 are highly upregulated only in neural crest and delaminating neural crest cells, with GM42 first expressed at HH7 and GM44 at ss4. Lastly, GM44 is activated specifically within the delaminating neural crest cells at ss4 where it is further upregulated at ss8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). This order suggests a hierarchical relationship between these factors in the neural crest gene regulatory network.</p><p>While gene module selection was based on prior knowledge of marker genes, this analysis also allows us to predict novel factors with similar expression profiles.

However, our understanding as to how individual cells undergo cell fate decisions has been limited by our inability to study transcription and gene regulation at a single cell level.</p><p>In this study, we characterise ectodermal cellular heterogeneity from primitive streak stages though to late neurulation in chick. We demonstrate that although transcriptional differences are apparent between cells at primitive streak stages, due to high levels of heterogeneity, cells do not cluster into discrete cell states until early neurulation (HH7). Instead, cell states are initially characterised by the overlapping expression of broad early neural and non-neural genes, as well as axial markers. We identify increased cell state diversification during neurulation, with neural, neural crest and placodal fates segregating from 1-somite to 8-somite stages. During this process subsets of cells continue to co-express neural, neural crest and placodal gene modules suggesting that they retain a broad developmental potential. Although single-cell lineage tracing and functional experiments are required to validate multipotency of cells at the NPB, the co-expression of competing gene modules appears to be characteristic of cells in an undecided state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Soldatov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Subkhankulova et al., 2023</xref>).

Our unbiased gene module analysis has identified groups of genes which are specifically upregulated within each cell type, broadly supporting these networks. <italic>Pax7</italic>, <italic>Tfap2b</italic>, <italic>Snai2,</italic> and <italic>Sox10</italic> cluster together and are upregulated in neural crest states, while <italic>Six1</italic>, <italic>Eya2</italic>, <italic>Gata2/3,</italic> and <italic>Dlx5/6</italic> are activated within placodal and <italic>Lmo1</italic> and <italic>Sox21</italic> in neural states. Furthermore, we uncover the order of molecular events as ectodermal cells diverge: placodal gene modules are activated first followed by neural and neural crest modules. These findings suggest that these cell states are emerge in that order. However, we also highlight developmental asynchrony between progenitors within each cell lineage. Although we classify placodal cells as early as HH5, transcriptionally undecided BLUPs can still be identified at ss4. These observations propose that cell fate allocation at the NPB is a gradual process, with the number of undecided progenitors decreasing over time as they commit to a given lineage.</p><p>Alongside characterising placodal, neural, and neural crest gene modules, we observe the expression of two modules which exhibit initial broad pan-epiblast expression at primitive streak stages, but which are confined to non-neural cell states at the 4 and 8-somite stages. Within these epiblast modules, unsurprisingly we note the expression of important placodal and non-neural genes <italic>Tfap2c</italic>, <italic>Homer2</italic> and the BMP inhibitor <italic>Bambi</italic>. In addition, we also find the pluripotency marker <italic>Sall4</italic> and <italic>Tspan13</italic>, with the latter shown to be positively regulated by Six1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mehdizadeh et al., 2021</xref>). A recent study in chick shows that a ‘pre-border’ state can already be defined prior to gastrulation based on transcriptional profiling, while in vitro experiments reveal that the pre-gastrula epiblast is specified as NPB. Once cells have acquired a ‘pre-border’ state they can become neural, neural crest and placodal precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Trevers et al., 2018</xref>). Given that the expression of epiblast modules becomes confined to the placodes later, we speculate that the development of the neural crest and neural fates requires the downregulation of the epiblast signatures prior to the activation of neural and neural crest modules.</p><sec id="s3-1-1"><title>Co-expression of competing gene modules defines NPB cells</title><p>The NPB has largely been viewed as a unique territory where neural and non-neural gene expression overlaps and cells are defined by a distinct transcriptional signature. If this indeed is so, NPB markers should be uniformly expressed in NPB cells which subsequently give rise to neural and non-neural ectoderm, neural crest and placode precursors. Members of Zic, Tfap2, Pax, Msx, and Dlx transcription factor families have previously been identified as so-called NPB ‘specifiers’ based on functional experiments that showed them to be necessary for the formation of neural crest cells, placode precursors or both (for review: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stundl et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Thiery et al., 2020</xref>). However, their expression is not uniform in the ectoderm surrounding the neural plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Basch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McLarren et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rothstein and Simoes-Costa, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Streit and Stern, 1999</xref>).

Our analysis extends these data and reveals that indeed none of the so-called NPB specifiers encompasses all cells located at the border of the neural plate and that the NPB cannot be defined by a unique transcriptional signature.</p><p>Here, we show that the NPB is an ectodermal territory surrounding the neural plate that contains cells with heterogeneous combinations of gene expression. These cells are characterised by the co-expression of gene modules which regulate the specification of alternative cell fates suggesting that they are undecided progenitors. Whether BLUPs are truly multipotent remains to be elucidated as do the molecular mechanism that control how conflicting transcriptional signatures are ultimately resolved.</p><p>While NPB cells at early stages can be defined by the co-expression of neural and non-neural modules with some subdivision along the anterior-posterior axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), cell states become more heterogeneous as the neural plate is firmly established. By the 1 somite stage, there is a clear heterogeneity that reflects potential fate choices along the anterior-posterior axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Our co-expression analysis reveals that at the 4-somite stage, cells co-express placodal and forebrain modules, but not neural crest modules. In contrast, other cells co-express neural and neural crest, but not placodal modules, while a small subset of cells at the branching point between neural crest and placodes co-express modules characteristic for all three ectodermal fates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that not only are cells in the NPB transcriptionally heterogeneous with respect to their medial-lateral position, but that multiple hierarchies of choices must exist depending on cell location along the anterior-posterior axis.</p><p>In summary, rather than considering the NPB as a unique territory of equivalent cells it should be viewed as a region of ectoderm surrounding the developing neural plate, where cells of undecided fates reside.</p></sec><sec id="s3-1-2"><title>A probabilistic model for cell fate allocation at the neural plate border</title><p>The ‘binary competence’ and ‘neural plate border’ models have provided useful frameworks for understanding cell fate determination during neural, neural crest and placodal segregation from ‘undecided’ precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>) (for review: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schlosser, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schlosser, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Thiery et al., 2020</xref>). Both models agree that the neural plate is initially surrounded by a territory containing progenitors for all ectodermal fates. The binary competence model suggests a specific sequence of progressive fate restriction shortly thereafter, with cells first becoming restricted to either neural (neural/neural crest) or non-neural (placodal/epidermal) fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahrens and Schlosser, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pieper et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maharana and Schlosser, 2018</xref>). In contrast, the neural plate border model does not imply a specific order of fate decisions, but rather proposes that cells at the border remain multi-potent and can differentiate into all ectodermal fates without suggesting a specific order of choices or binary choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bronner-Fraser and Fraser, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Roellig et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Streit and Stern, 1999</xref>). So far, the lack of experiments analysed at single cell resolution has precluded to resolve these apparently contrasting models. However, recent data from chick point to a transcriptional heterogeneity of NBP cells that cannot be accounted for in these models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Roellig et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Williams et al., 2022</xref>). Our data provide a different perspective highlighting both cell state heterogeneity at the NPB and heterogeneity in the order and type of fate decisions encountered by NPB cells, as well as suggesting that fate decisions occur over a prolonged period and that spatial location of individual cells plays a critical role for their destination.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Probabilistic border model resolves conflicting models of lineage segregation at the neural plate border.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustrating the neural plate border model.

For example, misexpression of the placodal factor Six1 promotes other placodal markers, while repressing neural and neural-crest-specific gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brugmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Christophorou et al., 2009</xref>). Likewise, misexpression of Sox2 or Pax7 can shift proportional assignment of neural and neural crest fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Roellig et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, we find that not only individual genes previously thought to be ‘fate specific’, but whole gene modules overlap widely at early developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) with many individual cells co-expressing markers for all ectodermal derivatives until at least head fold stages. While the number of such cells decreases over time, they continue to be found at predicted lineage branchpoints at ss4. It is widely assumed that co-expression of competing transcriptional programmes indicates that cells have not undergone a terminal fate decision remaining ‘undecided’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Soldatov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Subkhankulova et al., 2023</xref>). The fact that BLUPs can still be identified at neurulation stages (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Roellig et al., 2017</xref>) suggests that cell fate allocation at the NPB is a long drawn-out process that does not occur simultaneously in all cells.</p><p>In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, transplantation experiments carried out at definitive neural plate stages proposed that the neural plate has lost competence to generate placode precursors, while the ectoderm has lost the ability to produce central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahrens and Schlosser, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pieper et al., 2012</xref>). These experiments have led to the dual competence model, which suggests that by this stage the ectoderm is subdivided into neural/neural crest versus placode/epidermal domains and that this represents the first step in ectodermal fate segregation. In support of this, we show that around the 1 somite stage ectodermal cells fall into two ‘superclusters’ with neural/neural crest and placode/epidermal signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, we also find that cells continue to co-express neural, neural crest and placodal modules at mid-hindbrain levels even at the 4ss. Thus, even long after competence is supposedly restricted, cells continue to be transcriptionally undecided suggesting that there is no strict segregation. In addition, we observe that at forebrain levels, where no neural crest cells arise, individual cells co-express neural and placodal modules arguing against a strict restriction of neural and non-neural fates by neural plate stages.</p><p>While the persistence of undecided progenitor cells at late developmental stages supports the neural plate border model, our single-cell RNAseq data together with our spatial analysis of gene expression suggests a more complex scenario. Modelling and measuring gene expression across the medial-lateral axis of the NBP reveals graded co-expression of gene modules and individual transcription factors, respectively. Cells at the medial edge of the NPB express higher levels of neural crest modules or factors, while those at the lateral edge express higher levels of placodal modules or factors. In contrast, cells located in the middle of the NPB generally co-express intermediate levels of both. We therefore propose a probabilistic model for cell fate allocation at the NPB which considers levels of gene expression and the position of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). According to this model medial NPB cells are more likely to generate neural crest and neural cells while lateral NPB cells have the propensity to produce epidermis and placodal derivatives. In contrast, cells in the centre of the NPB retain multipotency and continue to be in an undecided state with equal possibility to give rise to all four ectodermal derivatives. Our probabilistic model does not argue in favour of the dual competence or neural plate border model but highlights cell state heterogeneity and the importance to consider timing and spatial location. Ultimately, we will need to combine single-cell sequencing and lineage tracing to evaluate different modes of fate allocation.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data collection and alignment</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Single cell dissociation and 10X single-cell mRNA sequencing</title><p>Fertilised chicken (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>) eggs (Stewart, Norfolk UK) were incubated at 38 °C for 24–32 hr depending upon the developmental stage collected.

Data from the first batch has previously been used for the characterisation of neural induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Trevers et al., 2023</xref>) (ArrayExpress accession number: E-MTAB-10408).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-2"><title>Read alignment</title><p>A custom pipeline was developed in Nextflow (v20.07.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Di Tommaso et al., 2017</xref>) to handle all GTF processing and read alignment whilst maintaining full reproducibility.</p><p>Prior to scRNAseq alignment, the GalGal6 ensembl 97 GTF file was modified to prefix genes from the Z and W sex chromosomes with their respective chromosome IDs (Z- and W-). Furthermore, we noticed several mitochondrial genes in the GTF were missing their chromosome ID, in turn preventing accurately calculating cell percentage mitochondrial content downstream; mitochondrial genes were therefore also prefixed in the GTF (MT-). Finally, we annotated the key neural crest specifier Snai2 in the GTF (ENSGALG00000030902). Reads were processed and aligned to GalGal6 using CellRanger 4.0.0 (10x Genomics).</p><p>The aligned reads from CellRanger (BAM) were re-counted using Velocyto (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">La Manno et al., 2018</xref>) to generate spliced and unspliced counts for each gene, which are used in subsequent RNA velocity analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Downstream pre-processing</title><p>All downstream analysis was wrapped into a custom Nextflow pipeline to simplify re-running the analysis by handling parallel processing of data subsets.</p><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Data filtering</title><p>Quality control, data filtering, cell clustering, dimensionality reduction and initial data visualisation was carried out using Seurat v4.0.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hao et al., 2021</xref>). First, genes expressed in fewer than five cells were removed from the dataset. Next, to ensure the removal of poor-quality cells whilst also minimising over-filtering, we first applied a medium filtering threshold (cells expressing fewer than 1000 genes, more than 6500 genes, or had more than 15% mitochondrial content were excluded from subsequent analysis) followed by the removal of remaining poor-quality cell clusters.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Dimensionality reduction and clustering</title><p>Linear dimensionality reduction was carried out using principal component analysis (PCA). The number of principal components (PCs) used to construct the subsequent shared-nearest-neighbour (SNN) graph was determined unbiasedly, using an approach developed by the Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://hbctraining.github.io/scRNA-seq/lessons/elbow_plot_metric.html">https://hbctraining.github.io/scRNA-seq/lessons/elbow_plot_metric.html</ext-link>). First, we calculate the PC at which subsequent PCs contribute less than 5% of standard deviation, and the point where the cumulative variation of PCs exceeds 90%. The larger of these two values is selected. Second, we calculate the PC where the inclusion of consecutive PCs contributes less than 0.1% additional variation. The smaller value from these two steps is selected as a cut-off.</p><p>Louvain clustering was carried out with varying resolutions depending upon the data subset in question. A high clustering resolution (resolution = 2) was used to identify poor quality clusters and contaminating cell states. This was to ensure that only poor-quality cells were filtered from the dataset. All other clustering was carried out using a resolution of 0.5.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Filtering of poor-quality clusters</title><p>Cell quality was measured using unique gene and UMI counts.

To avoid over-correction and removal of stage differences, we integrated the data from the two sequencing batches using STACAS v1.1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andreatta and Carmona, 2021</xref>). This R package allows for alignment of datasets containing partially overlapping cell states.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-5"><title>Regressing out confounding variables</title><p>Before downstream analysis, we regressed out percentage mitochondrial content, cell sex, and cell cycle. After regressing out percentage mitochondrial content, we identified a residual sex effect whereby cells clustered according to the expression of either W or Z chromosome genes. This resulted in a duplication of cell clusters, most apparent at HH4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). Cells were k-means clustered according to their expression of W chromosome genes and classified as either male or female. This classification was used to regress out cell sex. Cell cycle was observed to have a strong effect on cell clustering and was therefore also regressed out during data scaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-6"><title>Removal of contaminating clusters</title><p>We found small contaminating clusters of primordial germ cells, blood islands, mesoderm, and endoderm within the dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>). To semi-unbiasedly remove these clusters, we calculated the average expression of candidate markers for each of these cell states and removed clusters in which the median expression of any of these modules was greater than the 90th percentile relative to the rest of the dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F’’</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Downstream analysis</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Unbiased cell classification</title><p>Cell states were classified on each stage independently using a binary knowledge matrix (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). First, the full dataset was split by stage and then re-scaled and re-clustered as described above. Our binary knowledge matrix consists of binarized expression of 76 genes across 24 cell states. For each gene, published in situ hybridisation expression patterns were used to determine expression within each defined cell state. Given that gene expression can vary dramatically between stages, and some cell states are known to not be present at specific timepoints (i.e. delaminating neural crest at HH4), we restricted the possible cell states at specific stages. At HH4, there were seven possible cell states, including non-neural ectoderm (NNE), node, streak, extra-embryonic (EE), early NPB (eNPB), early neural (eN), early caudal neural (eCN). At HH5, there were 17 potential states, this included all cell states in the binary knowledge matrix, except for the later counterparts to the earlier cell states which are ventral forebrain (vFB), forebrain (FB), midbrain (MB), hindbrain (HB), neural crest (NC), delaminating neural crest (dNC) and presumptive epidermis (pEpi). At HH6, we included the same cell states as HH5 except for EE and eNPB given that no cell clusters were classified as such at HH5. For stages HH7, ss4 and ss8 we included 17 cell states, excluding the following states which are only found at earlier stages (NNE, node, streak, eN, eCN, eNPB, EE).</p><p>For each cell, we calculated the average scaled expression of the genes expressed in each cell state according to our binary knowledge matrix. Cell clusters were then assigned a cell state, depending on which cell state exhibited the highest median expression in that given cell cluster. Assigned cell states at each of the six sampled developmental stages were then transferred to the full dataset.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Gene module identification and filtering</title><p>To calculate groups of highly correlated genes, we first filtered genes which do not correlate (Spearman correlation &lt;0.3) with at least three other genes. Then we calculated gene modules using the Antler R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Delile et al., 2019</xref>), which iteratively clusters genes hierarchically based on their gene-gene Spearman correlation. After each iteration, gene modules were filtered to remove gene modules which are not highly expressed (expressed in fewer than 10 cells) or which do not show consistent high expression across genes (fewer than 40% of genes in the module are expressed after binarization). Gene modules were calculated on different subsets of cells: the full dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), ss8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and the NPB subset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Calculating gene modules on different subsets allowed us to zoom in on specific aspects of ectodermal lineage segregation.</p><p>Many genes correlate across the dataset, but do not show differential expression between cell states and therefore do not provide useful information regarding lineage segregation. Therefore, to identify which gene modules correlate with lineage segregation, modules were filtered to only include those in which more than 50% of their genes were differentially expressed (logFC &gt;0.5, adjusted p-value &lt;0.001) in at least one cell state relative to the rest of the dataset. For the NPB subset, this filtering of differential expression was just between the neural crest (NC, dNC) and placodal (aPPR, pPPR, PPR) states rather than between all cell states (logFC &gt;0.25, adjusted p-value &lt;0.001).</p><p>To remove gene modules which correlate with technical variation, we filtered those in which more than 50% their genes showed differential expression between sequencing batches (logFC &gt;0.25, adjusted p-value &lt;0.001).</p><p>For the gene modules calculated on the full dataset, we were particularly interested in gene modules that segregated into one of the three lineages (neural, neural crest or placodal) at later stages. To focus our analysis on these gene modules, we applied an additional filtering step to only keep gene modules in which more than 50% of genes were differentially expressed between one of the three lineages at ss8 (logFC &gt;0.25, adjusted p-value &lt;0.001). After filtering 9 gene modules remained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). Modules were further manually filtered for visualisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>For the gene modules calculated on the NPB subset we wanted to focus on the co-expression and sequential activation of gene modules that contain well-characterised neural crest and PPR markers. We therefore further filtered NPB gene modules to include only those that had genes that were defined within neural crest, delaminating neural crest or PPR cell states in the binary knowledge matrix. After this final filtering step, 7 gene modules remained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Co-expression visualisation</title><p>The average normalised expression of each gene module was scaled between 0 and 1. A 100x100 two-colour matrix was created using Seurat’s BlendMatrix function. Each cell was assigned a colour from this matrix based on their scaled average expression of the gene modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C, D and E</xref>).

Velocyto matrices were intersected with each of the data subsets generated in Seurat. First and second order moments were then calculated for each cell across its 20 nearest neighbours using the top 20 PCs. RNA velocity was ran using the dynamical model whilst accounting for differential kinetics; this allows for differential splicing rates between genes as well as differential splicing kinetics between cell states.</p><p>Latent time was calculated using scVelo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bergen et al., 2020</xref>) with the diffusion weighting parameter set to 0.2. When calculating latent time, the root cell was calculated from cells belonging to the earliest timepoint present in the data; when analysing cells from individual stage subsets, no rooting population was specified. For all latent time estimates, we used a diffusion weighting of 0.2.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-6"><title>Modelling gene expression dynamics</title><p>Lineage inference was calculated using CellRank, which uses a probabilistic approach to assign cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lange et al., 2022</xref>). Cell transition matrices were calculated using RNA velocity (0.8 weighting) and nearest neighbour graph (0.2 weighting) kernels. A softmax scale of 4 was set to prevent transitions tending towards orthogonality. When predicting cell transitions, terminal states were specified according to the lineages which we were wanting to model gene dynamics across. For the full dataset, we predicted cell transitions towards either neural, placodal or neural crest lineages. Terminal states were specified as: delaminating neural crest and neural crest cell states at ss4 and ss8 for the neural crest lineage; hindbrain, midbrain, and forebrain cell states at ss4 and ss8 for the neural lineage; anterior PPR, posterior PPR and PPR cell states at ss4 and ss8 for the placodal lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). For our NPB subset, we predicted cell transitions towards either placodal or neural crest lineages, with terminal states specified as: delaminating neural crest and neural crest cell states at ss8 for the neural crest lineage; aPPR and PPR cell states at ss8 for the placodal lineage. The output of CellRank was the probability that any given cell would differentiate towards any of the terminal states. The lineage absorption probability is represented as a decimal between 0 and 1, with the sum of all lineage absorption probabilities for any given cell equal to 1.</p><p>Gene expression dynamics were calculated by fitting generalised additive models (GAMs), which modelled average normalised gene expression as a function of latent time using the mgcv package in R. Negative binomial distributions were fitted using a log link function and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for visualisation. Lineage absorption probability obtained from CellRank were used to weight a GAM for each of the predicted lineages. To generate a smoothed prediction of gene expression change, a cubic spline was fitted with knots = 4. When modelling the dynamics of entire gene modules, all genes within a given module were included in the GAM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-7"><title>Modelling mediolateral gene expression patterns from scRNAseq data</title><p>Following principal component analysis of cells at HH7, the order of cell states across the inverse of PC 1 were found to reflect the M-L positioning of cells in vivo.

Embryos were fixed in 4% PFA for 1 hr at room temperature, dehydrated in a series of methanol in PBT, and stored overnight at –20 °C. Samples were rehydrated and treated with proteinase-K for 3 min (20 mg/mL). Next samples were post-fixed in 4% PFA for 20 min and sequentially washed on ice for 5 min in PBS, 1:1 PBT/5×SSC (5×sodium chloride sodium citrate, 0.1% Tween-20), and 5×SSC. Samples were then pre-hybridised in hybridisation buffer for 5 min on ice, followed by 30 min at 37 °C. Next, samples were hybridised overnight at 37 °C with HCR probes in hybridisation buffer (4 pmol/mL). Excess probe was washed off with 15 min washes in probe wash buffer at 37 °C, before preamplification in amplification buffer at room temperature for 5 min. Hairpins (30 pmol) were incubated at 95 °C for 90 s and left to cool to room temperature for 30 min before being added to the amplification buffer. Samples were then incubated with the hairpin/amplification buffer solution overnight at room temperature. Excess hairpins were washed off with two 5 min and two 30 min washes in 5×SSC. After a 5 min incubation in DAPI (10 mg/mL), samples were washed 3 times for 10 min in 5×SSC before being imaged using a Leica SP5 laser scanning confocal inverted microscope using the LAS AF software.</p><p>Intensity measurements were calculated by taking the sum of slices from the image Z-stacks taken at three anteroposterior levels in ImageJ. The three intensity measurements were then independently scaled (Z-score) for each gene to allow relative measurements of gene expression across the anteroposterior axis. Transverse virtual sections across the anteroposterior axis were obtained using the Imaris 9.3.1 software. 10 μm sections were generated with the orthogonal slice tool.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Software, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Supervision, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Binary knowledge matrix used for unbiased cell state classification.</title><p>This matrix was established by binarizing the expression of 76 genes across 24 putative cell states based on in situ hybridisation expression patterns obtained from the literature.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-82717-supp1-v2.csv" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="octet-stream"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-82717-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>10x single cell RNAseq was carried out in two batches and is available under two separate accession numbers (ArrayExpress: E-MTAB-10408 and E-MTAB-1144).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kathryn Cheah as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Gerhard Schlosser (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The Reviewers had major concerns about the language used to describe your results, your terminology, the interpretations of your findings, and the claims made about the significance of your study. The Reviewers felt that for your claims to be substantiated as written, you would have to perform additional proof-of-concept experiments and confirmatory analyses. Theoretically, these would include new gain- and loss-of-function experiments, lineage tracing analyses, and heterotopic transplantations.</p><p>However, given that your submission constitutes a Tools and Resources manuscript and not a Research Article, we are not asking you to perform additional experiments. Instead, the Reviewers are asking you to take very seriously all their other their requests (major and minor) for a substantial revision of the abstract and text, and a reanalysis of some of the data as detailed and described in each of their Recommendations sections.</p><p>2. Specifically, we are asking you to revise your manuscript to address what the Reviewers identify as conceptual problems with the interpretation of your data, unsubstantiated claims about the significance of your results, insufficient discussion of other similar previous studies/lineage tracing experiments, and highly speculative conclusions. For example, the Reviewers take issue with your use of the term BLUPs for transcriptionally unstable cells and your suggestion of a gradient model that they feel lacks molecular evidence. The Reviewers have also asked you to define and use terms like commitment, specification, etc. with more precision. Other concerns like these, which we are asking you to address in your revision, are detailed in each of their Recommendations sections.</p><p>3. The Reviewers would like you to add an analysis of the co-expression and segregation dynamics between gene modules for all four ectodermal cell fates (epidermis, placodes, neural crest, neural plate). The Reviewers think this would strengthen the value of your paper.</p><p>4. We feel that you should use a different title to reflect the fact that the work is a Tools and Resources manuscript and not a Research Article (which is typically focused on the functional testing of a specific hypothesis). To facilitate the discovery and re-use of your resource, we think your title should instead emphasize the system and methods used and the nature of your dataset.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>To substantiate the claim that cells expressing significant numbers of genes associated with two or more neural plate border lineages retain multi-lineage plasticity (e.g., able to give rise to neural crest and placode derivatives), the authors would at a minimum need to perform lineage tracing. I realize this is not easy in chick embryos, but without such tests, the impressive amount of data and analysis in the paper only makes predictions but does not test them. The authors should revise the text throughout their manuscript to explain these caveats and limitations of their study. For instance, in their Introduction, the authors speak of previous models of border specification and state &quot;They [ the previous studies] therefore do not address how individual cells at the NBP make decisions, nor whether they are multipotent or a population of mixed progenitors that are already biased towards their later identity&quot;. The present study does not really address this question either. To give one example, the authors suggest that defined placodal progenitors emerge earlier than neural crest cells. At HH7, do the remaining BLUPs have the potential to give rise to neural crest AND placodes, (to take an extreme), do they all give rise to neural crest despite still expressing some placodal genes? Put another way, how can we tell when the presence of heterogeneity is biologically significant? This should all be addressed in the text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have two suggestions for revision:</p><p>First, I think the predictions of the &quot;binary competence model&quot; (sequence of cell-fate decisions: [neural or neural crest]-[epidermal or placodal]) and &quot;neural plate border state model&quot; (sequence of cell fate decisions: neural-[placodal or neural crest]-epidermal) should be highlighted and it should be discussed to what extent the findings of the current study support one or the other model. Most of the data presented by Thiery et al. suggest that cell fate decisions at the NPB occur as predicted by the binary competence model: While placodal cells cluster with epidermal cells, neural crest cells cluster with neural plate cells. Moreover, Figure 4 suggests that the genes of their placodal gene modules are also expressed in epidermal cells but not in the neural plate or neural crest (and – less clearly – neural crest modules are also weakly expressed in the neural plate but not in other ectodermal cells and vice versa). The findings of this paper also support the proposal of the binary competence model that the NPB is an area of indecision that decreases in size over time rather than being defined by its own regulatory state (see in particular Schlosser, 2014). Since neural and epidermal cells are also included in the dataset of this study (except for somite stage 8, where unfortunately no epidermal cells were included), the data could also be used to test the predictions of binary competence and neural plate border state model more directly, by analysing the co-expression and segregation dynamics between gene modules for all four ectodermal cell fates (epidermis, placodes, neural crest, neural plate). In other words: is the increasing segregation of placodal and neural crest gene modules initially accompanied by a co-segregation of epidermal with placodal and of the neural plate with neural crest modules? Such an analysis could help to resolve a long-standing controversy and would strengthen the value of this paper even further.</p><p>Second, the issues raised regarding the sequence of specification of the different ectodermal fates should be discussed in light of previous experiments of specification and possible species-specific differences as indicated in my public review.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors describe the neural plate border (NPB) as a transient territory within the neural plate itself, that contains precursors of the neural plate, neural crest, neural placodes, and epidermis. It's not clear to me whether this is the authors' own specific definition for the avian model they are using or if this is a generally accepted definition that applies to both amniotes and anamniotes.</p><p>The authors could better define when they think the NPB is truly established for comparisons with other species. I say this because the authors conclude that the NPB should be recognized as an anatomical region of the ectoderm rather than a transcriptional state. But the problem is many embryologists have always regarded the NPB as an anatomical region at the junction between neural and non-neural ectoderm, which is identifiable histologically.</p><p>I think a major oversight of the authors' work is not considering it in conjunction with the wealth of lineage-tracing experiments. For example, Bronner Fraser and Fraser (1989) showed through single-cell lineage tracing that a single neural plate cell in a chicken embryo, even at the time the neural tube is closed will give rise to cells that stay in the CNS while also generating neural crest cells. Furthermore, Moury and Jacobson (1990) showed that both neural plate and epidermis which can be morphologically distinguished, dissected from the neural plate border of donor embryos, and transplanted into host embryos, in each case will give rise to neural crest cells. This and other classic data reveal a lot about the potential of neural plate border cells, their ultimate fates and also the developmental time when lineage segregation and cell fate determination occurs. The authors should consider their data and model in light of lineage labeling experiments performed in the Garcia-Castro lab (Basch et al., 2006; Prasad et al., 2020).</p><p>In addition, when the dorsal neural folds are ablated, neural crest cells are formed from more ventromedial territories, domains that would appear to violate the authors' segregated NPB domains. Finally, neural crest cells that have already migrated can be transplanted back into the neural plate and give rise to dorsal CNS, or ventral CNS depending on the transplant location, or ultimately migrate again as neural crest cells. I think what all of these studies show, in concert with the rich transcriptional data set the authors have generated, is the considerable heterogeneity of gene expression in NBP cells and their incredible plasticity, which remains for a considerable period of developmental time.</p><p>The transcriptional dataset is very rich and will be of value to the field, but I think the authors' overall conclusions are not supported by their data.</p><p>The authors make a lot of claims, and naturally much of it has to be quite speculative because its based purely on gene expression or co-expression with genes of known spatiotemporal activity and function. Unfortunately, the bulk of validation is attributed to correlative expression of already well-studied factors which demarcate neural cells from neural crest cells from placode cells from epidermis cells. Despite a lot of data, we learn very little about any new genes and their potential roles in driving the process of specification, lineage selection, and cell fate determination because there's no functional data or test. The authors need to be more forthcoming about the speculative nature of their claims and conclusions.</p><p>The authors describe a group of cells as bipotential lineage unstable progenitors (BLUPs), based on the supposition that the cells are transcriptionally unstable. This terminology is a complete misnomer and the authors provide no evidence of transcript instability in these cells. I recommend the authors research the molecular biology literature to appreciate what transcriptional instability really means. What the authors have identified is a limited pool of cells that are bipotential lineage progenitors.</p><p>The authors propose a gradient border model for cell fate choice at the neural plate border, but again the choice of word is inaccurate, and because the authors provide no evidence of a gradient in the standard biological sense. This renders the title of the paper incorrect. Perhaps the authors intended to say graded or sequential with reference to the timing of the process. Nonetheless, the schematic summary figure appears to be consistent in principle with the single-cell sequencing data and analysis performed in frog embryos and published in Briggs et al. 2018.</p><p>Other concerns/comments:</p><p>Inaccurate statements such as that on page 2…&quot;neural crest cells are largely incorporated into the neural folds&quot;… makes no anatomical sense. How can a cell that doesn't exist yet be incorporated into a tissue from which it will delaminate? Perhaps the authors meant neural crest cell progenitors?</p><p>Much of the regionalization description was very limited and again a lot of assumptions were based on relatively few genes. For example, the expression of Hoxb1 was noted but apart from expression in distinct cell groups what did the authors glean from its activity? Did the authors consider in their analyses that the anterior is slightly older than the posterior when it comes to interpreting when lineage segregation and cell fate determination occurs?</p><p>The authors conclude on page 9 that their analysis predicts that cells move away from cluster boundaries towards definitive cell states, and then on page 11 that neural crest probabilities are only high in late cells reflecting that those defined neural crest cell clusters appear at HH7. But isn't this consistent with what we already know from lineage tracing of neural crest cells in avian embryos? In any case, the sequential combinatorial activation and downregulation of gene expression the authors describe is consistent with key known markers for each of the different lineages but the authors have defined this at a much higher resolution which is a valuable resource for the community.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;scRNA-sequencing in chick suggests a probabilistic model for cell fate allocation at the neural plate border&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Kathryn Cheah (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In the revised manuscript, the authors have addressed many of the issues raised by myself and the other two reviewers. In particular, they are now more careful in their terminology in relation to specification (my major second point of criticism). However, in the legend of Figure 6, BLUPs are still called &quot;unstable&quot; rather than &quot;undecided&quot;. In line 706, they still write &quot;These findings suggest that these cell states are specified in that order&quot;. This should be changed.</p><p>The authors also made efforts to address my first major point of criticism regarding the discussion of previous models of cell fate decisions at the neural plate border. They reworded some of the discussion of these models and included some additional analysis of the coexpression of placodal and neural crest modules with different regions of the neural plate. Unfortunately, their data did not include a sufficient number of epidermal cells, so they could not conduct the additional analysis of the sequence of cell fate decisions that I suggested. While these changes have improved the manuscript, I think that the authors still 1) slightly misrepresent the &quot;binary competence model&quot; and 2) fail to discuss an important limitation of their study. As suggested below, these remaining issues can be remedied with relatively minor adjustments to the manuscript.</p><p>1) As I already wrote in my comments to the first version, a &quot;neural plate border model&quot; that argues that the neural plate border is a region of indecision is compatible with multiple possible models of how cell fate decisions are made at the neural plate border (and in Schlosser, 2014, I specifically propose a model where the NPB is initially characterized as an area of indecision before it resolves into neural and non-neural competence territories). One of these models addressing the sequence of cell fate decisions is the &quot;binary competence model&quot; that we have previously proposed, in which the sequence of cell-fate decisions is [neural or neural crest]-[epidermal or placodal] (as the authors now mention in their introduction). A second possible model, that we discussed (and rejected) as a possible alternative to the binary competence model is a &quot;neural plate border state model&quot; which suggests a sequence of cell fate decisions: neural-[placodal or neural crest]-epidermal (see Schlosser, 2006, 2014). A third possible alternative is a model in which the four different ectodermal territories may be specified by multiple different pathways of cell fate decision that may not show a clear preference for one or the other hierarchy of cell fate decisions (this is what Roellig et al., 2017 appear to be proposing although it is at odds with their own findings, which show different co-expression frequencies for markers of different ectodermal territories).</p><p>Since the &quot;binary competence model&quot; is one of several models addressing the sequence of cell fate decisions at the NPB (all of them compatible with the idea that the NPB may start out as an area of indecision), it is misleading to specifically present the &quot;binary competence model&quot; as the one and only alternative to a &quot;neural plate border&quot; model that suggests &quot;that cells at the border of the neural plate have mixed identity and retain the ability to generate all ectodermal derivatives until after neurulation begins&quot; as the authors write in line 98. Instead, the authors should acknowledge (e.g. in lines 97 and following and in the discussion) that the &quot;binary competence model&quot; has been presented as an alternative to models, which propose a different sequence of cell fate decisions at the NPB, such as neural-[placodal or neural crest]-epidermal.</p><p>2) In the discussion (lines 770 and following) the authors should acknowledge that while their data support a model of the neural plate border as an area of indecision, the lack of data on epidermal cells does not allow them to address the question of whether any particular sequence of cell fate decision at the NPB is more likely than another sequence and, thus, does not allow them to decide between the different possible models regarding the probability of particular sequences of cell fate decision at the neural plate border (such as &quot;binary competence&quot; versus &quot;neural plate border state&quot; model).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82717.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

I realize this is not easy in chick embryos, but without such tests, the impressive amount of data and analysis in the paper only makes predictions but does not test them. The authors should revise the text throughout their manuscript to explain these caveats and limitations of their study. For instance, in their Introduction, the authors speak of previous models of border specification and state &quot;They [ the previous studies] therefore do not address how individual cells at the NBP make decisions, nor whether they are multipotent or a population of mixed progenitors that are already biased towards their later identity&quot;. The present study does not really address this question either.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the review for this helpful comment. We agree that we do not address whether cells at the neural plate border are multipotent and have rephrased this section in the introduction to highlight that the focus of our manuscript is on the heterogeneity of cell fate decisions at the neural plate border.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To give one example, the authors suggest that defined placodal progenitors emerge earlier than neural crest cells. At HH7, do the remaining BLUPs have the potential to give rise to neural crest AND placodes, (to take an extreme), do they all give rise to neural crest despite still expressing some placodal genes? Put another way, how can we tell when the presence of heterogeneity is biologically significant? This should all be addressed in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>The question of validating the biological significance of transcriptional heterogeneity is of primary interest to us but requires single-cell lineage tracing which is technically challenging and beyond the scope of this study. However, we thank the reviewer for this comment as they are correct that multi-potency can only be validated experimentally. We have revisited the manuscript and made sure that references to cell type emergence and cell state heterogeneity are specifically mentioned in the context of transcriptional state and not competence. We have also made clear in the discussion that testing multipotency requires future single cell lineage tracing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have two suggestions for revision:</p><p>First, I think the predictions of the &quot;binary competence model&quot; (sequence of cell-fate decisions: [neural or neural crest]-[epidermal or placodal]) and &quot;neural plate border state model&quot; (sequence of cell fate decisions: neural-[placodal or neural crest]-epidermal) should be highlighted and it should be discussed to what extent the findings of the current study support one or the other model. Most of the data presented by Thiery et al. suggest that cell fate decisions at the NPB occur as predicted by the binary competence model: While placodal cells cluster with epidermal cells, neural crest cells cluster with neural plate cells. Moreover, Figure 4 suggests that the genes of their placodal gene modules are also expressed in epidermal cells but not in the neural plate or neural crest (and – less clearly – neural crest modules are also weakly expressed in the neural plate but not in other ectodermal cells and vice versa). The findings of this paper also support the proposal of the binary competence model that the NPB is an area of indecision that decreases in size over time rather than being defined by its own regulatory state (see in particular Schlosser, 2014). Since neural and epidermal cells are also included in the dataset of this study (except for somite stage 8, where unfortunately no epidermal cells were included), the data could also be used to test the predictions of binary competence and neural plate border state model more directly, by analysing the co-expression and segregation dynamics between gene modules for all four ectodermal cell fates (epidermis, placodes, neural crest, neural plate). In other words: is the increasing segregation of placodal and neural crest gene modules initially accompanied by a co-segregation of epidermal with placodal and of the neural plate with neural crest modules? Such an analysis could help to resolve a long-standing controversy and would strengthen the value of this paper even further.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these suggestions which have helped us to improve the manuscript. While we were unable to carry out pairwise co-expression analysis of gene modules for all four ectodermal fates due to limited epidermal cell availability at later timepoints, we have conducted additional co-expression analysis of placodal-forebrain and neural crest-mid/hindbrain gene modules. Our findings further support our earlier results indicating a high degree of heterogeneity at the neural plate border. Co-expression of different gene modules differs along that antero-posterior axis reflecting the different kind of fate choices cells have and suggesting a different order depending on cell location.</p><p>We acknowledge the usefulness of both the NPB and binary competence models as working hypotheses, but our results suggest that neither model fully accounts for this heterogeneity. We have expanded our Results section to include these additional findings and provided greater clarity in the discussion regarding how our proposed probabilistic model fits within the context of the existing models. We hope that our revised manuscript will better convey our findings and their implications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, the issues raised regarding the sequence of specification of the different ectodermal fates should be discussed in light of previous experiments of specification and possible species-specific differences as indicated in my public review.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above, we have re-worded the text carefully to reflect this comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors describe the neural plate border (NPB) as a transient territory within the neural plate itself, that contains precursors of the neural plate, neural crest, neural placodes, and epidermis. It's not clear to me whether this is the authors' own specific definition for the avian model they are using or if this is a generally accepted definition that applies to both amniotes and anamniotes.</p></disp-quote><p>To provide clarification, it should be noted that the NPB is not considered a territory within the neural plate, but rather a region located at its edge. This term is commonly used in both amniotes and anamniotes, and it is generally accepted that it contains precursors for all four ectodermal derivatives. The appropriate references are given in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors could better define when they think the NPB is truly established for comparisons with other species. I say this because the authors conclude that the NPB should be recognized as an anatomical region of the ectoderm rather than a transcriptional state. But the problem is many embryologists have always regarded the NPB as an anatomical region at the junction between neural and non-neural ectoderm, which is identifiable histologically.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the NPB is an anatomical location and have clarified this in the text. However, it has generally been assumed that cells within the NPB have the same ‘transcriptional state’. Our data show that this assumption is incorrect and NPB cells should be defined molecularly by the co-expression of competing gene modules. Given the heterogeneity in cells located at the boundary of the neural plate, it is not possible to say when the NPB is truly established. Instead, our detailed co-expression analysis highlights that cells within this region express broad graded co-expression of placodal, neural and neural crest modules, with cell fate allocation taking place gradually between neurulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, when the dorsal neural folds are ablated, neural crest cells are formed from more ventromedial territories, domains that would appear to violate the authors' segregated NPB domains. Finally, neural crest cells that have already migrated can be transplanted back into the neural plate and give rise to dorsal CNS, or ventral CNS depending on the transplant location, or ultimately migrate again as neural crest cells. I think what all of these studies show, in concert with the rich transcriptional data set the authors have generated, is the considerable heterogeneity of gene expression in NBP cells and their incredible plasticity, which remains for a considerable period of developmental time.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments and agree that there is a lot of plasticity even at later developmental stages. Indeed, this is supported by our data and the fact that individual cells continue to co-express competing transcriptional programme at quite late stages. Our data do not suggest that cells are ‘committed’ even when they express gene modules characteristic for a specific fate, and we have carefully screened the text to make this clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The transcriptional dataset is very rich and will be of value to the field, but I think the authors' overall conclusions are not supported by their data.</p><p>The authors make a lot of claims, and naturally much of it has to be quite speculative because its based purely on gene expression or co-expression with genes of known spatiotemporal activity and function. Unfortunately, the bulk of validation is attributed to correlative expression of already well-studied factors which demarcate neural cells from neural crest cells from placode cells from epidermis cells. Despite a lot of data, we learn very little about any new genes and their potential roles in driving the process of specification, lineage selection, and cell fate determination because there's no functional data or test. The authors need to be more forthcoming about the speculative nature of their claims and conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that we do not provide any validation of our predictions; it is for this reason that we submitted our work as a resource to make our data available to the community.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors describe a group of cells as bipotential lineage unstable progenitors (BLUPs), based on the supposition that the cells are transcriptionally unstable. This terminology is a complete misnomer and the authors provide no evidence of transcript instability in these cells. I recommend the authors research the molecular biology literature to appreciate what transcriptional instability really means. What the authors have identified is a limited pool of cells that are bipotential lineage progenitors.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that ‘unstable’ was not the correct term to use. As per suggestion of reviewer 2 we have changed this to ‘undecided’. Our data do not tell us anything about ‘potential’ of progenitors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors propose a gradient border model for cell fate choice at the neural plate border, but again the choice of word is inaccurate, and because the authors provide no evidence of a gradient in the standard biological sense. This renders the title of the paper incorrect. Perhaps the authors intended to say graded or sequential with reference to the timing of the process. Nonetheless, the schematic summary figure appears to be consistent in principle with the single-cell sequencing data and analysis performed in frog embryos and published in Briggs et al. 2018.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment and agree that ‘gradient’ was misleading. We have now replaced with graded and expanded Figure 6 to highlight the graded co-expression of gene modules associated with alternate fates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other concerns/comments:</p><p>Inaccurate statements such as that on page 2…&quot;neural crest cells are largely incorporated into the neural folds&quot;… makes no anatomical sense. How can a cell that doesn't exist yet be incorporated into a tissue from which it will delaminate? Perhaps the authors meant neural crest cell progenitors?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for spotting this; we have now modified the statement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Much of the regionalization description was very limited and again a lot of assumptions were based on relatively few genes. For example, the expression of Hoxb1 was noted but apart from expression in distinct cell groups what did the authors glean from its activity? Did the authors consider in their analyses that the anterior is slightly older than the posterior when it comes to interpreting when lineage segregation and cell fate determination occurs?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that we keep the description of anterior-posterior patterning to a minimum; this is not the focus of our paper and we feel that expanding the manuscript to cover this aspect will over-complicate the manuscript and make it even longer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors conclude on page 9 that their analysis predicts that cells move away from cluster boundaries towards definitive cell states, and then on page 11 that neural crest probabilities are only high in late cells reflecting that those defined neural crest cell clusters appear at HH7. But isn't this consistent with what we already know from lineage tracing of neural crest cells in avian embryos? In any case, the sequential combinatorial activation and downregulation of gene expression the authors describe is consistent with key known markers for each of the different lineages but the authors have defined this at a much higher resolution which is a valuable resource for the community.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data suggest show that the NCC transcriptional state arises late and therefore the probability is high late. We are not sure how to relate this to lineage tracing in the embryo.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below.</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In the revised manuscript, the authors have addressed many of the issues raised by myself and the other two reviewers. In particular, they are now more careful in their terminology in relation to specification (my major second point of criticism). However, in the legend of Figure 6, BLUPs are still called &quot;unstable&quot; rather than &quot;undecided&quot;. In line 706, they still write &quot;These findings suggest that these cell states are specified in that order&quot;. This should be changed.</p></disp-quote><p>Apologies, we must have missed this. Now corrected legend and reworded the text to read: “These findings suggest that these cell states are <italic>emerge</italic> in that order.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors also made efforts to address my first major point of criticism regarding the discussion of previous models of cell fate decisions at the neural plate border. They reworded some of the discussion of these models and included some additional analysis of the coexpression of placodal and neural crest modules with different regions of the neural plate. Unfortunately, their data did not include a sufficient number of epidermal cells, so they could not conduct the additional analysis of the sequence of cell fate decisions that I suggested. While these changes have improved the manuscript, I think that the authors still 1) slightly misrepresent the &quot;binary competence model&quot; and 2) fail to discuss an important limitation of their study. As suggested below, these remaining issues can be remedied with relatively minor adjustments to the manuscript.</p><p>1) As I already wrote in my comments to the first version, a &quot;neural plate border model&quot; that argues that the neural plate border is a region of indecision is compatible with multiple possible models of how cell fate decisions are made at the neural plate border (and in Schlosser, 2014, I specifically propose a model where the NPB is initially characterized as an area of indecision before it resolves into neural and non-neural competence territories). One of these models addressing the sequence of cell fate decisions is the &quot;binary competence model&quot; that we have previously proposed, in which the sequence of cell-fate decisions is [neural or neural crest]-[epidermal or placodal] (as the authors now mention in their introduction). A second possible model, that we discussed (and rejected) as a possible alternative to the binary competence model is a &quot;neural plate border state model&quot; which suggests a sequence of cell fate decisions: neural-[placodal or neural crest]-epidermal (see Schlosser, 2006, 2014). A third possible alternative is a model in which the four different ectodermal territories may be specified by multiple different pathways of cell fate decision that may not show a clear preference for one or the other hierarchy of cell fate decisions (this is what Roellig et al., 2017 appear to be proposing although it is at odds with their own findings, which show different co-expression frequencies for markers of different ectodermal territories).</p><p>Since the &quot;binary competence model&quot; is one of several models addressing the sequence of cell fate decisions at the NPB (all of them compatible with the idea that the NPB may start out as an area of indecision), it is misleading to specifically present the &quot;binary competence model&quot; as the one and only alternative to a &quot;neural plate border&quot; model that suggests &quot;that cells at the border of the neural plate have mixed identity and retain the ability to generate all ectodermal derivatives until after neurulation begins&quot; as the authors write in line 98. Instead, the authors should acknowledge (e.g. in lines 97 and following and in the discussion) that the &quot;binary competence model&quot; has been presented as an alternative to models, which propose a different sequence of cell fate decisions at the NPB, such as neural-[placodal or neural crest]-epidermal.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comments of the reviewer; we have now added more detail on the recently revised dual competence model (introduction line 87 onwards; discussion line 762 onwards) to include the proposal from Maharana and Schlosser.</p><p>However, we respectfully disagree with the suggestion that the NPB model suggests a specific sequence of fate decisions: neural-[placodal or neural crest]-epidermal. While this is stated in the 2006 and 2014 reviews, to the best of our knowledge there is no evidence in the literature to support such a sequence of events (including in the papers cited in the reviews). We are therefore puzzled where this proposal comes from. It is for this reason that we are reluctant to state that the NPB model suggests a specific sequence of fate decisions.</p><p>We would like to emphasize that our data do not provide support for either model, but highlight the heterogeneity of cells in the NPB, the fact that cells expressing ‘conflicting’ TF programmes can be found very late even after the time of neural tube closure and that fate decisions themselves are heterogeneous in sequence and place. This is clearly stated in the final section of the discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
