to social signals and their valuation is important in social learning. Here we introduce a task that investigates if mutual reward delivery in male rats can drive associative learning. We found that when actor rats have fully learned a stimulus-self-reward association, adding a cue that predicted additional reward to a partner unblocked associative learning about this cue. By contrast, additional cues that did not predict partner reward remained blocked from acquiring positive associative value. Importantly, this social unblocking effect was still present when controlling for secondary reinforcement but absent when social information exchange was impeded, when mutual reward outcomes were disadvantageously unequal to the actor or when the added cue predicted reward delivery to an empty chamber. Taken together, these results suggest that mutual rewards can drive associative learning in rats and is dependent on vicariously experienced social and food-related cues.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>unblocking</kwd><kwd>vicarious reward</kwd><kwd>associative learning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001663</institution-id><institution>Volkswagen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AZ88216</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Gurp</surname><given-names>Sander</given-names></name><name><surname>Hoog</surname><given-names>Jochen</given-names></name><name><surname>van Wingerden</surname><given-names>Marijn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Rats learn to interpret cues predicting rewards delivered to social partners as valuable, but only if social information exchange is possible.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Humans and other animals have developed a capacity for mutual cooperative behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nowak, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rand and Nowak, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rilling et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Suchak et al., 2014</xref>), a preference for prosocial outcomes to familiar partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hernandez-Lallement et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Horner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Márquez et al., 2015</xref>) and helping behavior toward others in need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ben-Ami Bartal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fehr and Rockenbach, 2004</xref>). These behaviors are sometimes costly, prompting questions why actor rats engage in them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Waal and Suchak, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hamilton, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stevens et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Trivers, 1971</xref>). Some researchers have focused on putative future reciprocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taborsky et al., 2016</xref>) as a potential driver, while others have highlighted that acting generously could generate self-reward internally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harbaugh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Park et al., 2017</xref>) or through positive social reward signals such as friendly faces in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Spreckelmeyer et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, the capacity to identify positive, rewarding outcomes delivered to others is a fundamental aspect of social observational learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zentall, 2012</xref>). Underlying some of these suggestions is the assumption that rewarding outcomes to a social partner could also represent value to oneself and thus drive a proximate reward/learning mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hernandez-Lallement et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ruff and Fehr, 2014</xref>). Using this logic, animals, including humans, choose prosocial outcomes, cooperate or act altruistically because these actions result in vicarious reward, experienced through sensitivity to the behavioral and/or affective state of the partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Waal and Preston, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Prochazkova and Kret, 2017</xref>), in addition to putative anticipated future reciprocal reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taborsky et al., 2016</xref>). One important aspect of social learning is identifying the features of the environment that predict (vicariously) rewarding outcomes, and learning the (instrumental) action sequence, appropriate to the context, for acquiring these vicariously rewarding outcomes. There is evidence that cues that predict social reward can become valuable as humans learn to respond faster to stimuli that become associated with positive social reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jones et al., 2011</xref>) and monkeys preferred stimuli that predicted a reward delivery to a conspecific more than the stimuli that predicted no reward delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2011</xref>). In rats, it was found that observing another rat being rewarded is (vicariously) rewarding by itself as it is accompanied by 50 kHz vocalizations, indicative of a positive appetitive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burgdorf et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Panksepp, 2007</xref>), and dopamine release in the NAcc of the observer rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kashtelyan et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, playback of 50 kHz leads to both an approach response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wöhr and Schwarting, 2007</xref>) and results in dopamine release in the Nucleus Accumbens NAcc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Willuhn et al., 2014</xref>). We, therefore, hypothesized that vicarious reward, associated with rewards delivered to others, could also reinforce Pavlovian associative learning about novel cues, as has been found in the appetitive domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berridge, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schultz, 2016</xref>). To investigate our hypothesis, we use a well-established behavioral paradigm in associative learning called blocking. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kamin, 1969</xref> found, in simple stimulus-outcome association tasks, that if new stimuli are added to a stimulus that already fully predicts a reward, associative learning about those additional stimuli will be blocked. Reinforcement learning about additional stimuli can become unblocked, however, by an increase in reward value or a change in reward identity contingent on the presentation of the new stimuli. This change in value is then thought to be associated with these new stimuli and thus alters their incentive value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holland, 1984</xref>). We hypothesize that rewarding social outcomes, such as sugar pellet deliveries to a partner rat, will also be capable to unblock learning about novel stimuli added in compound, indicative of an increased, partially vicarious value of mutual rewards relative to own-rewards. We tested this hypothesis by adopting a task from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McDannald et al., 2011</xref> where unblocking is operationalized by adding additional pellet deliveries conditional on a second cue presented in compound with a learned cue that already fully predicted reward. We modified this task in such a way that the second cue is now followed by a food reward delivery to a partner rat, rather than increasing one’s reward. In addition, a third control cue added in compound to the learned cue (on different trials) was not followed by food reward delivery to a partner rat. Concretely, we thus hypothesized that associative learning about the second stimulus would become unblocked through a vicarious experience of the partner reward exclusively during mutual reward outcomes. By contrast, the third cue should remain blocked from acquiring associative value due to the absence of a reward outcome for the partner. We indeed found, when tested in extinction, that the unblocked cue had acquired more associative value, as indexed by conditioned responding at the food trough, in comparison to the blocked cue. Importantly, this effect was still present when controlling for potential effect of secondary reinforcement associated with increased pellet deliveries. Crucially, this difference was absent (1) when social information exchange was impeded, (2) when the partner rat was absent during mutual reward delivery, and (3) when the unblocking cue was associated solely with partner reward but not actor reward, presenting a disadvantageous unequal reward distribution to the actor rat.</p><p>We thus conclude that mutual, equal reward delivery can trigger a positive vicarious reward experience that supports unblocking of associative learning about novel cues. This opens up possibilities to investigate behavioral aspects of the social-value driven reinforcement learning and its associated neural basis, processes that might be disturbed in psychiatric disorders marked by impaired reinforcement learning and/or social behavior such as autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kohls et al., 2012</xref>) and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fulford et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>All groups of actor and partner rats were initially trained separately on a Pavlovian discrimination problem. Subsequently, the rats went through a social learning phase were actor rats could learn to associate additional compounded cues with different reward outcomes delivered to the partner rat (social unblocking). Finally, we tested the associative strength of all cues, each presented in isolation, in a probe phase without a reward. In the inserted wall control experiment, we impeded the exchange of visual information by implementing an opaque wall and in the no partner present control experiment, we implemented the social learning phase without a partner rat present. Finally, in the unequal outcomes control experiment, we implemented the social learning phase with unequal, disadvantageous reward outcomes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> for the experiment timeline and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> for the group overview). We illustrate the actor rats’ conditioned responses with the time spent in the food cup, the food cup rate, and their latency to entry as dependent variables. We subdivide the result section into two parts. We demonstrate that cues that predicts no additional reward for the partner are blocked in both the experimental group and all control groups. We then show that, generally, we find vicarious unblocking for food cup occupancy in experimental group 1 (combined social-appetitive and social-only subgroups) but not in control group 1 (combined inserted wall and no partner present subgroups) and control group 2 (unequal outcomes). We furthermore examine the pattern of unblocking over time and in addition, we investigate potential identity unblocking by looking at the food cup rate. The second part of the results section presents several control experiments that show that the vicarious unblocking response is still present when controlling for secondary reinforcement of pellet dispenser sounds but not when a wall was placed between partners to prevent social information exchange (control group 1, inserted wall subgroup). Likewise, unblocking was diminished when there was no partner present during the social learning phase (control group 1, no partner present subgroup).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Behavioral apparatus, experimental timeline, and trial timeline.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The PhenoTyper consisting of lower and upper compartment in which behavioral training took place is displayed in the middle.

Actor rats (N = 20) were trained on a visual or auditory discrimination task with counterbalanced exemplars as aCS+ and aCS- stimuli (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). All actor rats developed a conditioned response to their own aCS+ (see example trial in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), resulting in an increase with learning in time spent in the food trough on aCS+ trials in anticipation of reward, independent of cue modality (see below). Concurrently, they learned to expect no reward during aCS- presentations, as witnessed by a steady decrease in time spent in the food trough on aCS- trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,c,e</xref>). A paired sample <italic>t</italic>-test examining the mean responding over the last 4 days of conditioning was performed. We found a significant difference in time spent in the food trough between the aCS+ and aCS- of the experimental group (M = 58.76, SD = 12.86; M = 21.19, SD = 13,21; <italic>t</italic>(19) = 12.116, p&lt;0.001), control group 1 (M = 54.649, SD = 14,604; M = 15.61, SD = 7.86; <italic>t</italic>(19) = 13.472, p&lt;0.001) and control group 2 (M = 53.82, SD = 18.06; M = 17.66, SD = 9.02; <italic>t</italic>(19) = 7.57, p&lt;0.001). We performed a two-way ANOVA to assess whether discrimination ability was similar in the experimental conditions and for the different stimulus types (auditory or visual) using the difference scores (aCS+/aCS-) on the last 4 days of training. There was no significant difference between groups (F<sub>(2, 46)</sub>=0.141, p=0.869), no difference between auditory and visual discrimination learning (F<sub>(1, 46)</sub>=0.076, p=0.785) and finally no interaction between experiment and stimulus type (F<sub>(2, 46)</sub>=0.297, p=0.745).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Conditioning per experimental phase.</title><p>Experimental group (combined social-appetitive and social-only subgroups).

The aCS+/aCS- of the actor and pCS+/pCS- of the partner were combined in three compound combinations with the following reward outcomes: both reward (BR: aCS+/pCS+), own reward (OR: aCS+/pCS-), and no reward (NR: aCS-/pCS-). In the main experiments, we chose to omit the ‘partner reward’ condition where the target rats would <italic>not</italic> receive reward, while the partner rats would (PR: aCS-/pCS+; but see unequal outcomes control), to avoid a potential reward/value conflict due to disadvantageous inequity aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fehr and Schmidt, 1999</xref>), which has been reported in rats as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oberliessen et al., 2016</xref>). Rats’ conditioned responses to these compound cues are shown (for an example trial see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Videos 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>) and a direct comparison of these responses to the original aCS+ and aCS- cues was made, both indexed by time spent in the food cup and the food cup rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,d,f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) In the subsequent analysis, only the behavior of the actor rats is reported. We applied a mixed repeated measures ANOVA design with the three compound trial types (BR [partner reward (PR) for control group 2], OR, and NR) and day 1-4 as within-subject factors, and with group (experimental vs control 1 vs control 2) as between-subject factor. The time spent in the food cup during the first 10 s after the cue onset was chosen as the dependent variable. We found a significant main effect of trial type (F<sub>(1.568, 76.845)</sub>=161.520, p&lt;0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.767) and importantly found an interaction effect of experiment * trial type (F<sub>(3.137, 76.845)</sub>=28.243, p&lt;0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.537), reflecting the difference in experiments that employed BR versus PR trials; and no effect of day (F<sub>(2.223, 108.195)</sub>=0.017, p&lt;0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.997). Post-hoc comparison revealed that actors’ responding to the BR cue did not differ significantly from the OR cue in experimental group 1 (mean difference = 0.490, SE = 2.367, p=1.00) and control group 1 (mean difference = 1.603, SE = 2.646, p=1.00), while in control group two responding is smaller in PR (partner reward) than OR trials (mean difference = −38.784, SE = 2.646, p&lt;0.001). BR responding was furthermore significantly higher than NR in experimental group 1 (mean difference = 32.9840.784, SE = 2.848, p&lt;0.001) and control group 1 (mean difference = 32.684, SE = 3.185, p&lt;0.001), while in control group 2, PR responding was not significantly different from NR (mean difference = −1.833, SE = 3.185, p=1.00), arguing against social facilitation of conditioned responding as a social learning mechanism. Finally, OR responding was significantly higher than NR responding in all groups (experimental group 1: mean difference = 32.495, SE = 3.704, p&lt;0.001; control group 1: mean difference = 31.081, SE = 4.141, p&lt;0.001; control group 2: mean difference = 36.901, SE = 4.141, p&lt;0.001). We furthermore assessed if the average compound phase food cup responses over 4 days changed in comparison to the last 4 days of discrimination learning due to the addition of pCS+ and pCS- cues. Next, we assessed if there were any between-group and within-condition differences in the compound phase food cup responses to BR, OR, and NR cues. We first ran a mixed repeated measures ANOVA analysis, with three difference scores (aCS+/aCS-, BR/NR, and OR/NR) as within-subject factors and group (experimental vs control 1 vs control 2) and stimulus type (auditory/visual) as between-subject factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a,b and c</xref>). We found a significant main effect of trial type (F<sub>(1.435, 66.017)</sub>=35.071, p&lt;0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.433), we furthermore found an interaction effect of trial type * group (F<sub>(2.870, 66.017)</sub>=22.188, p&lt;0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.491), an interaction effect of trial type * stimulus type (F<sub>(1.435, 66.017)</sub>=4.286, p=0.029, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.085) but no effect of experiment * trial type * stimulus type (F<sub>(2.870, 66.017)</sub>=1.577, p=0.187, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.064). Post-hoc comparison for the trial type * stimulus type interaction found that rats, over all experiments, have a significantly smaller contrast score for visual than auditory cues in the OR/NR contrast (mean difference = −10.862, SE = 4.141, p&lt;0.001), near significantly smaller in the BR/NR (mean difference = −6.409, SE = 3,432, p=0.068) but not smaller for the aCS+/aCS- (mean difference = +1.191, SE = 4.331, p=0.785). There are furthermore no differences within-experiments between aCS+/aCS- contrast scores and BR/NR or OR/NR contrast scores in all experimental groups, arguing against a putative effect on associative learning of the compound cues due to more vigorous responding in the compound phase. The only expected differences observed here is that the PR/NR contrast in control experiment 2 is smaller than the OR/NR (mean difference = 38.784, SE = 2.532, p&lt;0.001) and aCS+/aCS- contrast (mean difference = 38.044, SE = 3.676, p&lt;0.001), because of the altered reward contingencies. Finally, most importantly, we do not find any differences between contrasts between different experimental groups with the only exception again for the PR/NR contrast which is lower for the control group 2 (PR) compared experimental group 1 (BR) and control group 1 (BR). We find that the observed effect of stimulus type is mostly captured by a slight shift in conditioned responding to the NR compound in comparison to the aCS- responses during discrimination learning. When running a mixed repeated measures ANOVA design, with the aCS- and NR as within-subject factors and group (experimental vs control 1 vs control 2) and stimulus type (auditory/visual), we find a triple interaction effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d,e and f</xref>; F(2,46) = 5.247, p=0.009, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.186). It becomes clear that the rats show significantly more food cup responses to the visual cues in comparisons to the auditory cues in the NR (mean difference = 18.966, SE = 3.061, p&lt;0.001) compared to the aCS- in experimental group 1 but not in control groups 1 and 2. Conditioned responses to visual cues are furthermore higher in NR over aCS- in experimental group 1 (mean difference = 25.247, SE = 4.412, p&lt;0.001) and near significantly higher in control group 1 (mean difference = 9.00, SE = 4.697, p=0.062) but not in control group 2.</p><media id="video2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-60755-video2.mp4"><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Conditioned response of the actor and partner rats during the presentation of the BR (aCS+, pCS+) on day 4 of social learning.</title><p>This video shows the conditioned response of both the actor (top compartment) and partner (bottom compartment) rats of the social-appetitive subgroup on trial 1 day 4.

Importantly, no differences were observed between rewarded conditions indicating that partner presence does not influence food cup responses by itself. The only difference we notice is that adding a visual cue to an auditory cue leads to increased food cup response in the NR condition experimental group 1 and control group 1 but not in control group two compared to the aCS-. This could indicate a deficit in inhibitory action control of a learned auditory CS- because of partner presence, or reflect some difference in stimulus efficacy or asymmetrical processing interacting with social partner presence that cannot be entirely interpreted.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Probing vicarious associative learning</title><p>In the probe trials, we aimed to show the effect of associative learning driven by self and vicarious reward.

From these distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1d</xref>) of mean latencies, we assessed whether these distributions differed from zero and whether they differed between experimental groups with Z-tests. We found that the latency difference scores differed from zero in the experiment group (Z = −2.79, p=0.003) but not control group 1 (Z = −0.90, p=0.18) and control group 2 (Z = 2.08, p=0.98).

Importantly, this difference is significantly larger in the experimental group than in both control groups, further supporting the interpretation that pCS+ cues acquire associative value in the experimental group, supporting social unblocking.</p><p>Taken together, these results show that the actor rats exhibited more food cup directed behavior for the pCS+ cue than both the aCS- and pCS- cue over 10 trials of extinction in the experimental condition only. This means that when actor rats have fully learned a stimulus-reward association producing reward for themselves, adding a cue that predicted an additional reward delivery to a partner rat unblocked associative <italic>social</italic> learning (pCS+&gt;pCS-) about this cue, putatively due to a vicarious reward experience. By contrast, rats did not spend more time in the food cup for the pCS- cue compared to the aCS-, suggesting that additional cues that did <italic>not</italic> predict vicarious reward remained blocked from acquiring associative value. Contrary to the findings for the experimental group, the rats in control groups 1 and 2 did not show such conditioned responding, indicative of acquired value for the unblocked pCS+ cue, over 10 trials of extinction. This suggests that acquiring associative <italic>social</italic> value in this unblocking experiment requires social information exchange (control group: inserted wall) and/or the presence of a partner (control group: no partner present). Interestingly, disadvantageous unequal reward distributions putatively modulated the vicarious reward experience, impeding the unblocking effect. Our results reflect that cues related to mere reward delivery have to be controlled for, as witnessed by the pCS+ over aCS- difference even in the control experiments, highlighting the need for an active blocking control cue (pCS-) as implemented here.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Strength of the social unblocking effect over trials</title><p>We conclude from the simple effects analyses on the interaction effects in the experimental group that the associative value of unblocked novel cues can be measured for approximately six trials in extinction and will use this analysis window going forward.

Performing this analysis for both 10 s and 30 s period, we found that rats exhibited more food cup directed behavior for the pCS+ cue than both the pCS- cue over six trials of extinction in the experimental group 1 and not control groups 1 and 2 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>To directly contrast the unblocking effect between the experimental and control conditions, we calculated difference scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) for the direct comparison of the aCS+/aCS-, pCS+/pCS-, pCS+/aCS-, and pCS-/aCS- trial types, and tested for difference in these contrasts between experimental groups.

Indeed, in a two-way repeated measures ANOVA, we found no significant main (within-subject) effect of trial number on this contrast (F<sub>(4.016, 8.032)</sub>=5.96, p=0.666) and no interaction effect (F<sub>(10,130)</sub> = 0.460, p=0.914).

Indeed, when we examined the difference scores of the pCS+/pCS- contrast with a two-way repeated measures ANOVA with group (experimental, control) and trial 1-6 as factors, we found a significant main (between-subject) effect of group (F<sub>(2, 49)</sub>=6.397, p=0.003, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.207; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). This analysis revealed that the percent difference in responding between pCS+ and pCS- cues was higher for the experimental group than the control group 1 (mean difference = 12.903, SE = 4.531, p=0.019) and control group 2 (mean difference = 14.520, SE = 4.531, p=0.007).

In the contrast analysis for the 30 s period, we also found a significant main (between-subject) effect of group for the pCS+/pCS- contrast (F<sub>(2, 49)</sub>=5.976, p=0.005, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.196; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>), revealing that the percent difference in responding between pCS+ and pCS- cues was significantly higher (one-sided) for the experimental group than control group 1 (mean difference = 8.278, SE = 3.478, p=0.064) and significantly higher than control group 2 (mean difference = 11.493, SE = 3.478, p=0.005).

Results from the full contrast analyses for the pCS+/aCS- and pCS-/aCS- can be found in Table S1. We conclude from these results that the pCS+, predicting partner reward in a BR compound, became unblocked and acquired associative value in the experimental group but not in control groups 1 and 2, as witnessed by a significantly larger unblocked versus blocked contrast in the experimental versus control groups for both the first 10 s after cue onset and the whole 30 s period. We attribute this differential social unblocking effect to a putative difference in experienced vicarious reward. The control conditions, impeding social information exchange (control group; inserted wall) and/or the absence of the partner rat (control group; no partner present) presumably attenuated vicarious reward experience. In addition, disadvantageous unequal reward distributions did not lead to unblocking, suggesting that such distributions do not reflect vicarious reward experiences for our rats, in line with previous behavioral evidence of inequity aversion.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Different scores of the actor rats during extinction for 10 s and 30 s data for experimental group (combined social-appetitive and social-only subgroups: E, black squares), control group 1 (combined inserted wall and no partner present subgroups: C1, gray circles) and control group 2 (unequal outcomes: C2, gray triangles).</title><p>(<bold>a, e</bold>) Different scores of the percentage of time spent in food cup in the 10 s period (<bold>a</bold>) and 30 s (<bold>e</bold>) after cue onset over six trials for the [aCS+]-[aCS-] difference scores.

Food cup rate in the probe trials, next to food cup occupancy, could therefore potentially reflect model-based reward identity unblocking and therefore could provide insight in the influence of sensory features of social unblocking. Alternatively, if the additional partner reward is interpreted solely as a change in value but not identity, we would hypothesize that food cup rate would not be affected.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Vicarious reward unblocks food cup rate in experimental but not in control groups 1 and 2</title><p>To further explore the food cup rate as a measure of the potential identity unblocking effect in the experimental versus control condition, we applied the same a mixed repeated measures ANOVA design with trial type (aCS+, pCS+ [unblocked], pCS- [blocked], aCS-) and bin 1–3 as within-subject factors and group (experimental [N = 20] vs control 1 [N = 16] vs control 2 [N = 16]) as between-subject factor with food cup rate per minute for the first 10 s after the cue onset as dependent variable. We found a significant main effect of trial type (F<sub>(1.761, 86.275)</sub>=78.460, p&lt;0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.616) and an effect of bin (F<sub>(1.953, 5.713)</sub>=21.9968, p&lt;0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.310). We also find an interaction effect of experiment * trial type (F<sub>(3.52, 86.275)</sub>=5.033, p=0.002, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.170). Post-hoc comparison revealed here as well that the food cup rate was significantly higher for pCS+ cue in comparison to the pCS- cue in the experimental group (mean difference = 3.883, SE = 1.207, p=0.014; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>) but not in control group 1 (mean difference = 1.500, SE = 1.350, p=1.00; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>) and not in control group 2 (mean difference = −0.062, SE = 1.350, p=1.00; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i</xref>). Interestingly, we furthermore find that the food cup rate for the pCS+ cue is significantly higher than the aCS- in both the experimental group (mean difference = 5.683, SE = 1.074, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>) and control group 1 (mean difference = 5.125, SE = 1.200, p=0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>) but not in control group 2 (mean difference = 0.438, SE = 1.200, p=1.00; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i</xref>). These results could potentially indicate that the actor rats had a clear idea that the identity of the US food rewards in BR trials had changed, even though in the inserted wall control group where information exchange is impeded and/or in the no partner present control group where the partner is absent. We can conclude that identity unblocking as measured by the number of entries into the food cup is also present in this task and that the sensory aspects of the additional partner presence are necessary to associate the novel cue with positive social associative value (BR &gt;OR).</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Probing associative learning in the partner rat</title><p>During the compound phase in the experimental group and the control group inserted wall, the partner rat learns to associate another set of outcomes to the compound cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b,e</xref>): Both reward (BR: pCS+, aCS+), actor reward (OR: pCS-, aCS+) and no reward (NR: pCS-, aCS-) after going through discrimination learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,d</xref>). For the partner, learning about the aCS+ cue is thus confounded by being paired with two qualitatively different outcomes: from the perspective of the partner, it represented both a mutual reward outcome and an unequal disadvantageous reward outcome. It is thus likely that the aCS+ cue value would be increased due to the BR associated value but at the same time decreased due to the disadvantageous unequal outcome on OR trials. We tested whether the aCS+, associated with these multiple types of partner-own-reward outcomes, still showed evidence of unblocking by performing a two-factor repeated measures ANOVA with stimulus type and trial 1-6 as factors and the time spent in the food trough as the dependent variable. For the experimental group 1, we found a significant main effect of probe trial condition on time spent in food trough (F<sub>(1.551, 29.472)</sub>=79.840, p&lt;0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.808). As expected, time spent in food trough was higher for pCS+ than pCS- trials (mean difference = 39.00, SE = 3.774, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>), reflecting the partner’s initial discrimination learning. However, critically, pairwise comparisons revealed that the partners time spent in food trough was <italic>not</italic> higher for aCS+ cues compared to aCS- cues across six trials (mean difference = 3.530, SE = 1.691, p=0.303; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Furthermore, to see whether the absence of social information exchange (inserted wall control group) would influence partner learning we also performed a two-factor repeated measures ANOVA on the data of inserted wall control group. We found a significant main effect of probe trial condition on time spent in food trough (F<sub>(3, 21)</sub>=23.490, p&lt;0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.770). As expected, time spent in food trough was again higher for pCS+ than pCS- trials (mean difference = 43.525, SE = 6.56, p=0.002; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>) here though there was a trend toward higher responding for aCS+ cues than for aCS- cues (mean difference = 9.958, SE = 2.855, p=0.061; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). We conclude from these results that the compounded cue aCS+ has not become unblocked for the partner rat in the experimental group, however for the control group 1 we observe a clear trend indicative of unblocking. This potential unblocking could be influenced by two factors. First, secondary reinforcement of actor reward delivery (in aCS+ containing compounds) without observation of the actual reward delivery to the actor could have inhibited the attenuating effect of disadvantageous inequity aversion on unblocking and lead to this trend toward unblocking. Next, attentional-based unblocking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haselgrove et al., 2013</xref>) could play a role for the partner rat when it learns that one added cue predicts both reward and the omission of reward. This attentional unblocking effect would also be stronger if evidence of actor presence/reward would be blocked. A direct test of unblocking where both rats experienced disadvantageous unequal rewards was implemented as unequal outcomes. We did not include a version of the unequal outcomes control experiment where we also impeded social information transfer but would speculate that, in that case, unblocking would remain supressed as well.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Food cup responses of the partner rat during learning.</title><p>Experimental group 1 (combined social-appetitive and social-only subgroups): (<bold>a</bold>) Percentage of time spent in the food cup during discrimination learning.

Besides the vicarious experience of reward, other confounding factors could have contributed to learning/unblocking in our paradigm. Most notably, sources of secondary reinforcement should be excluded as potential drivers of learning. During discrimination learning, the actor rat is conditioned to receive pellets contingent on its aCS+. Afterward, in the compound phase, the rat is presented with an auditory–visual compound. Instead of one pellet drop (self-reward), now, on some trials, two pellets drop simultaneously (both reward trials). It is possible that the additional pellet delivery sound acted as a third CS+ in the compound, in addition to the aCS+ and pCS+. Because the sound of the pellet dispenser is already associated with the aCS+ of the actor rat, it is possible that the appetitive value increased with the intensity of this cue (two pellets dropping instead of one), thus enhancing the total value of cue configuration, leading to unblocking of the pCS+. To control for this possible source of secondary reinforcement, in a subgroup of rats (experimental group; social-only), we added a pellet dispenser aimed outside the box (placed at the same location as in the compound phase) already during the discrimination phase, providing the same acoustic features of pellet delivery to the target rat, without presenting additional reward (pellets were collected outside of the box). Next, our control group 1 consisted of a subgroup 1A where a wall impeded social contact and a subgroup 1B where there was no partner present. It is clear that these two groups are similar in that the actor rat does not observe food delivery to the partner. However, in the impeded wall condition, US conditioning could still occur due to pellet dispenser sounds (not controlled for; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) and partner rat related sounds while in the no partner present condition conditioning might still be caused by the observation of food delivery in the other compartment but not pellet dispenser related sounds (controlled for; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We therefore compare results between these conditions by again looking at responding during the first 10 s of the probe phase, which would equate to time period in which one extra pellet would be delivered. We performed a mixed repeated measures ANOVA design with trial type (pCS+, pCS-) and trial 1-6 as within-subject factors and four group (experimental group; social-appetitive: N = 8; one pellet added vs experimental group; social-only: N = 12; no new pellets added vs inserted wall control: N = 8; one pellet added, vs no partner present control: N = 8; one pellet added) as a between-subjects factor (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We found a significant main effect (F<sub>(1, 32)</sub>=17.964, p&lt;0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.360) of trial type, an interaction of group * trial type (F<sub>(3, 32)</sub> = 4.559, p=0.009, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.299; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>) and an effect of trial number (F<sub>(5, 160)</sub> = 7.286, p&lt;0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.186). Post hoc comparison reveals that responding to the pCS+ cue in extinction differs significantly from the pCS- cue in the social-appetitive group (one pellet added; mean difference = 24.808, SE = 4.578, p&lt;0.001), social-only group (no new pellets added; mean difference = 9.717, SE = 4.047, p=0.022) but not the inserted wall group (mean difference = −0.175, SE = 4.956, p=0.972) or the no partner present group (mean difference = 5.525, SE = 4.578, p=0.273). We then also compared responding during the full 30 s, which would equate to the addition of three extra pellets. We performed a similar mixed repeated measures ANOVA design with trial type (pCS+, pCS-) and trial 1-6 as within-subject factors and four group (experimental group; social-appetitive: N = 8; one pellet added vs experimental group; social-only: N = 12; no new pellets added vs inserted wall control: N = 8; one pellet added vs no partner present control N = 8; one pellet added) factors as between-subject factor. We also found a significant main effect (F<sub>(1, 32)</sub>=16.682, p&lt;0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.343), an interaction effect of group * trial type (F<sub>(3, 32)</sub> = 4.211, p=0.013, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.283; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>) and an effect of trial (F<sub>(3.406, 108.98)</sub> = 6.084, p&lt;0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.160). Post hoc comparison reveals that the pCS+ cue differs significantly from the pCS- cue in social-appetitive group (one pellet added; mean difference = 16.844, SE = 3.623, p&lt;0.001), in the social-only group (no new pellets added; mean difference = 6.622, SE = 2.58, p=0.032) but not the inserted wall control (mean difference = −1.239, SE = 3.623, p=0.971) and no partner present control (mean difference = 6.106, SE = 3.623, p=0.102). Finally, to zoom in on the temporal dynamics of pCS+ vs pCS- responding in these four experiments, we created time-resolved cumulative occupancy plots. We split the 10 s before and after cue onset in five bins of 2 s each and averaged responding during these bins over the six trials which we found have shown the effect. For an additional statistical analysis, we then looked at the cumulative responding over these five post-cue onset bins. We performed a mixed repeated measures ANOVA design with trial type (pCS+, pCS-) and time bins as within-subject factors and the four groups as between-subject factor. We find a significant main effect (F<sub>(1, 32)</sub> = 12.601, p=0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.283), an interaction effect of group * trial type (F<sub>(3, 32)</sub> = 3.780, p=0.020, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.262) and an effect of group * trial type * bin number (F<sub>(3.674, 39.674)</sub> = 6.084, p=0.025, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.233; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c,d,e,f</xref>). Post hoc comparison revealed that cumulative response during the pCS+ cue differs significantly from the pCS- cue in social-appetitive subgroup from bin 2 (mean difference = 0.493, SE = 0.185, p=0.012) and onward on bin 3 (mean difference = 1.091, SE = 0.278, p&lt;0.001), 4 (mean difference = 1.601, SE = 0.385, p&lt;0.001), and 5 (mean difference = 2.427, SE = 0.495, p&lt;0.001) after cue onset. In the social-only subgroup we find significant differences in bin 4 (mean difference = 0.804, SE = 0.314, p=0.015) and 5 (mean difference = 0.972, SE = 0.404, p=0.022).

However, it remained unclear whether vicarious reward value, which we define here as value derived from social signals associated with reward delivery to another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ruff and Fehr, 2014</xref>), could drive learning just as self-experienced value. If this was the case, then vicariously experienced reward should be able to reinforce behavior in a formal Pavlovian learning paradigm. Here we addressed this question by introducing a novel social unblocking task. We find that vicarious reward experience, operationalized in this task as rewards delivered to social partners (cagemates), can indeed drive learning about novel stimuli. After having fully learned that a specific CS+ cue predicted a self-reward, learning about a second cue delivered in compound with this CS+ was blocked, as predicted by learning theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fanselow and Wassum, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rescorla, 1972</xref>), when no additional self or other reward was contingent on this cue. Blocking was found when comparing the food cup response in extinction between trial types, here specifically for the pCS- (CS- cue predicting no partner reward) compared to the aCS- (CS- cue predicting no actor reward). Learning was unblocked, however, by providing an additional reward delivered to the partner simultaneously with the fully predicted self-reward as witnessed by a higher food cup response of actor on the pCS+ (CS+ cue predicting partner reward) compared directly to the pCS-. The social nature of the positive vicarious reward experience was specifically assessed in three control experiments: (1) Preventing the exchange of social information in the compound learning phase impeded the social unblocking effect (pCS+ ≈ pCS-). (2) Partner rat absence during mutual reward showed unblocking for the novel stimuli (pCS+&gt;aCS-) but crucially, not the social unblocking effect (pCS+ ≈ pCS-). (3) When the partner was rewarded and the actor not (aCS-, pCS+) and when the actor was rewarded but not the partner (aCS+, pCS-) we found no evidence either unblocking (pCS+ ≈ aCS-) or social unblocking (pCS+ ≈ pCS-). These results suggest that vicarious reward experience can indeed drive learning processes, in line with formal behavioral learning theory and that specific social aspects of the environment such as partner presence and partner visibility are necessary for observing a social unblocking effect (pCS+&gt;pCS-).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Learning theory</title><p>Our results extend previous work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holland, 1984</xref> and Geoffrey Schoenbaum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lopatina et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McDannald et al., 2011</xref>) on unblocking in appetitive Pavlovian conditioning. These authors found that rats, after learning that distinct cues have specific food outcomes, can show unblocking of learning for cues added in compound, when self-rewards were altered by increasing reward value (e.g. an upward shift from one to three pellets) or a change in reward identity (same reward type but a shift in reward features such as flavor). By contrast, learning was blocked when no such reward change occurred (e.g. same reward amount or same identity). According to reinforcement learning theory, the upshift or change in identity led to a discrepancy between the expected reward (one pellet) and the received reward (three pellets), thus producing a reward prediction error. The theory states that if the added cue reliably predicts the increase in reward/identity outcome, it will acquire the value inherent in the reward itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sutton and Barto, 1981</xref>). The main indicator of learning about the value of a (novel) cue in the unblocking paradigm is an increase in the time spent in the food cup in the probe (extinction) phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lopatina et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McDannald et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, we observed a higher time spent in the food cup for the cue predicting mutual rewards to the actor rat and its conspecific than to the cue that predicts own-rewards. Taking into account the results of the control experiments, we conclude that the observed enhanced food cup response, that is, the social unblocking effect could be driven by an upshift-related vicarious reward prediction error. The observed social unblocking effect adds to the emerging literature showing that animals attach value to rewards delivered to conspecifics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hernandez-Lallement et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kashtelyan et al., 2014</xref>) and learn about cues that predict rewards delivered to others. The social reinforcement learning hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hernandez-Lallement et al., 2016</xref>) proposes that integration of social signals expressed by partners can aid in making appropriate decisions in a social context. Evidence for this hypothesis comes from the prosocial choice task (PCT) in which it was found that, rewards delivered to oneself and to a partner are preferred over a reward delivery only to the actor himself in both monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Horner et al., 2011</xref>) and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hernandez-Lallement et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Márquez et al., 2015</xref>). In rats, it was found that this effect was modulated by the behavior displayed by the other rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Márquez et al., 2015</xref>) and that this effect was impaired when the partner was replaced by a toy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hernandez-Lallement et al., 2015</xref>) or when the display of the partner’s preference was impeded. In monkeys it was furthermore found that cues that are associated with reward delivery to another monkey were preferred over cues that were associated with juice delivery to a chair with no monkey in it and this preference was absent, in the non-social condition, when there was only a juice bottle present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2011</xref>). We found that social learning occurs when additional reward was delivered to a visible partner but not when preventing the exchange of social information by an opaque wall or when the partner was absent during social learning, providing further evidence that social signals are indeed necessary for learning in social, other regarding, paradigms. A recent study furthermore, shows that macaques increase licking frequency in line with a higher probability of self-reward but decrease their anticipatory licking with increased probability of reward delivery to another monkey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Noritake et al., 2018</xref>). The authors interpret this decrease of anticipatory licking as an indicator of the negative affect associated with unequal disadvantageous reward pay-outs. Both monkeys and rats have been found to have a distaste for these unequal pay-outs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brosnan and De Waal, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oberliessen et al., 2016</xref>). Here we provide similar evidence that in rats tested in our social unblocking paradigm, disadvantageous unequal reward outcomes do not support unblocking of cues that predict reward to the other rat but not oneself. Our finding extend the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rescorla, 1999</xref> who found that changing the outcome of an aCS- cue by adding a cue in compound that predicts self-reward leads to unblocking of that added cue. This contrasts with the lack of unblocking found here, indicating that the observation of reward delivery to the social partner does not have similar reinforcement properties as adding self-reward, possibly due to the negative affect associated with disadvantageous unequal reward outcomes.</p><p>Further research is necessary to see whether cues associated with vicarious reward or social reinforcement can also act as a conditioned reinforcer for instrumental responses of rats, as has been found humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lehner et al., 2017</xref>), in a similar way as has been found for appetitive cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kruse et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rescorla, 1994</xref>). Finally, it is important to investigate if cues predicting vicarious rewards can guide rats’ choices in a social setting. It has been found that rats choose a reward arm in a T-maze that leads to play behavior more than an arm leading to a social encounter where play was absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Humphreys and Einon, 1981</xref>). Furthermore, social play can induce a social place preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calcagnetti and Schechter, 1992</xref>) and rats are willing to lever press for social play reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achterberg et al., 2016</xref>). Our task indicates that the unblocked cue has attained the rewarding properties of social reward and it is therefore likely that a presented unblocked cue would be preferred over a blocked cue when tested in a two-alternative forced choice task. We finally expect that our social unblocking effect depends on the successful transmission of social signals between the actor and partner rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nicol, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hernandez-Lallement et al., 2016</xref>) and that different signal modalities (auditory, visual, olfactory) might contribute and combine in additive or interactive fashion.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Overall, these data provide evidence that vicarious reward experience can drive associative learning in rats and that the transmission of social cues between rats is necessary for this learning. Further experiments should be conducted to reveal which mode(s) of social information processing are necessary and sufficient to drive unblocking through social value. Overall, our novel behavioral paradigm could be used to further explore how rats learn about value in social contexts and is well suited to probe the neural circuits involved in social reinforcement learning.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>About 88 male Long Evans rats where housed in pairs of two and kept under an inverted 12:12 hr light-dark cycle, in a temperature (20 ± 2°C), and humidity-controlled (approx. 60%) colony room.

Operant devices were positioned on the right side of the box at the level of the separation wall: an LED Stimulus Light (Med Associates, ENV-211m) with green cover was positioned 10 cm above the ground and a house light (Med Associates, ENV-215m) 28 cm above the ground. A speaker (Med Associates, ENV-224am) was positioned at 20 cm above the ground for the playback of auditory stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right panel). Auditory stimuli were played back at a loudness of 75 dB measured with a hand-held analyser (type 2250s from Brüel and Kjaer) right in front of the speaker. In the top cover of the Skinner boxes, a camera (Basler, acA1300-60gc, GigE) was positioned to obtain videos of the behavioral experiment at 25 fps. Analyses of the recorded videos was performed with EthoVision XT 11.5 (Noldus Information Technology). Finally, a USV-microphone was positioned next to the camera for recording ultrasonic vocalizations using Ultra Vox XT (Noldus Information Technology).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Behavioral training</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Pavlovian discrimination task</title><p>Before the start of behavioral training, rats were put on food restriction to reduce their weight to 90% of their free-feeding weight. Within a pair of cage mates, one rat was assigned at random as the actor animal, and the other as the partner animals. As a first step, they were habituated to their pre-determined training side of the customised PhenoTyper for 3 days (15 min per day). During this period, they could retrieve six pellets that were put along the edges of their respective side of the box. Subsequently, the discrimination learning phase started. Here the pairs of rat cage mates were divided into two groups; one group of rat pairs would learn a visual discrimination problem, and the other an auditory discrimination problem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, left panel). The visual stimuli to be discriminated consisted of a houselights flashing at 1 Hz (0.1 s on, 0.9 s off) and a steady green light; the auditory stimuli were made up by a 4.0 kHz clicker (0.1 s on, 0.9 s off) and a 1.5 kHz (75 dB) steady tone (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> for overview of stimulus contingencies). The different groups (auditory vs visual) were each trained alone either in the upper or lower compartment of the Skinner box, and the side assignments between actor and partner rats were counterbalanced between experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Each rat received 14 days of discrimination training. One daily session consisted of 40 trials, of which 20 trials were aCS+ and 20 aCS-. The order of aCS+ and aCS- trials was pseudo-randomized, with no more than three trials of one kind occurring in a row. Stimuli were presented for 30 s and at every 10 s (+ 0.1 to 0.4 s jitter), a pellet was delivered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We trained a total of N = 20 actor rat and 20 partner rats on the discrimination problem in the experimental group, 16 actors and 16 partners in the control group 1 and 16 animals (all considered actors) in control group 2 (unequal outcomes). The experimental group was divided in subgroup 1A (social-appetitive subgroup) and 1B (social-only subgroup) and in subgroup 1A (inserted wall) and 1B (no partner present; See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> for overview). The social-only subgroup consisted of 12 actors and 12 partners of the N = 40 experimental group. Here a second pellet dispenser was already placed outside of the behavioral box during the entire discrimination learning phase, at the opposite side of where the current rat was trained, delivering pellets outside of the box. This additional dispenser placement ensured that the sound of additional pellet drops was similar to the compound conditioning phase (see below). Providing a uniform pellet delivery sound associated with self-reward pellet delivery throughout the experiment prevented any difference in pellet delivery related sounds as a source of secondary reinforcement from influencing the conditioning to added cues in the compound phase. In the additional social-appetitive subgroup, the second pellet dispenser was not active during the discrimination phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This gave us the opportunity to make direct comparison within the experimental group to investigate potential effects of secondary reinforcement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The ITI in both experimental and control group was made up of a fixed 30 s window supplemented with a randomized time window ranging from 5 to 100 s with steps of 5 ms, uniformly distributed. The ITIs were thus fully randomized, resulting in a total variable ITI with a mean of 80 ms. Ultrasonic vocalizations where recorded from 10 s before cue onset to 20 s after cue offset, for a total duration of 60 s per trial. After completion of the discrimination phase, rats progressed to the compound conditioning stage.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Compound conditioning</title><p>After discrimination training was completed, rats in the visual discrimination group received 1 day of pre-exposure to the two novel auditory stimuli while the rats in the auditory discrimination group received 1 day of pre-exposure to the two novel visual stimuli. The pre-exposure session consisted of one session with six trials. The stimuli were presented in a randomized order with ITIs of 15, 30 45, 60, 75, and 90 s. Pre-exposure was done to minimize an influence of novelty induced enhancement on the conditioning of added compound stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Holland and Gallagher, 1993</xref>) and enhance the discriminability of these added stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Honey and Hall, 1989</xref>) for each group. This would strengthen the evidence that any observed blocking or unblocking would be related to task conditions, rather than novelty. In the compound phase, three different conditions were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, middle panel). In both reward (BR) trials, both the (respective visual or auditory) CS+ of the actor group (aCS+) and the partner group (pCS+) were simultaneously displayed and both rats were rewarded with three pellets. In the own reward (OR) trials, the respective aCS+ was simultaneously displayed with the aCS- of the partner group and only the actor group was rewarded. In the NR trials, the respective aCS- was simultaneously displayed with the aCS- of the partner group and neither actor nor partner were rewarded. A compound conditioning session consisted of 20 trials per condition. The conditions BR, OR, and NR were pseudo-randomized with every condition not being repeated more than three times in a row. ITI randomization, stimulus presentation, and reward delivery were implemented as in the discrimination phase.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Probe trials</title><p>During probe trials, all rats were tested in isolation for one extinction session in their assigned box compartment. All stimuli were now presented in isolation, both the aCS+ and aCS- learned in the Pavlovian discrimination task as well as the two novel stimuli pCS+ (both reward CS+) and pCS- (own reward CS-) added in the compound phase, for which learning was hypothesized to become unblocked and blocked, respectively. Rats in both groups went through 10 trials for each of these four stimuli, presented in isolation and without reward delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, right panel). The four stimuli were pseudo-randomized with every condition not being repeated more than three times in a row.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-4"><title>Control experiments</title><p>In the inserted wall control experiment, eight actor rats and eight partner rats went through the same three experimental conditions. The only difference here is that during the compound phase, the wall that separated the Skinner box compartments was rendered opaque by adding an additional black wall, to block contact between the actor and partner rats. We hypothesized that if visual, and/or auditory and/or olfactory contact between the rats facilitated the social information transmission that helps to unblock reinforcement learning of compound cues, then obstructing these transmission cues should impair unblocking. In the inserted wall control group, we chose to also implement the 1-pellet dispenser condition (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), to match our results to the condition where secondary reinforcement might still play a role. If differences between the inserted wall control and the social-appetitive experimental conditions would still emerge, this would strengthen the interpretation that social unblocking was driven primarily by vicarious reward, and not by secondary reinforcement learning, as the putative reinforcing effect of an additional pellet drop during the compound phase was present in both the social-appetitive experimental and inserted wall control conditions.</p><p>In the no partner present control experiment, eight actors went through the same experimental conditions. Here, the only difference was that during the compound phase the partner rat was not present. Instead, pellet dispensers dropped pellets in a custom-made 3D printed plastic food cup including the metal parts which were used in the original food cup for catching the pellet. This made sure that the sound of pellet delivery was similar as in the experimental group. Pellets furthermore fell through the custom-made food cup in a small cup underneath as to avoid the pellets to stack up in view of the actor rat. Finally, it is important to note that secondary reinforcement of the additional pellet dispenser activity itself was controlled for by delivering pellets outside of the box during discrimination learning, as in the social-only experimental subgroup (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This would ensure that only the pellet delivery related sound of falling in the food cup (of the empty partner side) and not sounds made by the pellet dispenser itself would influence associative learning. This control condition was used to assess if visual and auditory observation of pellet delivery in the food cup could unblock learning by itself. Finally, in control experiment 2: unequal outcomes, actor and partner rats went through the same stages of conditioning only now during compound conditioning the BR condition became a partner reward condition while the OR remained the same. With this symmetric implementation, actor rats’ OR is partner rats’ PR and vice versa and both groups of rats can be treated as actors, doubling the sampling size for one experiment. This control experiment was used to assess if disadvantageous unequal reward outcomes to partner rats would unblock learning.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-5"><title>Statistical data analyses</title><p>Entries into the food trough were recorded as photobeam breaks. Raw data were processed in EthoVision XT 11.5 (Noldus Information Technology) to extract our dependent variables: time spent in the food trough and number of entries in the trough (food cup rate). Food cup directed behavior in the form of time spent in the food trough and latency to entry were analyzed per trial and per condition for all stages of learning; further analysis and graph preparation was performed using custom-made scripts in MATLAB (version 2014b, MathWorks). All statistics was performed using SPSS (IBM Corp. Released 2017. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 25.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp). To assess the strength of learning during discrimination and compound conditioning, only the first 10 s of the cue period was analyzed to avoid the influence of reward delivery/omission feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McDannald et al., 2011</xref>) and the time spent in the food cup was used as measure for conditioned responding. In the probe trials however reward was absent, therefore here we analyzed both 10 s and 30 s period. Previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burke et al., 2008</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McDannald et al., 2011</xref> used the percentage of time spent at the food trough and the food cup rate to assess value unblocking and identity unblocking, respectively as measures for conditioned responding. As social unblocking is thought to mainly reflect value unblocking, we report the percentage of time spent as our main outcome parameter. For completion, we also report food cup rate to assess identity unblocking. Discrimination learning performance was quantified by averaging responding to the cues over the last 4 days of training and comparing the mean between aCS+ and aCS- and difference scores of CS+ - CS- for contrasting cue modalities using paired sample t-tests. Performance in the compound phase was quantified using a two factor repeated measures ANOVA on the mean response rate per day across conditions (BR, OR, and NR) and post hoc tests were performed to assess the significance of any differences between conditions, corrected for multiple comparisons. Performance in the probe trials was assessed by averaging responding of the actor rats time spent in the food cup and food cup rate over five bins (two trials per bin) and running a two factor repeated measures ANOVA over these bins and the four stimuli types (aCS+, pCS+ (unblocked), pCS- (blocked) and aCS-) separately for experimental and control experiments. Differences between conditions and bins were assessed with post-hoc tests, again corrected for multiple comparisons. A putative difference between latencies to entry was analyzed in a two-step process, as latencies were not normally distributed. Using a bootstrap procedure (N = 5000 iterations), per experimental condition we sampled N probe-trial latencies to entry (with N resampled with replacement, equal to the number of trials with valid entries excluding non-entries and latencies &lt; 0.040 s) for the unblocked cue and the blocked cue throughout all probe trials, and stored (per iteration) the difference in mean latency for these samples. This generated an N = 5000 bootstrap population of mean latency differences per experiment, with all of these distributions following a normal-like distribution (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using a Z-test, we assessed (1) whether each distribution was significantly different from 0 (suggesting a significant difference in latency to enter between trial types) and (2) whether this latency difference was significantly different between experimental conditions. For the direct comparison between Experiment and control group in the probe trials we performed a mixed repeated measures ANOVA with factors trials (trial 1 to 6) and stimuli (aCS+, pCS+ [unblocked], pCS- [blocked] and aCS-) and experiment group as a between-subjects factor (experiment, control). Differences between conditions between experiments were assessed with post-hoc tests, corrected for multiple comparisons. Finally, to further in depth look at the difference between experiment and control group difference scores were calculated for every available contrast (aCS+/aCS-, pCS+/pCS-, pCS+/aCS-, and pCS-/aCS) and for these contrasts a two factor repeated measures ANOVA was calculated. For all RM-ANOVA’s, Mauchly’s test of sphericity was performed and, when significant, the Greenhouse-Geisser correction was applied.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5"

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Vicarious reward unblocks associative learning about novel cues in male rats&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Patricia H Janak (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The study was judged to be a creative and unique attempt to demonstrate a fundamental learning property in a social situation. However the importance is based on demonstrating that it was the social or vicarious nature of the reward and it was judged to be missing significant controls to rule out a variety of other possibilities that are too numerous to complete in within the timeframe of a <italic>eLife</italic> revision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This study uses classic learning theory procedures – blocking and unblocking – to determine if learning the relationship between a pavlovian stimulus and reward can occur through observation. The authors suggest that cues that predict reward to a conspecific can 'unblock' learning and cause observer rats to respond to a stimulus as if they expect reward for themselves. It is an interesting and clever idea but I have several major problems with the study.</p><p>1) The authors do not show that they actually get blocking. Overall, I thought the results would have been more significant if the authors showed that vicarious reward could block new learning, but instead the authors focus on unblocking. The problem is that they don't actually demonstrate that they would get blocking in their paradigm. Thus, I'm not convinced that vicarious reward can unblock learning when there is no evidence of blocking to begin with. Also, with unblocking it seems like anything that changes attention and arousal might cause a stimulus to become associated with physical reward that the animals gets during those compound stimuli.</p><p>2) I think the authors are missing a critical control where reward is delivered to an empty box or fake rat as done in most primate studies. It could be that just having a pellet delivered to the food cup on the other side of the box would produce unblocking.</p><p>3) There is no analysis of video. It is not clear what the rats are paying attention to during the task. Do the rats pay attention to each other? During the control sessions do rats investigate the barrier to gain access to the other rat or are they completely unaware that there is a rat on the other side of the box? Do these measures vary across contexts and stimuli?</p><p>4) We are told very little about the behavior of the other rat. How well did they respond to cues during social and non-social tasks? Did obtaining food bring the partner rat closer to the central part of the cage so that the rats interacted more? If so, this could have served as a social reward. That is, during 'own' reward trials the partner rat would not be visible to the target rat thus this stimulus would be less rewarding than 'both' reward trials. During 'both' reward trials, the target rat received two rewards, one is the pellet and the other is to see and possibly interact with the other rat.</p><p>5) The fact that the pellet dispenser worked so well as a secondary reinforced made the results less compelling. Was the pellet dispenser outside the box (control) as audible to the observer rat as when it was inside the box? Also, is it possible the clanging of the pellet acted as a cue? These issues are another reason why the empty box control mentioned above seems critical.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The submission by van Gurp et al., introduced a behavioral model to show that exposing rats to a social partner during a pavlovian task can drive and maintain reinforcement learning. The authors used a classical blocking/unblocking procedure to train rats first to discriminate between two stimuli (either visual or auditory) that predicted either a food pellet delivery (CS+) or nothing (CS-). In a second phase of the experiment, the authors exposed the rats to a compound training during which both rats (actor and partner) were trained together in the same box divided in two compartments by a transparent barrier. During this phase, the actor rats were exposed to either (1) aCS+ and pCS+ (actor and partner related cues – under this schedule both rats received a pellet); (2) aCS+ and pCS- (only the actor rats received a pellet); or (3) aCS- and pCS- (no pellets for both rats). Finally, the authors presented each cue separately in an extinction probe test showing that once actor rats have fully learned a stimulus-reward association producing reward for themselves, adding a cue that predicted an additional reward delivery to a partner rat unblocked associative learning about that cue. Moreover, by adding an opaque barrier between the two sides of the chamber and preventing visual contact, the authors showed that the pCS+ did not unblock associative learning.</p><p>I enclose below my comments for the authors.</p><p>1) The behavioral work, while intriguing, is under-developed. It is not completely clear what is the role of the social partner in this task. The authors should report the behavioral data for this group for two major reasons. Firstly, in a pavlovian task like the one described in this manuscript, there is not a real distinction between actor and partner. Indeed, each actor is the partner of the other rat and vice-versa. Secondly, and probably more importantly, reporting the data of the social partners can be a useful way to show replication of the data (which is a critical feature of a new behavioral procedure). Moreover, the authors should report more data describe the rats' behavior during the task (i.e. is the actor rat watching the partner consuming the pellets? Do both rats enter the food cup at the same time? etc.).</p><p>2) In line with the above point, it seems that the unblocking effect is driven by the simple presence of a social partner. Indeed, the simple presentation of pCS+ without the visual contact of the social partner, did not unblock associative learning. However, it is hard to disentangle the role of pCS+ from the presence of the social partner only. Therefore, the authors should add a control group in which only the social partner is getting a pellet (aCS- and pCS+). The authors reported some rational to explain why they did not run this experiment; however, this group can show that even without receiving a pellet the pCS+ has a strong effect on the actor rats during the unblocking procedure. This will show a real social transmission effect from the social partner to the actor.</p><p>3) It is also critical to replicate the finding from the Control group. Given the lower n (8 vs 20 rats in the Experimental group), the variability in this group is bigger than the first experiment and also the magnitude of the effect (for both aCS+ and aCS-) is different relative to the experimental group. This is a major concern considering the reliability of the new model.</p><p>4) The direct comparisons between experimental and control conditions seems slightly strange. It is hard to direct compare two groups that have been exposed to different behaviors. One group experienced the presence of a social partner and the other did not. I suggest avoiding this statistical comparison, also because the author decided to arbitrarily select 6 trials for this comparison instead of the 10 total trials. Moreover, for the control group the authors reported no interaction between condition type and bin number (Subsection “Control group”), but still reported posthoc comparison. Please clarify.</p><p>5) The authors should present the data of the auditory vs visual cues in two different lines (and different colors) in the same graph before collapsing them in a single curve. It is important to see that the two modalities are similar.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>van Gurp and colleagues have conducted an innovative experiment on possible learning by observer rats of cue-reward associations when that reward is delivered to a nearby familiar cagemate. Using the blocking procedure, during compound cue presentation reward is given as before to the observer rat, and, at the same time, delivered to a cagemate directly beside the observer rat in a clever chamber that should allow for visual, olfactory, and auditory information sharing. The results show that the observer rat responds more for the newly added cue that was paired with cagemate reward than for a newly added cue paired with no cagemate reward, but paired with the expected reward (traditional blocking condition). A control group failed to show clear differences in responding between the observance unblocked cue and the traditionally blocked cue when observational across subjects was presumably greatly reduced by insertion of a divider between testing cage compartments.</p><p>These findings were well-predicted by the foregoing literature, and are an elegant test of the power of vicarious reward to impact learning. The findings provide evidence that vicarious reward acts similarly as directly experienced reward, adding to the body of work extending reward learning mechanisms to aspects of social interaction.</p><p>I found no major shortcomings of this work. It is the case that one measure, percent time in the food cup, provided the strongest evidence for the unblocking, while the others are less clearly supportive. I do not view this as a shortcoming since multiple measures of conditioned behavior could tap into distinct aspects of the associative process. I do wonder if it might be more convenient if the authors move the supplemental data to the main manuscript so it is easier to inspect the findings.</p><p>One might expect more content here, such as a neurobiological follow-up study. While this work sets the stage for that, the initial behavioral demonstration in my view warrants publication.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Vicarious reward unblocks associative learning about novel cues in male rats&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

This reviewer comments that we do not show the blocking effect in our paradigm and therefore stimuli cannot become unblocked in our task. We agree and value the importance of showing blocking and now include argumentation supporting that we do indeed observe blocking in our task. In both the experimental group, control group 1 and control group 2, the aCS+ was fully learned and coupled to novel cue predicting no reward to the partner rat (pCS-, in the “Own Reward” [OR] compound). Consequently, blocking should be observed in relation to the pCS- cue, because there are no changes in self- or partner-reward from the perspective of the actor rat. To show blocking in our task setup, we directly compare the novel pCS- cue to the fully learnt aCS- cue. We found no significant differences between the pCS- and aCS- across all groups, supporting our interpretation that learning about this cue was blocked (see Figure 3A,B and C).</p><p>We do acknowledge that, in early trials, there is an enhanced response to the pCS- relative to the aCS-. We think however that this could be caused by some learning driven by social facilitation during the compound phase: there, partner rats react more to their own pCS- learnt cue when it is presented in the pCS-/aCS+ compound (OR for actor, a PR trial from the perspective of the partner), than when it is presented in the aCS-/ pCS- compound (NR; See new figure S1B). If actor rats interpret the partner's approach to the food cup during OR trials as a signal that the partner rat is rewarded, this could putatively lead to some unblocking. However, in the new control experiment 2, where both rats are only rewarded alternatingly (OR and PR trials), complete blocking can be found (Figure 3C,F,I). This enhanced probe-phase response to the pCS- in the experimental condition the decreases rapidly though, while the pCS+ related unblocking response last until trial 6 (cf. Figure 4B vs 4D).</p><p>Reviewer 1 furthermore comments on the fact that we miss the empty box control as present in most primate studies. We agree that this control is critical and we have therefore implemented their comment as control experiment 1b. There, we show that the social unblocking effect of differential responding for pCS+ &gt; pCS- is absent and therefore conclude that the vicarious reward experience of mutual reward delivery to actor and partner is necessary to drive social learning in our task. We do observe more responding to the pCS+ over the aCS-, which we attribute to the influence of secondary reinforcement of food related cues that we have shown to influence the strength of the social unblocking effect (Experimental group 1b).</p><p>Reviewer 1 also commented on the influence of secondary reinforcement in our experiment. We indeed show that unblocking is smaller when explicitly controlling for pellet delivery sounds. This indicates that the sounds of pellet delivery can indeed augment the social unblocking effect, but our experiments show that this secondary reinforcement interpretation cannot solely explain our results. We would like to address this comment by going through the observed findings of the different control experiments. Firstly, when not controlling for secondary reinforcement but impeding social information exchange, we do not observe unblocking, indicating that the audible additional pellet delivery sounds alone cannot account for the observed unblocking. Furthermore, when we do control for pellet dispenser sounds in control experiment 1b (by running a second pellet dispenser already during discrimination learning) but do drop pellets in an empty chamber with no partner rat present, it also did not lead to social unblocking (pCS+ &gt; pCS-). Finally, we would like to add that observing a partner rat being fully rewarded in control group 2 (pCS+/aCS-, PR), including pellet delivery sounds and pellet consumption, still does not lead to unblocking. Summarised, these control experiments show that partner rat presence and mutual reward outcomes are necessary to drive our reported social unblocking effect.</p><p>Finally, Reviewer 1 also comments on the importance of social interaction between rats during cue presentation. We agree completely with this and are running active analyses on not only social interaction scoring, but also ultrasonic vocalisation detection and classification in the context of this social task. We hope that these extensive analyses should help elucidate how social learning and social transfer of reinforcement value takes place and aim to present them in a future manuscript as it is beyond the scope of the current paper that establishes the behavioral paradigm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The submission by van Gurp et al., introduced a behavioral model to show that exposing rats to a social partner during a pavlovian task can drive and maintain reinforcement learning.

Firstly, reviewer 2 argues that we should report the partner rat data as there is no real distinction between actor and partner rat. We are convinced that this is not the case in our task setup, as in the main experiment, actor and partner rats intentionally experience different reward contingencies. Our compound conditions in the main experiment include the BR, OR and NR but not the PR. The consequence of this decision makes our task asymmetrical between actors and partners. If a PR condition was included in the current task set, we would assume that the negative aspect of seeing another rat being rewarded, but not oneself (aCS-/pCS+ [PR], see Control Experiment 2), could interact with the unblocking effect observed for BR-associated vicarious value due to mutual reward delivery. Importantly, we do indeed observe that when rewards are disadvantageously unequal for the actor (Partner reward, aCS-, pCS+), unblocking is not observed, possibly due to inequity aversion (Control group 2). We agree to the importance of showing the partner rat data and have therefore included it in figure S2. Partner rats clearly show more responding to the aCS+/pCS- than aCS-/pCS- compound cues, suggesting that, for them, the aCS+ does carry some vicarious value, or drives social facilitation of food cup entries. It is not enough to support formal unblocking as seen for the actors though.</p><p>Reviewer 2 furthermore adds that our observed effect could be related to a mere partner presence effect. Here, we would like to again refer to control experiment 2 where we find that observation of another rat being rewarded, while not receiving self-reward does not lead unblocking. This provide evidence against a mere presence interpretation of our social unblocking effect.</p><p>Reviewer 2 then addresses the problems associated with replicability due to the small sample size in control experiment 1a (wall condition). We very much agree that is important that this control needs a bigger sample size. We unfortunately had to make a practical choice between enhancing the sample size of experiment 1a or adding the empty cage control. As we think that the empty cage control is crucial for comparison with other studies and broadens the range of control conditions, we decided to include this manipulation. We do want to emphasise that we observe in neither the opaque wall nor the empty-cage a social unblocking effect, and also not when combining both controls as in our main analysis (Control 1A+1B). We hope that this approach will instil confidence that our observed effect is indeed of a vicarious social nature.</p><p>Reviewer 2 finally asked for the dissociation between visual and auditory cue learning. We performed additional analyses that indeed show that there is an effect of cue type but that this is limited to the NR condition in the compound phase but not on cue responding in the discrimination learning phase (Figure 1—figure supplement 1).</p></body></sub-article></article>
