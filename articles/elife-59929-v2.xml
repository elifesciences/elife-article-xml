has been shown to be heritable and is often associated with differences in disease susceptibility between individuals. Many studies focused on mapping associations between genetic and gene regulatory variation, yet much less attention has been paid to the evolutionary processes that shape the observed differences in gene regulation between individuals in humans or any other primate. To begin addressing this gap, we performed a comparative analysis of gene expression variability and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in humans and chimpanzees, using gene expression data from primary heart samples. We found that expression variability in both species is often determined by non-genetic sources, such as cell-type heterogeneity. However, we also provide evidence that inter-individual variation in gene regulation can be genetically controlled, and that the degree of such variability is generally conserved in humans and chimpanzees. In particular, we found a significant overlap of orthologous genes associated with eQTLs in both species. We conclude that gene expression variability in humans and chimpanzees often evolves under similar evolutionary pressures.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Chimpanzee</kwd><kwd>gene expression variability</kwd><kwd>eQTL</kwd><kwd>stabilizing selection</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM131726</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gilad</surname><given-names>Yoav</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Similar evolutionary pressures on gene expression between human and chimpanzee populations contribute to the observation that inter-individual gene expression variability is similar across genes in these species.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Variation in gene expression underlies many phenotypic differences between and within species. Gene expression itself is a quantitative phenotype that is subject to both random drift and natural selection. A deeper understanding of how natural selection shapes gene expression across primates is central to our understanding of human evolution, and may also elucidate the mechanistic basis for variation in quantitative traits and disease risk within species.</p><p>Several studies have used a comparative transcriptomics approach across species and tissues to identify genes whose expression patterns are consistent with the action of natural selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barbosa-Morais et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brawand et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Merkin et al., 2012</xref>). For example, a pattern of highly similar gene expression levels in all primates may be consistent with the action of stabilizing selection on gene regulation, and potentially, negative selection on the corresponding regulatory elements. Indeed, many studies have found that the expression of most genes evolves slower than expected under neutrality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Khaitovich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Khan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lemos et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Merkin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Romero et al., 2012</xref>). Conversely, genes that show a reduced or elevated expression level exclusively in the human lineage may indicate directional selection on gene expression in humans, potentially resulting in positive selection for particular regulatory variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blekhman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gilad et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Perry et al., 2012</xref>). However, it is often difficult to determine whether lineage-specific expression changes are due to inter-species environmental differences or to natural selection on certain regulatory variants.</p><p>A complementary approach to understanding gene regulation and associated selection pressures utilizes within-species variation to identify genetic variants that affect gene expression levels. Such variants are referred to as expression quantitative trait loci, or eQTLs. Overall, there is some evidence that eQTLs are evolving under weak negative selection. For example, the magnitude of eQTL effect size on expression levels is weakly anti-correlated with eQTL allele frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Battle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Glassberg et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, the set of human genes associated with an eQTL (eGenes) tend to be slightly depleted for genes relevant to universally conserved and essential cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Popadin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Ward and Gilad, 2019</xref>), and for genes at the center of protein interaction networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Battle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mähler et al., 2017</xref>). These observations are consistent with negative selection purging strong regulatory variants within species, particularly variants that regulate the expression of genes whose precise regulation is essential.</p><p>The eQTL mapping approach allows us to connect genetic variants to the genes they regulate, and provides a mechanistic explanation for a portion of the heritability of gene expression phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Price et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wright et al., 2014</xref>). However, not all gene expression variation can be explained by genetic variation, and of the genetic contribution, only about 20% of heritability can be explained by locally acting variants (referred to as <italic>cis</italic> eQTLs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Price et al., 2011</xref>). We assume that the remaining 80% of heritable expression variation is determined by distally acting regulatory variants (<italic>trans</italic> eQTLs). However, because <italic>trans</italic> eQTLs can be located anywhere in the genome, they are difficult to pinpoint, even in studies with large sample sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Battle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Westra et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, regarding the identification of genes undergoing stabilizing selection within or between closely related species, the insights gained by <italic>cis</italic> eQTL approaches may be limited.</p><p>A third approach to understanding the evolutionary forces on gene expression is to directly quantify the degree of total gene expression variation (i.e. the variability) within or between populations or species. The variability of gene expression in a population is the sum of variability introduced by local and distal genetic regulation, as well as other sources, including epigenetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bashkeel et al., 2019</xref>) and environmental effects. The variability in gene expression observed in a given population is the result of all of these effects as well as any technical variability that was introduced during experimental data collection. While variability measurements alone cannot help disentangle the genetic component of variability from the non-genetic component, we do expect that natural selection will minimize the regulatory variation of genes with dosage-sensitive functions. Fortunately, it is possible to obtain relatively stable measurements of population variability for every expressed gene using a moderate sample size of just tens of individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Jong et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The quantification of regulatory variability may provide a window into distinct biological phenomena that are difficult to ascertain by studying inter-species differences in mean expression levels. For example, the adaptability of a population in response to new stresses may be a general function of gene expression variability, as has been demonstrated in yeast populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bódi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang and Zhang, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, identification of hypervariable genes, regardless of the genetic or non-genetic source of variability, may help identify genes and pathways which confer differences in disease susceptibilities and treatment responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Knowles et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Simonovsky et al., 2019</xref>). Direct measurements of variability may therefore be a useful complement to the analysis of differences in mean gene expression levels or to eQTL mapping, and could contribute to a better understanding of gene expression evolution and complex traits.</p><p>A previous analysis of gene expression variability within and between human populations found higher regulatory variation in genes associated with disease susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2010</xref>). This study did not otherwise identify any particular functional classes or features of genes that showed significant inter-population differences in expression variability – although given the relative genetic similarity, short evolutionary timescale, and migrations between human populations, we might not expect different signatures of selection to be apparent. Nonetheless, this study found that regulatory variability across genes correlates with the levels of genetic variability at nearby loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2010</xref>), thereby providing some measure of support to the notion that differences in regulatory variability between genes is at least partly genetically encoded.</p><p>We sought to better understand selection pressures on gene regulation variability by collecting gene expression data from humans and chimpanzees (<italic>Pan troglodytes</italic>). The availability of suitable samples from chimpanzees has notoriously been a limitation for comparative functional genomic studies. Here, we were able to collect the largest population sample of chimpanzee primary tissues to date, allowing not only for sensitive assessment of differences in mean expression levels between species, but also differences in variability within species. To better isolate the genetic component of variability, we complemented the analysis of gene expression levels with a comparative eQTL mapping approach.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We analyzed RNA-seq data from postmortem primary heart tissue samples of 39 human and 39 chimpanzee individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Data from 11 of these humans and 18 of the chimpanzees were previously collected in our lab and published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pavlovic et al., 2018</xref>). We obtained additional human data from the GTEx consortium (post-mortem heart, left ventricle), filtering for high quality samples with sufficient read depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>, see Materials and methods for filtering criteria). To complement the published data from chimpanzees, we generated new RNA-seq data from primary heart samples of 21 additional chimpanzee individuals (see Materials and methods). Because the data were collected at different times, and some of the data from humans were collected in different labs (the GTEx data), our overall study design introduces clear technical batch effects that are partly confounded with species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Our focus, however, is on inter-species comparisons of gene expression variability and eQTLs, which are estimated and identified using the within-species data. The batch effects are therefore expected to have only a minimal impact on the reported results.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Summary of RNA-seq datasets.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Number of reads mapped to expressed genes for each sample.

Using these mapped reads, we estimated gene expression levels for each individual in each species. We excluded lowly expressed genes (see Materials and methods), and retained data from 13,432 expressed genes for further analysis. Principle component analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and unsupervised clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) of the data show that, as expected, samples primarily separate by species, and not by source or batch, although as we pointed out, some technical batches are partly confounded with species in this study.</p><p>Using a linear model framework (see Materials and methods), we identified 8880 differentially expressed (DE) genes between species (FDR &lt; 0.05), including 6,409 DE genes with effect sizes smaller than a twofold change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As our comparative sample size is unusually large, we have an opportunity to comment on the robustness of observations that are made using study designs with smaller sample sizes, which are more typical for comparative studies in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Khan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pavlovic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Perry et al., 2012</xref>). To do so, we subsampled our data and repeated the DE analysis for various sample sizes and read depths. To benchmark the results, we used the effect size estimates and DE gene classifications of the full dataset as an ad hoc gold standard reference.</p><p>As expected, we found that the number of individuals, not sequencing depth (within the range of 10M to &gt;25M reads per sample), is the primary driver of power to detect inter-species differences in gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F–O</xref>). Our results indicate that while comparative studies with small sample sizes are underpowered, their reports of differentially expressed genes are generally robust. For example, when we used a sample size of only four chimpanzee individuals and four human individuals, we identified a median of 1,373 (869–2131 interquartile range across 100 resamples) DE genes (FDR &lt; 0.05), or just 15% (10–24% IQR) of the genes identified as DE in the analysis of the full set of samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Furthermore, a study with only four individuals from each species is particularly underpowered to identify subtle inter-species differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>), only capturing a median of 5% (2–12% IQR) of the DE genes with effect sizes smaller than a twofold change. In addition, of the DE genes identified at this sample size, the estimated magnitude effect sizes are typically upwardly biased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>) due to the winner’s curse effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Göring et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ioannidis, 2008</xref>), which particularly affect under-powered study designs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). However, even at this small sample size, the false positive rate associated with the classification of DE genes is well calibrated; when we used an FDR of 5% to classify genes as DE between the species, we empirically estimated a median of 2% (1–5% IQR) false discoveries based on the gold standard reference. Similar analyses for study designs with different sample sizes are available in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>Considering that some of the chimpanzees we collected data from are first-degree relatives, we wondered if the presence of highly related chimpanzee samples plays a meaningful role in the interspecies DE comparisons. To examine that, we identified subsample sets of chimpanzees with varying degrees of inter-relatedness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>). We then estimated the proportion of variance in gene expression that may be explained by relatedness. We found that technical factors, such as RNA extraction batch, play a larger role in explaining gene expression variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C–D</xref>) than the inter-relatedness. Furthermore, we repeated the DE analysis procedures with subsamples of only the inter-related chimpanzee individuals, and did not find any meaningful difference in number of DE genes or estimated false discovery rate compared to subsamples of less related individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E–F</xref>). We conclude that the presence of inter-related samples plays a minimal role in altering interspecies DE analyses. The extrapolation of these analyses to guide interspecies study designs in relation to other factors such as tissue type and species, is not clear. Yet, we reason that tissue types that are more homogenous with less variability within species will naturally require fewer samples to detect similar effect sizes. Conversely, species comparisons that are more highly diverged, will likely have larger true effect size differences, and may require fewer samples to acquire meaningful results.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterizing variability in gene expression</title><p>The main focus of our study was to assess and compare the inter-individual variability in gene expression between the two species. To do so, we estimated overdispersion for each gene in chimpanzees and humans separately (see Materials and methods). Briefly, we assumed that the measurement process is captured by Poisson sampling, and that true gene expression follows a Gamma distribution. These assumptions are supported by theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pachter, 2011</xref>) and empirical data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marioni et al., 2008</xref>). Accordingly, we used a negative binomial regression model to fit the RNA-seq data (22,23). Fitting the model to the data from each gene yields estimates of the mean and biological variance of gene expression, which result in the overdispersion of the observed read counts relative to a Poisson distribution.</p><p>Consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ecker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eling et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>), we observed that overdispersion is strongly correlated with mean expression, due to reasons which may be technical or biological in nature. To understand the properties of gene expression variability that are independent of mean gene expression level, we regressed out the mean from the overdispersion estimates, to obtain a gene-wise mean-corrected summary of variability, hereafter referred to as ‘dispersion’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). A dispersion greater than 0 indicates more variability than expected given the gene’s expression level. Conceptually, our approach is similar to a method recently devised to identify differentially variable genes using single cell gene expression data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eling et al., 2018</xref>). Using this approach, one can identify genes whose inter-individual variance in expression is different, irrespective of their mean or median expression levels. For example, while the genes <italic>TERF2</italic> and <italic>SNORD14E</italic> have similar median expression levels, <italic>TERF2</italic> has a lower dispersion than <italic>SNORD14E,</italic> in both species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We used a bootstrap test (Materials and methods) to assess the stability of dispersion estimates and identified genes whose estimated dispersion is significantly different between species. For example, <italic>ZNF514</italic> has higher dispersion in humans than chimpanzees, despite being similarly expressed in both species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In total, we identified 2658 inter-species differentially dispersed genes (FDR &lt; 0.1). Inter-species differences in mean expression levels cannot explain this finding, as differentially dispersed genes are generally not differentially expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Gene variance independent of expression is correlated across species.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) To estimate dispersion, RNA-seq counts for 39 human heart tissue samples were used to estimate gene-wise mean (μ) and overdispersion (ϕ) parameters.

We asked what other gene properties may be associated with the degree of gene expression variability. Specifically, we hypothesized that highly conserved essential genes, whose coding regions evolve under strong negative selection, would also be less variable in their expression across individuals. Indeed, when we ranked and grouped genes by degree of protein coding conservation (assessed by percent amino acid identity between human and chimpanzee; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), or by the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous codon changes (dN/dS) across mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), we found that lower dispersion in expression levels is associated with higher protein coding conservation. This trend is most significant for genes in functional categories (Gene Ontology; GO categories) related to immune function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with immune-related genes being targets of rapid evolution by diversifying selection pressures, which may increase dispersion. To further establish the relationship between evolutionary coding conservation and dispersion, we utilized the prevalence of genetic diversity data from humans to categorize genes as loss-of-function-tolerant (ExAC pLI score &lt;0.1) or loss-of-function-intolerant (ExAC pLI score &gt;0.9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lek et al., 2016</xref>).

To do this, we ordered genes by their dispersion estimate in humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) or chimpanzees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>) and used gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>) to identify GO categories enriched at the top or bottom of the list. We found that genes with housekeeping functions universal to all cell-types, such as genes related to transcription initiation and tRNA modification, are among the most enriched gene categories associated with low dispersion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Conversely, genes with high dispersion are enriched for categories like fibrinolysis (the breakdown of blood clots), oxygen sensing, and other cardiovascular related functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Finally, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Jong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hagai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ravarani et al., 2016</xref>), we found that genes with TATA boxes are associated with higher dispersion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), potentially because TATA boxes are associated with higher transcriptional noise at the molecular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blake et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Raser and O'Shea, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ravarani et al., 2016</xref>). However, a possible technical explanation for this observation is that TATA box genes are enriched among cell-type-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schug et al., 2005</xref>) and cell-type heterogeneity between individuals or samples could contribute to the observed dispersion.</p><p>To investigate the possibility that differences in cell composition between samples contribute to our observations of gene expression dispersion, we first asked whether dispersion is associated with the degree of cell-type-specificity of expression. We hypothesized that genes with high inter-individual dispersion are more likely to have cell-type-specific gene expression signatures in single-cell RNA-seq datasets of heart tissue. To examine this we turned to the <italic>Tabula Muris</italic> dataset, a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomics dataset which includes single-cell RNA-seq data from adult mouse heart tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tabula Muris Consortium et al., 2018</xref>). Qualitatively, we observed that the most highly dispersed genes in our bulk chimpanzee and human samples have more cell-type-specific expression among the nine heart cell types identified in <italic>Tabula Muris</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Conversely, the lowest dispersed genes are more evenly expressed across cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). More generally, when we summarized the level of cell-type-specific expression for each gene as a single summary statistic, τ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kryuchkova-Mostacci and Robinson-Rechavi, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yanai et al., 2005</xref>), we found that dispersion is strongly correlated with cell-type-specificity (R = 0.32, p&lt;2×10<sup>−16</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Notably, the degree of cell-type-specificity is derived from data from mouse hearts, which may have diverged cell type expression profiles compared with primates.

Furthermore, using estimates of expression profiles within each cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), we calculated dispersion for human and chimpanzee within each cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>). We found that the deconvoluted expression profiles for different cell types cluster tightly by cell type rather than species, as expected. Interestingly, the dispersion estimates cluster in a complex pattern that is more strongly influenced by species. This is consistent with the idea that genetic variation, which nearly completely segregates by species, plays a meaningful role is explaining dispersion when cell composition variation is corrected for. Put together, these analyses indicate that the levels of inter-individual dispersion we observed in humans and chimpanzees, and the high similarity in dispersion observed across species, are driven genetic differences as well as cell type heterogeneity between samples. The cell type heterogeneity across samples may be partly due to both technical differences between sample preparations, as well as biological differences between individuals.</p><p>To investigate the extent to which the cell composition differences that drive dispersion are biologically relevant, as opposed to technical differences in tissue dissection and sample preparation, we turned to cell deconvolution profiles of samples from anatomically different heart samples from matched individuals from GTEx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Donovan et al., 2020</xref>). We reasoned that if intentionally anatomically different heart sections (left ventricle, versus atrial appendage) from the same individual correlate better than matched tissue samples from different individuals, then the cell type composition differences across our chimpanzee samples are also likely driven by individual level differences, rather than technical differences in sample acquisition.</p><p>We found that the estimated fraction of cardiac muscle cells, the most common cell type in both tissue sections, is highly correlated between atrial appendage and left ventricle samples from matched individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We used a linear mixed model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hoffman and Schadt, 2016</xref>) to quantify the contribution of individual level versus tissue level factors to explain cell type composition estimates, and found that the individual level factor generally explains more variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We interpret this as strong evidence that the sample-to-sample differences captured by our dispersion estimates are driven largely by true differences between individuals, rather than random technical differences in sample acquisition and dissection.</p><p>Having more confidence that the dispersion estimates reflect true biological variability, we sought to characterize the differences in dispersion between chimpanzee and human. Importantly, we find that the interspecies <italic>difference</italic> in dispersion is much less likely to be driven by cell type heterogeneity, although there is a relatively small but significant correlation with τ (R = 0.07, p=2.2×10<sup>−12</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Conversely, we found that genes related to immune function are more variable in chimpanzee. We note that some of our chimpanzee individuals were sourced from laboratory settings and have been challenged with HBV or HCV viral infections. However, our GSEA results are robust to the exclusion of these samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4s3sdata1">Figure 4—figure supplement 3—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Within-species genetic variation contributes to inter-species differences in variability</title><p>Although potentially technical in nature, inter-individual differences in cellular composition provide a partial explanation for our observation of similar dispersion estimates across species. We looked for evidence that genetic diversity also drives dispersion. We asked whether inter-species differences in dispersion, which are much less likely to be explained by cellular composition, are associated with corresponding differences in selection pressures between the species. We reasoned that if inter-species differences in dispersion are partially driven by inter-species differences in selection pressures, we may see differences between the species in genetic signatures that are consistent with natural selection near the differentially dispersed genes. More specifically, we expect that genes with particularly low dispersion in human compared to chimpanzee will also display more constraint at the coding level in human than in chimpanzee. To assess this, we analyzed genotype data from our chimpanzee and human cohorts. We obtained human genotype data from the GTEx consortium, and chimpanzee data by performing high-coverage whole genome sequencing on the 39 chimpanzee samples used in this study (&gt;30X genome coverage obtained in all samples, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>); these data represent roughly a 50% increase in the number of high-coverage <italic>Pan troglodytes</italic> genomes currently available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Manuel et al., 2016</xref>).

Motivated by this notion, we searched for further evidence for genetic regulation of dispersion by identifying genes associated with eQTLs - eGenes - in both humans and chimpanzees. In humans, we obtained a list of 11,682 heart left ventricle eGenes identified by the GTEx consortium (with a sample size of 386 individuals). In chimpanzee, we used the genotype and expression data we collected to map <italic>cis</italic> eQTL SNPs within 250 kb of each of the 13,545 expressed genes. We included 10 principal components as covariates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) and accounted for genetic relatedness between individuals and population structure, which we inferred from the genotype data (Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Because gene expression principle components are correlated with cellular heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), their inclusion as covariates in the eQTL linear modeling helps correct for this heterogeneity and additional unobserved technical sources of variation.

However, this comparison is affected by the substantial difference in power to detect eQTLs between the large human sample used in GTEx and the relatively small chimpanzee sample we collected. To address this, we iteratively subsampled the human cohort to sample sizes comparable to our chimpanzee cohort, and re-mapped human eQTLs. When we compared lists of eGenes identified in humans and chimpanzees using similar sample sizes, we found a greater overlap of eGenes in the two species than expected by chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref>). This observation is robust even if we use the eQTL results of the full GTEx dataset, as long as we perform the comparison by using the largest-effect eQTLs (those that can be identified as significant even in smaller sample sizes). Specifically, of the top 500 significant GTEx eGenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3C</xref>), 21 are also found to be eGenes in chimpanzee (FDR &lt; 0.1), a significant enrichment (Odds Ratio = 2.05, p=0.003, hypergeometric test).

Because we know that gene expression variation in humans is often associated with genetic variation (in the form of eQTLs), we hypothesized that the degree of population variability in gene expression levels may reflect the evolutionary constraint on gene regulation. We reasoned that a comparison of regulatory variation in humans and chimpanzees, and a comparative eQTL study, may provide evidence to support said hypothesis and further identify inter-species similarities and differences in the selective pressures on gene expression.</p><p>We found that inter-individual expression variability is highly correlated in humans and chimpanzees. At first glance, this seems to support the notion that regulatory variation evolves under similar selective pressures in both species. However, we were unable to exclude a technical explanation for this observation. It was difficult to disentangle the genetic and non-genetic contributions of this variability because we used primary tissue samples that include multiple cell types. We found that, across genes, cell type heterogeneity is a major driver of the degree to which gene expression varies in the population. Because orthologous genes in human and chimpanzee are expected to have similar expression patterns, this finding can potentially explain the observation of high correlation in expression dispersion in the two species. Though this technical explanation may be intuitive, the degree of the association between population variability and the cellular specificity of gene expression may have been overlooked without the use of single-cell data.</p><p>Cell type heterogeneity has likely affected previous comparative studies of gene regulation that used primary tissue samples, including studies from our own lab. We and others have commented on this property of primary tissue comparisons in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avila Cobos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blekhman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Newman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Selewa et al., 2020</xref>), but without single cell data it was impossible to effectively assess the magnitude of this effect. Our findings further underscore the need for single cell measurements to disentangle sources of variation in bulk RNA-seq data, especially from primary tissues. Future work examining population variability should take this into account, possibly by collecting single cell data, to separate cell-type heterogeneity from heterogeneity within a particular cell type. It is important to account for cellular composition not only in comparative studies of variation in gene expression, but also in studies that focus on a single species. Indeed, cellular heterogeneity may itself have a genetic component, which will be confounded with regulatory differences within a cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Donovan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Marderstein et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Notwithstanding these complications, our observations do indicate that natural selection has played a role in shaping inter-species similarities and differences in gene expression variability. Differences in cellular composition cannot explain the observed correlation between dispersion and measures of nucleotide divergence and diversity. This was the first observation in our study that provided some measure of support for the hypothesis that regulatory variation may be a genetic trait. Although the inference of selection at the genomic level indicates selection on coding regions (not gene regulation), the correlation with the degree of variation in expression suggests that the regulation of functionally important genes is also a selected trait.</p><p>Encouraged by this finding, we were able to find more evidence to support our hypothesis by carrying out a comparative eQTL analysis. We identified eQTLs in humans by using the GTEx data, which sampled hundreds of individuals. In chimpanzee, we identified eQTLs by using our 39 samples. It is quite difficult to obtain chimpanzee primary tissue samples and although this sample size is modest, it is probably the largest population of chimpanzee primary tissue samples ever reported. The difference in sample size between the human and chimpanzee eQTL discovery panels means that observations of human-specific eGenes are quite expected and can often be explained by the fact that we have more power to detect eQTLs in humans. In contrast, the observation of chimpanzee-specific eGenes is quite meaningful because it is much less likely that the human sample was underpowered to detect eQTLs for said genes if they existed.</p><p>With that in mind, our observation that species-specific eGenes have higher variability in the species in which the eQTL was detected is significant, because it directly points to a genetic basis for differences in expression dispersion between humans and chimpanzees. This observation is also consistent with the notion that genetic variation within species contributes to the overall inter-species divergence in gene regulation. This is a critical piece of evidence supporting our hypothesis, although we acknowledge that under some complicated scenarios, one could evoke cellular composition as a potential explanation for this observation as well. We argue, however, that this would require inter-species differences in cellular composition to segregate with dozens of genotypes in just one species, and for these genotypes to appear as <italic>cis</italic> eQTLs for genes that have higher divergence due to cellular composition. The requirement for the genotypes to correlate with the difference in cellular composition while also being in proximity to the specific set of eGenes that would satisfy the divergence requirement is extremely unlikely, although we cannot offer empirical data to entirely exclude this possibility. That said, we also observed stronger signals of coding selection for non-eGenes than eGenes in both species, further suggesting selection on the eGenes themselves (this is not expected if our observations are to be explained by differences in cellular composition).</p><p>Collectively, our observations suggest that, across species, eQTLs may be a subtle indicator of dosage insensitivity for relatively neutrally evolving genes. Thus, we believe that an inter-species analysis of population variability in gene expression may be a relatively simple way to complement existing methods to assess differences in selection pressures between lineages. Interestingly, the eGenes we identified only in chimpanzee, but not in human, are slightly enriched for transcription regulatory processes, reminiscent of a previous observation that transcription factors seem to be enriched among the genes positively selected for in the human lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blekhman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gilad et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In both human and chimpanzee, we found that genes involved in immune response are among the most variably expressed and strongly enriched among species-shared eGenes. This is consistent with a body of literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Croze et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ejsmond and Radwan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hagai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Shultz and Sackton, 2019</xref>) that points to diversifying selective pressure on immune related cell-surface receptor genes to identify and combat diverse and ever-evolving pathogens. A prime example of this is the abundance of MHC complex genes among the most variable genes in both species, and strongly enriched in the subset of shared eGenes. However, the extent to which quantitative regulation of gene expression is functionally important to pathogen defense and thus the target of selection is unclear. Alternatively, these regulatory variants may be hitchhiking with functionally important and tightly linked coding variants under strong positive or balancing selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">D'Antonio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Meyer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shiina et al., 2009</xref>). If non-coding trans-species polymorphisms are targets of long lived balancing selection on gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Johnsen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Leffler et al., 2013</xref>), we expect these polymorphisms to display similar eQTL effects in both species. However, we failed to identify generally conserved regulatory effects of trans-species polymorphisms. Although we found clear instances of regulatory effects from some of these trans-species SNPs in humans, we note that this human dataset is well powered enough to detect similar regulatory effects even from random control SNPs. The cumulative regulatory effects of trans-species polymorphisms are not significantly different than the control SNPs. We acknowledge that we may be underpowered to detect subtle conserved regulatory effects in chimpanzee. Moreover, some of these trans-species polymorphisms may have important regulatory functions; albeit this function may also be tissue-, cell-type-, or context-dependent and not present in our assessment of heart and other GTEx bulk tissues.</p><p>In summary, we performed a comparative assessment of expression variability and eQTL mapping and found signatures of stabilizing selection on gene regulation in both species. A deeper understanding of differences in selection on gene expression may be gained by further assessing mean differences, variability, and eQTL contributions in various tissue types across primate groups. Such studies may benefit from single-cell techniques, as we find strong contributions of cell-type heterogeneity in our analysis of variability, which may be biological or technical in nature.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Novel data generation</title><p>In total, 39 post-mortem heart tissue biopsies were collected from captive born chimpanzees, 18 of which have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pavlovic et al., 2018</xref>).

Fastq files for samples that were sequenced on multiple lanes were combined after confirmation that all gene expression profiles for all fastq files cluster primarily by sample and not by sequencing lane. GTEx-derived fastq files were trimmed to 75 bp single-end reads to match the non-GTEx sequencing data. Reads were aligned to the appropriate annotated genome (GRCh38.p13 or Pan_tro_3.0 from Ensembl release 95; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zerbino et al., 2018</xref>) using STAR aligner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>) default parameters. Only chromosomal contigs were considered for read alignment throughout this work. That is, unplaced contigs were excluded from the reference genome. Gene counts were obtained with subread featureCounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liao et al., 2014</xref>) using a previously described annotation file of human-chimpanzee orthologous exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pavlovic et al., 2018</xref>). The gene expression matrix was converted to CountsPerMillion (CPM) with edgeR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>) to normalize reads to library size. The mean-variance trend was estimated using limma-voom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>). Genes with less than 6 CPM in all samples were excluded from further analysis. This cutoff was chosen based on visual inspection of the voom mean-variance trend to identify where the trend becomes unstable. To normalize differences in orthologous exonic gene size between human and chimpanzee, we converted the log(CPM) matrix to log(RPKM) based on the species-specific length of orthologous exonic regions. We then visually inspected PCA plots and hierarchical clustering to identify potential outliers and batch effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We note that although all the chimpanzee RNA isolation and sequencing were prepared separately from GTEx heart samples, PCA and clustering analysis suggest that the inter-species differences vastly outweigh the technical batch effects (based on the inter-species but within-batch samples sourced from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pavlovic et al., 2018</xref>). The dataset of 49 human samples and 39 chimpanzee samples was culled to 39 human and 39 chimpanzee samples based on exclusion of 5 obvious human outliers which did not cluster with the rest and had among the lowest read depths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>).

Clusters were determined using 'hclust' and 'cutree' functions in R with k = 7 clusters and defaults for other parameters. This resulted in the seven clusters depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, which were further culled into three clusters of comparable size (each of size n = 4) with relatively high inter-relatedness, and one cluster (n = 13) with relatively low inter-relatedness. Specifically, sample 529 in the purple cluster was dropped as it had the lowest mean intra-cluster pairwise kinship coefficient. Conversely, six samples were dropped from the red cluster based on the presence of a high intra-cluster pairwise kinship coefficient which indicate first degree relatives. The VarianceParition R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hoffman and Schadt, 2016</xref>) was used implement a linear mixed model to assess the contribution of the cluster annotations (which we interpret as a proxy for inter-relatedness), RNA extraction batch, and sex (each as random effects) to explaining logRPKM gene expression for each gene. We also used the cluster groupings to empirically evaluate the degree to which highly inter-related subsamples contribute to DE power: More specifically, the same power analysis procedure described above was used to empirically assess the number of DE genes and false positive rate using four human samples (samples 63145, 62606, 59167, 59263, which were all derived from the same technical batch), and four chimpanzee samples, each drawn without replacement from within a cluster of varying degrees of inter-relatedness.

Sample-specific statistics for basic data processing steps, including read alignment and variant calling, are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>. PCR duplicates were removed via Picard tools. Low-complexity regions of the genome were determined using dustmasker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Morgulis et al., 2006</xref>) with default settings and excluded from variant calling. Sites where any sample had coverage (after PCR duplicate removal) outside of d+3√d and d+4√d coverage (where d is the sample average fold coverage across the genome) were also excluded, as these regions are enriched for duplicated or paralogous regions which are prone to false heterozygous variant calls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li, 2014</xref>).

After excluding this individual and re-performing eQTL mapping (n = 38), visual inspection of a QQ-plot of p-values compared to permuted null data (where the sample labels for expression and covariates were randomly assigned to genotype) indicates inflation of small p-values, and that p-values are well calibrated under the permuted null (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To obtain gene-level p-values that test whether a gene contains an eQTL (eGenes) we used EigenMT, a method which approximates permutation testing procedures to account for multiple testing of linked SNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davis et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Cis eQTL mapping (human)</title><p>We downloaded gene-level (eGene) summary statistics for Heart_Left_ventricle GTEx v8 from GTEx portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gtexportal.org/">https://gtexportal.org/</ext-link>). The summary statistics from this mapping pipeline only considers expressed genes, which are defined as &gt;0.1 TPM in at least 20% of samples and ≥6 reads in at least 20% of samples. The analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref> required more than summary statistics. We downloaded normalized phenotypes, covariates, and genotypes for GTEx v8 data for Heart_Left_ventricle and remapped eGenes using varying sample sizes using a mapping pipeline nearly identical to GTEx. Namely, we used FastQTL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ongen et al., 2016</xref>) on the supplied data with randomly selected individuals corresponding to sample sizes (n) of 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 160, 200. Similar to guidelines described by GTEx (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gtexportal.org/">https://gtexportal.org/</ext-link>), we included only 10 PEER factor covariates for n = 40, 15 for 40 &gt; n &gt; 150, or 30 for n &gt; 150.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Gene-wise conservation statistics</title><p>Gene-wise amino acid percent identity between chimpanzee and human was obtained from BioMart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kinsella et al., 2011</xref>). Gene-wise pan-mammal dN/dS for each gene was obtained from a previous study that used alignments from 29 mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lindblad-Toh et al., 2011</xref>). P<sub>n</sub>/P<sub>s</sub> was calculated from all GTEx v8 genotype data and the union of all <italic>Pan troglodyte</italic> genotypes available in this study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Manuel et al., 2016</xref>. Specifically, Ensembl vep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McLaren et al., 2016</xref>) was used to annotate coding variants with MAF &gt;0.1 as synonymous or non-synonymous to tabulate Pn (number of polymorphic non-synonymous sites) and Ps (number of polymorphic synonymous sites) for each gene within each species. After requiring that genes have at least one polymorphism in both species, a pseudocount of 0.5 was added to both Pn and Ps for each gene for both species to avoid division-by-zero errors. TATA box genes were classified as genes with a TATA motif within 35 bp of a transcription initiation site from published transcription initiation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abugessaisa et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>eQTL-mapping of shared polymorphisms</title><p>263 SNPs among 125 regions that are trans-species polymorphisms between chimpanzee and humans were obtained from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Leffler et al., 2013</xref>. Each trans-species polymorphic <italic>region</italic> contains at least two trans-species SNPs to ensure regions are identical by descent rather than recurrent mutation of an isolated SNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Leffler et al., 2013</xref>). Only SNPs with MAF &gt;0.1 in our datasets were further utilized, leaving 192 SNPs in chimpanzee, 196 SNPs in human (GTEx), and 144 SNPs (amongst 76 regions) tested for eQTL activity in both species. For each test SNP, a matched control SNP was randomly chosen for each species with the criteria that it should have a matching allele frequency (±5% MAF), within 100 kb of the test SNP, and unlinked to the test SNP (R<sup>2</sup> &lt;0.2, LD calculated with plink). We used MatrixEQTL to retest these SNPs for <italic>cis</italic> eQTL activity (1 MB window) using MatrixEQTL with the same normalized gene expression matrix, GRM matrix (for chimpanzee only), and covariates described above for chimpanzee and human <italic>cis</italic> eQTL mapping. The effect sizes between species occasionally had to be re-polarized to relate to the same allele, as the effect sizes obtained from eQTL testing software is often polarized by minor allele or by reference vs non-reference allele, although the minor allele and/or reference allele at these trans-species polymorphisms is not always the same between species.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Gene set enrichment analysis</title><p>Gene set enrichment and gene ontology overlap analysis was performed with clusterProfiler R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). The GSEA test was performed with an ordered gene list using the 'gseGO' function with 1,000,000 permutations. As ordering genes was not applicable to inter-species eGene classifications, the 'enrichGO' function was used to perform gene ontology overlap analysis (hypergeometric test) with foreground and background gene sets based on eGene classifications. To quantify the correlation between dN/dS and dispersion for different GO sets, we obtained dN/dS annotations as described above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lindblad-Toh et al., 2011</xref>) and gene set annotations from MSigDB v7.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liberzon et al., 2011</xref>). We tested all gene sets with dN/dS and dispersion estimates for at least five genes in the gene set using Spearman’s test, adjusting for multiple testing with the Storey’s Q-value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Storey and Tibshirani, 2003</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Natalia Gonzales, Michelle Ward, Ittai Eres, and other members of the Gilad lab for helpful analysis discussions and comments on the manuscript.

heritable variation in gene expression, which is associated with disease susceptibility. In contrast to many other studies that have focused on mapping associations between genetic and gene regulatory variation, the current work addresses group dispersion/variance of gene expression among samples as well as the evolutionary processes that shape differences in gene expression between individuals, in both humans and chimpanzees. Using computational deconvolution, the authors demonstrate that cell-type heterogeneity is an important component of expression variability, with significant overlap of orthologous genes associated with eQTLs in both species. The conclusion is that gene expression variability in humans and chimpanzees often evolves under similar evolutionary pressures.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Gene expression variability in human and chimpanzee populations share common determinants&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Charles G Danko (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a solid study, with a large sample size, identifying quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in humans and chimpanzees, using gene expression data from primary heart samples. The authors complemented the analysis of gene expression with a comparative eQTL mapping, as opposed to relying on mean expression levels, as most comparative studies like this one do. Also unlike many studies focused on mapping associations between genetic and gene regulatory variation, the authors paid attention to the group dispersion/variance of gene expression among samples as well as the evolutionary processes that shape the differences in gene regulation between individuals. The calculation of power for discovering differentially expressed genes as a function of sample size at the beginning of the paper is a thoughtful analysis that is useful to many in the community. All of the analyses are extremely thorough and well-executed. The statistical tests are appropriate and rigorous. Results are interpreted in a conservative fashion.</p><p>The main limitation is that the authors are not able to conclusively disambiguate between different causes of dispersion. Genetics, cell type, and technical variation may all contribute to dispersion. The authors state this very clearly throughout the manuscript. In part, this may reflect the authors' underselling their results somewhat. But in part, this really does reflect reality: Cell type is a major confounder that may provide false signals in other analyses.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>The reviewers suggested a number of potential additions to clarify current results or build upon them. I will leave it up to the authors to decide which are worth including in their revision.</p><p>1) The first test authors conducted is to identify differentially variable (DV) genes. A total of 2658 DV genes were identified. The problem of the result is that almost equal number of up- and down-regulated DV genes symmetrically distributed around DV=0. Often, this is an indication of a lack of biological signals in data analysis. This might be due to the pooling of gene groups with diverse functionality together. Therefore, this reviewer suggests that authors should break down genes into subgroups to detail the up and down-regulatory patterns with the hope that some of the gene groups give interpretable results</p><p>2) The second test is to correlate the higher coding sequence conservation with lower dispersion. Again, the positive result is not unexpected. There are many indirect and/or confounding factors that may explain the effect. This reviewer, however, understands it is impossible to control them all (also authors have attempted to address some of them in the next few tests). However, here it is better to add exploratory analyses for genes in different functional groups and also give examples of outlier genes that do not follow the rule.</p><p>3) The third test is to examine the correlation between gene expression variability with single-cell type heterogeneity of samples. Authors first used Tabula Muris dataset to show dispersion is strongly correlated with cell-type specificity/diversity. If this is true, then the point that authors really wanted to demonstrate is, in fact, hampered. Authors might really want to show the &quot;true&quot; single-cell variability (see, for example, PMID: 31861624) is correlated with the level of group variance of gene expression.</p><p>4) The fourth test authors conducted is to show that dN/dS and P<sub>n</sub>/P<sub>s</sub> ratios of genes are correlated with gene expression variability (variance). However, because of the existence of heterogeneity of cell-type composition in samples, any correlation observed may be utterly biased by this single uncontrollable confounding factor. Furthermore, heart tissues contain an over-abundant expression of genes encoded in the mitochondrial genome. The expression level of these mt-genes may vary substantially between samples and reflect the health status of primary sample donors. PEER normalization may have to take this into account as a covariant.</p><p>5) Several other tests authors performed are around eQTLs (eGene overlap and eSNP overlap) between the two species. These are typical tests evolutionary biologists usually try to do whenever data are available. However, the issues with these types of tests are the low power in general. More importantly, in order to be consistent with previous tests which are all around the explanation of gene expression variance, this part should address the overlap between expression vQTLs in humans and chimps.</p><p>6) I would like to see more discussion about the inter-relatedness of the chimpanzees in the analysis of gene expression. Is that contributing to the power of the DE analysis, which has really high numbers of DE genes. That may certainly be due to the large samples size, but should be addressed. Related to that, the support that the gene-wise dispersion estimates are well correlated in humans and chimpanzees overall (Figure 1C, and Figure 2—figure supplement 1) seems qualitative. It looks like the chimpanzees might have less dispersion overall?</p><p>7) What do the authors think these findings mean for study systems outside of humans and captive chimpanzees? Both on the technical level (e.g. sample size), and for how their approach could be helpful outside of these species. Generalizing this approach would broaden the impact and audience of the paper.</p><p>8) Did the authors test directly whether eQTLs were enriched in genes with a high dispersion? I could not find this going back through the paper. This seems almost trivially likely to be true. I may have missed this result? Or did the authors worry this is too likely to be confounded with cell type? Either way, this seems like a result that may be useful to show even if the authors did acknowledge that it was likely to be confounded.</p><p>9) Did the authors consider looking for cell-type QTLs? They state several times in the paper the possibility that genetic factors may influence cell types. They have enough data – at least in human – to obtain QTLs for specific cell types, as others have done (Marderstein et al., 2020; Donovan et al., 2020). If these cell type QTLs were enriched near genes with a high dispersion, this may bolster the author's argument that genetic factors underlie dispersion by affecting cell type composition.</p><p>10) The scRNA-seq reference used for estimating cell types in heart tissue was derived from mice. Could this lead the authors to underestimate the degree to which cell types drive dispersion in genes that are variable between human and chimp? Genes that are variable between human/ chimp may also be more likely to be variable between either species and mouse, and perhaps this variability has led to them becoming more/ less of a marker of a specific cell population (and hence their dispersion in primates does not correlate with cell type specificity in mouse).</p><p>11) Have the authors tried estimating dispersion on top of what is expected based on differences in cell type? There are several strategies that might work for this: There are new strategies for estimating a posterior of cell type specific expression from a bulk sample, conditional on scRNA-seq data as prior information (Chu and Danko, 2020). These cell type specific expression estimates could then be analyzed for dispersion. Alternatively, it may also work to regress the estimated proportion of each cell type out of the dispersion estimates. While there are certainly a lot of pitfalls with using these strategies, especially in the setting shown here (all of this would work better if there were species matched reference data), they might provide an avenue for depleting the contribution of cell type differences from dispersion estimates.</p><p>12) Can the authors add a dotted line to show the shape of the distribution for genes with low dispersion, or where dispersion is shared in both human and chimpanzee, in Figure 4B? Is this different from genes that are dispersed in either chimp or human?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59929.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>The reviewers suggested a number of potential additions to clarify current results or build upon them.

For example, it is well established that among inter-species differentially expressed genes in practically any comparison that was done to date, about half the genes have elevated expression levels and about half have decreased expression.</p><p>That said, we provide the analysis suggested by the reviewer (revised manuscript Figure 4—figure supplement 3). We performed GSEA enrichment to identify which gene categories are preferentially DV-up or DV-down between chimpanzee and human. We found immune related genes with higher dispersion in chimpanzee, and mitosis related genes with higher dispersion in humans. As described in the manuscript, our interpretation is that this partly reflects differences in life histories in the human population, from which many individuals have suffered cardiac ischemia and may have differentially expressed mitosis related genes as a response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The second test is to correlate the higher coding sequence conservation with lower dispersion.

In the revised version, we provide a new analysis (revised manuscript Figure 3—figure supplement 1) in which we test for a correlation between higher coding sequence conservation (dN/dS metric) with lower dispersion on a GO category basis.

This comment is similar to reviewer point 11, and we provide description of a new analysis to address this point in our response to point 11 (please read below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The fourth test authors conducted is to show that dN/dS and P<sub>n</sub>/P<sub>s</sub> ratios of genes are correlated with gene expression variability (variance). However, because of the existence of heterogeneity of cell-type composition in samples, any correlation observed may be utterly biased by this single uncontrollable confounding factor.

Obviously, dN/dS and P<sub>n</sub>/P<sub>s</sub> are based on genotypes, and as such are orthogonal to gene expression based measurements from tissues (because all cell types from the same individual have the same genotypes). Given this, how can these measurements be biased by cell composition?</p><p>The second point – that mt-genes may be important markers of cellular or organismal fitness that might be important to correct for – is an interesting possibility and we further investigated it. Here, (Author response image1) we show that the first 10 gene expression principal components, which we include as covariates in the eQTL linear models, explain a nearly identical fraction of the total variance whether or not we include mt-genes in the gene expression matrix (the exact comparison is PCs from a gene expression matrix in which MT-genes are included, versus one where the median expression of MT-genes is set to the median across all samples, simulating zero variance contributed by MT-genes). Therefore, we believe our original principal component covariates are sufficient to capture the mitochondrial gene expression expression components that may reflect health status, and we did not alter the eQTL model or results from those in our original submission.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-59929-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Several other tests authors performed are around eQTLs (eGene overlap and eSNP overlap) between the two species. These are typical tests evolutionary biologists usually try to do whenever data are available. However, the issues with these types of tests are the low power in general. More importantly, in order to be consistent with previous tests which are all around the explanation of gene expression variance, this part should address the overlap between expression vQTLs in humans and chimps.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that eGene overlap analyses are limited by power, as eQTL analyses often require much larger sample sizes to detect modest eQTL effects. While we are fundamentally limited by the data available to us, we do address the overlap between dispersion and eGenes (revised Figure 6B, Figure 6—figure supplement 4). Unfortunately addressing any potential inter-species overlap with varianceQTLs (vQTLs) would require sample sizes larger than we can obtain. For example, [Sarkar et al., PLoS Genet. 2019] suggests a sample sizes in the thousands required to identify genetic variants that explain variance independent of mean expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) I would like to see more discussion about the inter-relatedness of the chimpanzees in the analysis of gene expression. Is that contributing to the power of the DE analysis, which has really high numbers of DE genes. That may certainly be due to the large samples size, but should be addressed. Related to that, the support that the gene-wise dispersion estimates are well correlated in humans and chimpanzees overall (Figure 1C, and Figure 2—figure supplement 1) seems qualitative. It looks like the chimpanzees might have less dispersion overall?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the good suggestion regarding the contribution of inter-related chimpanzees to DE analysis. We performed a set of new analyses to address this (revised manuscript Figure 1—figure supplement 3). First, we identified clusters of our chimpanzee samples based on genetic relatedness, identifying groups of inter-related chimpanzees and unrelated chimpanzees as test and control groups to investigate further. We note that qualitatively, the genomewide expression measurements of chimpanzee individuals that are more closely related are not more similar than that of unrelated individuals, likely due to confounding factors in the data, such as the batch effect of RNA isolation or other technical effects. We further used the VariancePartition R package to quantify the effects of inter-relatedness and technical batch effects, finding that technical batch effects likely have a greater effect on gene expression and DE analysis. Finally, we empirically address this question by reperforming DE analysis with the test (inter-related chimpanzee samples) and control (unrelated samples) and quantifying the number of DE genes and estimated false positive rate. We do not find any meaningful differences that would point to inter-related samples having effects of the similar magnitude as the technical batch effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) What do the authors think these findings mean for study systems outside of humans and captive chimpanzees? Both on the technical level (e.g. sample size), and for how their approach could be helpful outside of these species. Generalizing this approach would broaden the impact and audience of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Referring to our analysis of DE power, this is an excellent question, but empirically answering this question is outside the scope of this paper so we can only speculate. Though, we reason that our findings may depend on the species comparison (species which have diverged more may have greater differences, and thus a similarly sized study may identify more differences), and the tissue type (tissues with high inter-individual variability due to technical or environmental factors may have less power). We have added a discussion of this in the revised manuscript. Further, we provide an analysis of GTEx tissues which quantifies the variability (gene-wise overdispersion parameter estimate measured from a negative binomial) across GTEx samples for different tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>, top). We note that the median amount of population overdispersion within a tissue negatively correlates with the number of eGenes detected in GTEx (independent of GTEx sample size, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> bottom left, bottom right). We believe this may serve as a reference as to which tissues may have more power in DE analysis or eQTL analysis due to the degree of inter-individual variability. We have decided not to include this analysis in the main manuscript as we feel it does not easily fit into the focus of existing narrative on inter-species differences in variability and eQTLs.</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-59929-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Did the authors test directly whether eQTLs were enriched in genes with a high dispersion? I could not find this going back through the paper. This seems almost trivially likely to be true. I may have missed this result? Or did the authors worry this is too likely to be confounded with cell type? Either way, this seems like a result that may be useful to show even if the authors did acknowledge that it was likely to be confounded.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes. As the reviewer hypothesizes, eQTL containing genes (eGenes) have higher dispersion than non-eGenes. We have added a new figure (revised manuscript Figure 6—figure supplement 4) to show this. Related to this point, in the initial submission we showed that the genes that are eGenes specifically in chimpanzee and not human, have higher dispersion in chimpanzee than human, and vice versa (revised manuscript Figure 6B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Did the authors consider looking for cell-type QTLs? They state several times in the paper the possibility that genetic factors may influence cell types. They have enough data – at least in human – to obtain QTLs for specific cell types, as others have done (Marderstein et al., 2020; Donovan et al., 2020). If these cell type QTLs were enriched near genes with a high dispersion, this may bolster the author's argument that genetic factors underlie dispersion by affecting cell type composition.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the good suggestion. Here, we performed the reviewer’s suggested analysis (Author response image3). We used cell composition estimates from [Donovan et al., 2020] on GTEx heart left ventricle samples and performed a genome-wide association study in an attempt to identify variants that associate with cell type composition (similar to [Marderstein et al., 2020]). We used a linear mixed model with a genetic relatedness matrix to account for ancestry, included sex as a covariate, and used the quantile normalized proportion of cardiac muscle cells as the response variable. No loci of achieved the standard GWAS stringent genome wide significance threshold of 5E-8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>, top), but nonetheless, we asked whether the top 100 loci (estimated FDR&lt;0.5) are closest to highly dispersed or lowly dispersed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>, lower left). Furthermore, under the hypothesis that eQTLs may reflect direct effects on cell type composition, we asked whether eQTLs (summary statistics obtained from GTEx) have inflated P-values for association with cell type composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>, lower right). We did not find any meaningful effect, suggesting that the GTEx mapping pipeline does a good job at accounting for cell type heterogeneity through PEER, and/or lack of power for detecting such cell type QTLs.</p><fig id="sa2fig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-59929-resp-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Our analysis in response to this point led us to an additional analysis which is not directly related to this reviewer’s point, but nonetheless we have included in the revised manuscript (revised manuscript Figure 4—figure supplement 2) and we will briefly summarize here: The cell type composition estimates from [Donovan et al., 2020] include all GTEx heart samples (from both left ventricle, and atrial appendage tissues, often from the same set of individuals). We used this as an opportunity to examine whether the gene expression variability due to cell type composition may have a strong genetic or individual component, as opposed to being a completely technical artifact of inconsistencies in tissue dissection and sample acquisition. We reasoned that if intentionally anatomically different heart sections (left ventricle, versus atrial appendage) from the same individual correlate better than matched tissue samples from different individuals, then the cell type composition differences across our chimpanzee samples likely are driven by individual level differences, rather than technical differences in sample acquisition. In Figure 4—figure supplement 1-A we show qualitatively that there is an obvious individual level correlation between the atrial appendage samples and left ventricle samples for matched individuals. We used a linear mixed model (implemented with VariancePartition R package) to quantify the contribution of individual level versus tissue level factors to cell type composition estimates, and find that the individual level factor generally explains more variance. We interpret this as strong evidence that the sample to sample differences captured by our dispersion estimates are driven largely by true differences between individuals, rather than random technical differences in sample acquisition and dissection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The scRNA-seq reference used for estimating cell types in heart tissue was derived from mice. Could this lead the authors to underestimate the degree to which cell types drive dispersion in genes that are variable between human and chimp? Genes that are variable between human/ chimp may also be more likely to be variable between either species and mouse, and perhaps this variability has led to them becoming more/ less of a marker of a specific cell population (and hence their dispersion in primates does not correlate with cell type specificity in mouse).</p></disp-quote><p>Good point! We agree that there is likely a general downwards bias (ie regression dilution) in the estimated effect of cell type specificity on dispersion in primates due to the cell type specificity estimates being based on mouse single cell data. We added this point in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Have the authors tried estimating dispersion on top of what is expected based on differences in cell type? There are several strategies that might work for this: There are new strategies for estimating a posterior of cell type specific expression from a bulk sample, conditional on scRNA-seq data as prior information (Chu and Danko, 2020). These cell type specific expression estimates could then be analyzed for dispersion. Alternatively, it may also work to regress the estimated proportion of each cell type out of the dispersion estimates. While there are certainly a lot of pitfalls with using these strategies, especially in the setting shown here (all of this would work better if there were species matched reference data), they might provide an avenue for depleting the contribution of cell type differences from dispersion estimates.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for helpful suggestion! Though we agree that there are naturally a lot of caveats to such an analysis (estimating cell type specific expression and dispersion from bulk based on a mouse reference), in the revised manuscript, we describe a new analysis (Figure 4—figure supplement 1) using the suggested methodology of [Chu and Danko, 2020]: After estimating cell type composition and expression on a per individual basis, we then estimated dispersion on a per cell type basis in both human and chimpanzee. We present the results as a correlation matrix with hierarchal clustering. We find that while cell type specific expression measurements cluster by cell type before species, cell type specific dispersion estimates cluster in a complex pattern that is more strongly influenced by species. We find this consistent with the idea that dispersion across a population of bulk samples is meaningfully influenced by both cell type composition and genetic effects. In other words, when you are able to correct for the cell type composition effects, or rather, to estimate dispersion within a controlled cell type, the influence of genetic effects is made more obvious. As such, the chimpanzee and human cell specific dispersion estimates cluster partly by species, as the variation due to genetic variants is expected to almost completely segregate by species.</p><p>Furthermore, as we felt the cell type decomposition step of this new analysis was unnecessarily redundant with the cell type decomposition estimates we previously presented using CIBERSORT algorithm, we replaced the original figure and methods description referencing CIBERSORT cell decompositions with the cell decomposition estimates from the methodology of [Chu and Danko, 2020] (revised manuscript Figure 4—figure supplement 2). The cell type proportion estimates between the two methods are generally well correlated (R<sup>2</sup>=.88 across all individuals and cell types) and the small discrepancies do not alter any primary conclusions of the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Can the authors add a dotted line to show the shape of the distribution for genes with low dispersion, or where dispersion is shared in both human and chimpanzee, in Figure 4B? Is this different from genes that are dispersed in either chimp or human?</p></disp-quote><p>We added a scatter plot inset in revised manuscript Figure 4B and Figure 4A to show the distribution dispersion estimates for the plotted genes in both human and chimp.</p></body></sub-article></article>
