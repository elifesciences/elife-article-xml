plants. AlaDC evolves from serine decarboxylase (SerDC) through neofunctionalization and has lower catalytic activity. However, lacking structure information hinders the understanding of the evolution of substrate specificity and catalytic activity. In this study, we solved the X-ray crystal structures of AlaDC from <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic> (CsAlaDC) and SerDC from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (AtSerDC). Tyr<sup>341</sup> of AtSerDC or the corresponding Tyr<sup>336</sup> of CsAlaDC is essential for their enzymatic activity. Tyr<sup>111</sup> of AtSerDC and the corresponding Phe<sup>106</sup> of CsAlaDC determine their substrate specificity. Both CsAlaDC and AtSerDC have a distinctive zinc finger and have not been identified in any other Group II PLP-dependent amino acid decarboxylases. Based on the structural comparisons, we conducted a mutation screen of CsAlaDC. The results indicated that the mutation of L110F or P114A in the CsAlaDC dimerization interface significantly improved the catalytic activity by 110% and 59%, respectively. Combining a double mutant of CsAlaDC<sup>L110F/P114A</sup> with theanine synthetase increased theanine production 672% in an <italic>in vitro</italic> system. This study provides the structural basis for the substrate selectivity and catalytic activity of CsAlaDC and AtSerDC and provides a route to more efficient biosynthesis of theanine.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>alanine decarboxylase</kwd><kwd>serine decarboxylase</kwd><kwd>substrate specificity</kwd><kwd>theanine</kwd><kwd>Camellia sinensis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019YFA0904100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gong</surname><given-names>Weimin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022YFF1003103</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wan</surname><given-names>Xiaochun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T2221005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gong</surname><given-names>Weimin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32072624</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Zhaoliang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Comparative structural analysis and biochemical characterization unraveled the mechanisms behind enzymatic substrate selectivity, leading to an amplified theanine yield through active mutant protein screening, thus refining strategies for theanine production.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tea is one of the most popular natural non-alcoholic beverages consumed worldwide. About 2 billion cups of tea are consumed worldwide daily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Drew, 2019</xref>). Theanine (γ-glutamylethylamide) is a unique non-protein amino acid and the most abundant free amino acid in tea plants (<italic>Camellia sinensis</italic>). It accounts for more than 50% of the total free amino acids and approximately 1–2% of the dry weight of the new shoots of tea plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Juneja et al., 1999</xref>). Theanine is the secondary metabolite conferring the umami taste of tea infusion and also balances the astringency and bitterness of tea infusion caused by catechins and caffeine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lin et al., 2022</xref>). It has also many health-promoting functions, including neuroprotective effects, enhancement of immune functions, and potential anti-obesity capabilities, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Juneja et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haskell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kakuda et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Takagi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zheng et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, theanine content is highly correlated with green tea quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lin et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Theanine is synthesized from EA and glutamate (Glu) by theanine synthetase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deng et al., 2009</xref>). Importantly, the large amount of theanine biosynthesis is determined by the high availability of EA in tea plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, the evolution of EA biosynthesis in tea plants provided the basis for theanine biosynthesis and the formation of tea quality. EA is synthesized from alanine decarboxylation by alanine decarboxylase (CsAlaDC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Takeo, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Indeed, CsAlaDC expression level and catalytic activity largely determine the theanine accumulation level in tea plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>). As a novel gene, <italic>CsAlaDC</italic> had not been reported in other plant species before it was identified in tea plants. Previous studies indicated that <italic>AlaDC</italic> originated from the <italic>SerDC</italic> by gene duplication in tea plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bai et al., 2021</xref>). However, despite sharing highly conserved amino acid sequences, CsAlaDC and CsSerDC specifically catalyze the decarboxylation of alanine and serine, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). In addition, CsAlaDC exhibited a much lower enzymatic activity compared with CsSerDC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bai et al., 2021</xref>). However, the structural basis and key amino acids underlying the evolution of the substrate specificity and enzymatic activity of CsAlaDC are unknown.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Metabolic pathways and sequence analysis of <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic> alanine decarboxylase (CsAlaDC) and SerDCs in plants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The decarboxylation of serine and alanine in plants.

Here, we obtained the X-ray crystal structure of CsAlaDC and AtSerDC. According to the crystal structure, we found a distinctive zinc finger structure located at both CsAlaDC and AtSerDC, which has not been identified in any other Group II PLP-dependent amino acid decarboxylases that have been previously characterized. By comparing the substrate binding pockets, we identified Phe<sup>106</sup> of CsAlaDC and Tyr<sup>111</sup> of AtSerDC as the crucial sites for substrate specificity. By conducting mutation screening based on the protein structures, we identified the amino acids repressing the catalytic activity and discovered that CsAlaDC<sup>L110F/P114A</sup> exhibited a 2.3-fold increase in catalytic activity compared to that of CsAlaDC and enhanced the engineering of theanine production <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Enzymatic properties of CsAlaDC, AtSerDC, and CsSerDC</title><p>CsAlaDC originates from CsSerDC by gene duplication and neofunctionalization in tea plants, but they catalyze different metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

The results showed that CsAlaDC can effectively catalyze the decarboxylation of alanine to generate EA, whereas its catalytic efficacy towards serine was relatively inferior. Conversely, AtSerDC and CsSerDC selectively catalyzed serine decarboxylation to yield ethanolamine but did not exhibit activity towards alanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These findings confirmed that CsAlaDC and SerDCs do not have promiscuous decarboxylase activity on Ala and Ser.</p><p>The kinetic properties of CsAlaDC, AtSerDC, and CsSerDC were determined through the use of corresponding substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and the results are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. The kinetic parameter <italic>Km</italic> of CsAlaDC was determined to be 1.215 mM, which is similar to that of AtSerDC and CsSerDC at 1.912 mM and 2.364 mM, respectively. However, AtSerDC has a <italic>Vmax</italic> of 7.787 μmo L<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>, which is 4.6-fold that of CsAlaDC’s <italic>Vmax</italic> of 1.709 μmo L<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>; while CsSerDC has a <italic>Vmax</italic> of 9.031 μmo L<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>, which is 5.3-fold that of CsAlaDC. The findings suggest that the enzymatic catalytic efficiency of CsSerDC and AtSerDC is approximately triple compared to that of CsAlaDC, and the <italic>Vmax</italic> of CsAlaDC is considerably lower than that of both CsSerDC and AtSerDC. The observed disparity in <italic>Vmax</italic> suggests that CsAlaDC and SerDCs may exhibit discrepancies in substrate-to-product conversion rates under saturated substrate conditions.

The monomer of CsAlaDC or AtSerDC is divided into three distinct structural domains: an N-terminal domain (N-terminal –104 aa in CsAlaDC, N-terminal –109 aa in AtSerDC), a large domain (105–364 aa in CsAlaDC, 110–369 aa in AtSerDC), and a small C-terminal domain (365 aa-C-terminus in CsAlaDC, 370-C-terminus as in AtSerDC), colored light pink, khaki, and sky blue, respectively. Compared to the full-length protein, the N-terminal structures of CsAlaDC and AtSerDC were truncated by 60 and 65 amino acid residues, respectively. The N-terminal domain of the truncated protein contains a long α-helix, which is connected to the large domain through a long loop. The helix of one subunit is antiparallel to the corresponding helix in the neighboring subunit, forming a clamp. Therefore, the N-terminal domain may not be an independent folding unit and is likely only stable in dimers. The large domain contains a seven-stranded mixed β-sheet surrounded by eight α-helices, while the C-terminal domain is composed of a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and three α-helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The catalytic site of the enzyme is positioned within a superficial crevice at the junction of two subunits forming a dimeric arrangement. The amino acid residues derived from both subunits participate in the binding of the PLP, effectively anchoring it to the active site.

Importantly, this particular configuration is exclusive to the two proteins under examination and has not been identified in any other Group II PLP-dependent amino acid decarboxylases that have been previously characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Komori et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The crystal structures of the CsAlaDC-EA complex and AtSerDC were obtained and further analyzed. In the former complex, PLP bound to Lys<sup>309</sup> via a Schiff base linkage (internal aldimine form), and the pyridine moiety of PLP is positioned between the imidazole ring of His<sup>196</sup> and the methyl group of Ala<sup>279</sup> in a parallel orientation to the imidazole ring. The carboxylic group of Asp<sup>277</sup> stabilizes the N1 of PLP by a salt bridge interaction, providing the latter with the strong electrophilicity necessary to stabilize carbon ion intermediates during enzymatic catalysis. The O3 forms hydrogen bonds with Thr<sup>247</sup> and Lys<sup>309</sup>. Additionally, His<sup>308</sup>, Gly<sup>169</sup>, Thr<sup>170</sup>, Lys<sup>309</sup>, and Ser<sup>347</sup>*(‘*’ denotes the amino acids on adjacent subunits) establish a hydrogen bonding network with the phosphate group of PLP, consequently fortifying its attachment to the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Similarly, in the latter structure, the pyridine ring of PLP was sandwiched between the imidazole ring of His<sup>201</sup> and the methyl group of Ala<sup>284</sup>.

A flexible loop of amino acids originating from one monomer extends into the active site of the other monomer and plays a crucial role in catalysis. The catalytic loop in AtSerDC, consisting of amino acid residues 328–341, is well-structured and exhibits clear electron density. However, the corresponding loop in CsAlaDC is disordered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). The aforementioned loop harbors a conserved Tyr residue that is believed to function as a proton donor of the carbanion in the catalytic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Torrens-Spence et al., 2020</xref>). In particular, CsAlaDC Tyr<sup>336</sup> and AtSerDC Tyr<sup>341</sup> correspond to that Tyr residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Upon superimposing the active site residues of CsAlaDC apo and CsAlaDC-EA complex, it was observed that the hydroxyl group of Tyr<sup>336</sup>* in the CsAlaDC-EA complex exhibits a substantial 60 degree deviation along the Cα-Cβ bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).

Within this motif, the first two residues, Y (Tyrosine) and P (Proline) are completely conserved across all 563 proteins. However, the third residue where Tyr<sup>111</sup> in AtSerDC or Phe<sup>106</sup> in CsAlaDC is positioned exhibits variability among Y, T (Threonine), F (Phenylalanine), V (Valine), A (Alanine), I (Isoleucine), L (Leucine), or other amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

In light of this observation, we postulated a hypothesis: EA, generated via Ala decarboxylation by CsAlaDC, can be toxic and harmful to plants if accumulated excessively. Thus, during the evolution of plant serine decarboxylase into alanine decarboxylase, the enzyme has evolved not just to alter the substrate preference but also to reduce catalytic activity to control EA production within a suitable range. Based on this hypothesis, we suggest that mutating specific amino acids in CsAlaDC to those corresponding amino acids in SerDCs could enhance its activity, and the results could provide insights into the evolution of CsAlaDC enzymatic activity.</p><p>Dimerization is essential to AlaDC/SerDC activities because the active site is composed of residues from two monomers. To identify the amino acids repressing the enzymatic activity of CsAlaDC during evolution from SerDC, we analyzed the crystal structures and the amino acids at the dimer interface between CsAlaDC, and AtSerDC.

Therefore, we mutated these amino acids of CsAlaDC into those in the corresponding positions of AtSerDC and CsSerDC, and performed enzyme activity assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The results demonstrated that CsAlaDC<sup>L110F</sup> and CsAlaDC<sup>P114A</sup> exhibited significantly enhanced enzyme activity compared to the wild-type CsAlaDC, with a 2.1-fold and 1.59-fold increase, respectively.

These findings suggested a critical role of Leu<sup>110</sup> and Pro<sup>114</sup> of CsAlaDC in the evolution of enzymatic activity and provided a basis to improve CsAlaDC activity.

By conducting mutation screens, we discovered a CsAlaDC mutant protein (L110F/P114A) that exhibited a 2.3-fold higher catalytic activity compared to the wild-type protein.

The Dali search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Holm, 2022</xref>) revealed that AtSerDC and CsAlaDC share structural similarities with 7CIG (MetDC [<italic>Streptomyces sp</italic>. 590]), 7ERV (HisDC1 [<italic>Photobacterium phosphoreum</italic>]), 6KHO (TrpDC [<italic>Oryza sativa Japonica</italic> Group]), 4E1O (HisDC2 [<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>]), 6JY1 (AspDC [<italic>Methanocaldococcus jannaschii</italic>]), and 5GP4 (GluDC [<italic>Levilactobacillus brevis</italic>]). The monomers of these amino acid decarboxylases all consist of three characteristic domains: the C-terminal domain, the large domain, and the N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). The amino acid residues that bind to PLP cofactors are conserved across multiple enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Out of the eight proteins analyzed, a total of thirteen amino acid residues were found to be conserved across all sequences (Glu<sup>143</sup>, Glu<sup>171</sup>, Lys<sup>201</sup>, Gly<sup>245</sup>, Thr<sup>247</sup>, Asp<sup>253</sup>, His<sup>275</sup>, Asp<sup>277</sup>, Ala<sup>279</sup>, Pro<sup>286</sup>, Ser<sup>302</sup>, Lys<sup>309</sup>, and Tyr<sup>336</sup> in CsAlaDC). Some of them are situated within the active center and play a role in stabilizing PLP or facilitating catalytic reactions. Conversely, other residues reside outside the active center and their function remains unclear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Group II PLP-dependent amino acid decarboxylases are characterized by the existence of a highly flexible loop, which is of great significance for the catalytic mechanism of decarboxylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Okawa et al., 2021</xref>). The loops are located at the dimer interface and extend to the active sites of other monomers in a closed conformation. Prior research has established that the conserved amino acid residue Tyr within the loop plays a crucial role in catalysis by donating protons to carbanions of quinone intermediates that arise following decarboxylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fenalti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chellam Gayathri and Manoj, 2019</xref>). Our experiments demonstrate that the substitution of the corresponding Tyr with Phe in the loop renders the protein inactive. Through the application of circular dichroism, we have corroborated that the stability of the protein is not compromised by mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A, B, D, E</xref>). Both the mutant and wild-type proteins manifest absorption bands at the 420 nm wavelength, signifying the formation of a Schiff base between PLP and the lysine residues found at the active site. Given that PLP has been incorporated during the protein purification stage, the absorbance observed for both the mutant and wild-type proteins at 420 nm is consistent when compared at equivalent concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). This corroboration implies that the protein mutation does not interfere with the binding to PLP. Consequently, the inactivation observed in the mutant proteins is not a consequence of instability incited by corresponding mutations, nor changes in the binding affinity between the protein and PLP induced by these mutations.</p><p>We observed that the substitution of Phe<sup>106</sup> for Tyr in CsAlaDC rendered CsAlaDC inactive, while the substitution of Tyr<sup>111</sup> for Phe in AtSerDC enabled alanine decarboxylase activity, and the alteration in the activity of the mutant protein bears no correlation to protein stability and affinity for PLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A, C, D, F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>), suggesting that the amino acid in the position is critical for determining substrate specificity. Integrative crystallographic structure of the two enzymes, we speculate the hydrophilic nature of the Lys residue in AtSerDC predisposes the active site to preferentially accommodate the hydrophilic amino acid Ser as its substrate. In contrast, the equivalent position in CsAlaDC is occupied by Phe, an amino acid lacking the hydroxyl group. This substitution enhances the hydrophobic nature of the substrate-binding pocket. Consequently, CsAlaDC demonstrates a unique predilection, selectively binding Ala (an amino acid with comparatively hydrophobic properties) as its preferred substrate.</p><p>The monomeric configuration of CsAlaDC and AtSerDC is akin to that of other Group II PLP-dependent amino acid decarboxylases, except for a conspicuous dissimilarity. Unlike other Group II PLP-dependent amino acid decarboxylases, the C-terminal of CsAlaDC and AtSerDC harbors an evident zinc finger structure. We propose that this structure could potentially influence enzyme stability. To test this hypothesis, we truncated the zinc finger structure from both proteins and expressed them. Our findings indicate that, following the excision of the zinc finger structure, CsAlaDC became insoluble, while AtSerDC displayed a similar trait to a certain extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Hence, we can establish that the zinc finger structure indeed exerts an influence on the enzyme’s stability. The potential for additional functions necessitates further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Evolution of AlaDC and SerDC</title><p>The structure of CsAlaDC seems like with AtSerDC, however, there are differences in substrate specificity. To clarify the relationship between CsAlaDC and other SerDCs, we analyzed serine decarboxylase-like proteins in Embryophyta that are highly homologous to CsAlaDC and constructed phylogenetic trees to gain insight into their evolutionary relationships (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Based on our experimental findings and evolutionary evidence, we have identified a conserved YPX motif at the substrate binding pocket. For most plants, the residue X in this motif is predominantly Tyr, which corresponds to the serine decarboxylase protein. However, other residues such as Thr, Phe, Val, Ala, and Ile can also occupy this position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). Interestingly, serine decarboxylase-like proteins containing YPF motifs, which have the potential to function as alanine decarboxylases, were found to be distributed throughout the phylogenetic tree, including Asteroideae, Ericales, Chenopodiaceae, Poaceae, and Ranunculales (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, these proteins were absent in some more recent species. This observation implies that the emergence of alanine decarboxylase in these particular species could be attributed to convergent evolution.</p><p>Moreover, we have observed the enrichment of serine decarboxylase-like proteins that possess a YPT motif within the Fabales (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Prior research has demonstrated that XP_004496485–1, which possesses a YPT motif, displays catalytic efficacy toward the processes of decarboxylation and oxidative deamination of Phe, Met, Leu, and Trp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Torrens-Spence et al., 2014</xref>). Given that the YPT motif is highly conserved and widely distributed in Fabales, serine decarboxylase-like proteins bearing the YPT motif may have developed a unique substrate specificity in Fabales, beyond their conventional decarboxylation functions, as exemplified by XP_004496485–1 protein mentioned above. We speculate that these proteins may be capable of catalyzing other reactions, potentially involving non-protein amino acids or other substances as substrates.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Applied to improve the synthesis of theanine</title><p>Theanine is an important indicator of green tea quality.

The engineered CsAlaDC mutant (L110F/P114A) not only displayed enhanced catalytic efficiency but also substantially improved L-theanine yield in a synthetic biosynthesis setup with PsGS or MmGMAS. Our research expanded the repertoire of potential alanine decarboxylases through the discovery of 13 homologous enzyme candidates across embryophytic species and uncovered a special motif present in serine protease-like proteins within Fabale, suggesting a potential divergence in substrate specificity and catalytic functions. These insights lay the groundwork for the development of industrial biocatalytic processes, promising to elevate the production of L-theanine and support innovation within the tea industry.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plants materials</title><p>Tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>) plants were grown in a controlled chamber, under a 16 hr light and 8 hr dark photoperiod at 25℃.

In comparison to the standard curve of molecular weight provided by the authors, it appears that these proteins are at least homo-tetramers, which contradicts the description in the text. This should be re-evaluated and clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your careful reading of the manuscript and valuable suggestions. We have included the SEC elution profile in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and added descriptions of the oligomeric states of proteins in the revised manuscript. CsSerDC was eluted at 65.38 mL, corresponding to a molecular weight of 292 kDa, which is five times the monomeric protein (54.7 kDa). However, due to the absence of CsSerDC crystal structure, it remains uncertain whether the protein forms a pentamer. AtSerDC was eluted at 72.25 mL, with a corresponding molecular weight of 155 kDa, which is 3.3 times the monomer (47.3 kDa). CsAlaDC was eluted at 74.37 mL, with a corresponding molecular weight of 127 kDa, which is 2.7 times the monomer (47.3 kDa). The elution profiles suggest that AtSerDC and CsAlaDC potentially exist in homotrimeric form. This observation stands in contradiction to our subsequent findings where the protein manifests in a dimeric structure. A plausible explanation could be the non-ideal spherical shape of the protein. Under such circumstances, the hydrodynamic radius of the protein could supersede its actual size, potentially leading to an overestimation of the molecular weight on the size-exclusion chromatography [ref].</p><p>References:</p><p>Burgess, R.

For CsAlaDC, the calculated Kcat/Km is 56.0 s-1 M-1. Therefore, the catalytic efficiency of CsSerDC and AtSerDC is approximately three times that of CsAlaDC.
