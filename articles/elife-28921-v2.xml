pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28921.001</object-id><p>Most phenotypes are determined by molecular systems composed of specifically interacting molecules. However, unlike for individual components, little is known about the distributions of mutational effects of molecular systems as a whole. We ask how the distribution of mutational effects of a transcriptional regulatory system differs from the distributions of its components, by first independently, and then simultaneously, mutating a transcription factor and the associated promoter it represses. We find that the system distribution exhibits increased phenotypic variation compared to individual component distributions - an effect arising from intermolecular epistasis between the transcription factor and its DNA-binding site. In large part, this epistasis can be qualitatively attributed to the structure of the transcriptional regulatory system and could therefore be a common feature in prokaryotes. Counter-intuitively, intermolecular epistasis can alleviate the constraints of individual components, thereby increasing phenotypic variation that selection could act on and facilitating adaptive evolution.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>distributions of mutational effects</kwd><kwd>epistasis</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>291734</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lagator</surname><given-names>Mato</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>648440</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bollback</surname><given-names>Jonathan P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Greater phenotypic variation is exposed by mutations in a gene regulatory system compared to mutations in its constitutive components, namely the transcription factor and the promoter, alone.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Distributions of mutational effects (DMEs) and the nature of the interactions among mutations (epistasis) critically determine evolutionary paths and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eyre-Walker and Keightley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Visser and Krug, 2014</xref>). DMEs are central to a range of fundamental questions in evolutionary biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Halligan and Keightley, 2009</xref>), including understanding the origins of novel traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Soskine and Tawfik, 2010</xref>), evolution of sex and recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Otto and Lenormand, 2002</xref>), and maintenance of genetic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Charlesworth et al., 1995</xref>). In contrast to selective constraints, which act on the variation already present in a population, biophysical laws and molecular mechanisms that define how a molecular system functions constrain the access to phenotypic variation through mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Camps et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wagner, 2011</xref>), and in doing so determine the shape of the DME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fontana and Buss, 1994</xref>).</p><p>Even though most phenotypes are determined by underlying molecular systems that consist of multiple specifically interacting molecular components, direct and systematic experimental estimates of DMEs have been limited to the two extremes only: either at the level of the whole organism, obtained in mutation accumulation studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Halligan and Keightley, 2009</xref>); or at the level of individual components, such as proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bershtein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sarkisyan et al., 2016</xref>) and DNA-binding sites for transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kinney et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shultzaberger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Metzger et al., 2015</xref>), determined through direct mutagenesis. Knowing only the effects of mutations in individual molecular components might be insufficient to understand how the whole system evolves, as recent studies focusing on the interaction of mutations in two components of a molecular system uncovered the existence of pervasive intermolecular epistasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Podgornaia and Laub, 2015</xref>). Because of the large mutational space of proteins, these studies focused only on mutations in specific residues that lie at the interface between the two interacting molecules. In contrast, addressing the more general question of how intermolecular epistasis shapes DMEs of molecular systems is only possible by experimentally tackling the nearly prohibitive space of possible mutational combinations, which even for single components is conceivable only in rare cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sarkisyan et al., 2016</xref>). Here, by using one of the best understood transcriptional regulation systems, we experimentally ask how the DME of a system differs from the DMEs of its constitutive components.</p><p>To address this question, we used a simple gene regulatory system based on the canonical Lambda bacteriophage switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ptashne, 2011</xref>), consisting of three components – the σ<sup>70</sup>RNA polymerase complex (together, we refer to them as RNAP), transcription factor CI (<italic>trans</italic>-element), and the <italic>P<sub>R</sub> cis</italic>-element that contains the overlapping DNA-binding sites of the two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These three molecular components interact to produce a quantitative phenotype: gene expression. Specifically, we used a genetic system in which a strong promoter <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> controls the expression of a yellow fluorescence protein (<italic>yfp</italic>) and is repressed by the CI repressor, which we placed under the inducible promoter <italic>P<sub>TET</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). This system exhibits high <italic>yfp</italic> expression in the absence of CI, where the level of expression is determined solely by RNAP binding. However, in the presence of CI, achieved by the induction of the <italic>P<sub>TET</sub></italic> promoter, the system is strongly repressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We find that, even in such a simple transcriptional regulatory system, the DME of the system differs unexpectedly from the individual component DMEs, and that most of this difference can be directly attributed to the genetic regulatory structure of the system.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28921.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Genetic organization of the Lambda phage switch and the experimental system.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The Lambda phage switch consists of two transcription factors - CI and Cro; two promoters - a strong promoter <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> and a weak promoter <italic>P<sub>RM</sub></italic> (not shown); and three operator sites - <italic>O<sub>R1</sub></italic>, <italic>O<sub>R2</sub></italic>, and <italic>O<sub>R3</sub></italic>.

The distributions of fluorescence are shown in the absence of CI (red) and in the presence of CI (blue). Each distribution was obtained by measuring fluorescence of two independent measurements of 500,000 cells by flow cytometry, which were then pooled together. The dashed lines separate three categories of phenotypes – ‘no expression’ phenotypes (corresponding to repressed wildtype); ‘high expression’ phenotypes (corresponding to the wildtype in the absence of CI); and ‘intermediate’ phenotypes. No expression and high expression categories are defined to include &gt;99.9% of the wildtype fluorescence distribution in the presence and in the absence of CI, respectively. The Shannon entropy (S) is used to estimate how uniform each distribution is across the entire range of possible expression levels. The associated standard deviation (±) is given for each <italic>S</italic> value. Blue numbers are percentage of counts in each category in the presence of CI. Numbers in parentheses are percentage of counts excluding the estimated percentages of uniquely transformed individuals carrying the wildtype genotype (see Materials and methods). The naïve additive convolution prediction for each system library and the associated predictions for the frequency of mutants in each category are shown in grey. Pearson’s Chi-squared test was used to assess the difference between the observed and the convolution-predicted frequency of mutants in each category (low: χ<sup>2</sup><sub>(2)</sub>=8.20; p&lt;0.05; intermediate: χ<sup>2</sup><sub>(2)</sub>=32.26; p&lt;0.0001; and high mutation frequency library: χ<sup>2</sup><sub>(2)</sub>=74.51; p&lt;0.0001).

For each component, we created libraries with approximately 0.01, 0.04, and 0.07 mutations per nucleotide (low, intermediate, and high mutation probability libraries, respectively). Due to the different sizes of the two components (84 bp for <italic>cis</italic> and 714 bp for <italic>trans</italic>), mutants in cis-element libraries contained on average 1, 3, and 6 mutations, whereas mutants in trans-element libraries contained on average 7, 28, and 49 mutations, respectively. We did not mutate the σ<sup>70</sup> – RNAP complex due to its cell-wide pleiotropic effects. For assessing the DMEs of the system, we created three additional ‘system mutant libraries’ by combining <italic>cis-</italic> and <italic>trans-</italic>element mutant libraries of the same mutation probability. Each library consisted of more than 30,000 uniquely transformed individuals, and we estimated the corresponding DME for each library by measuring fluorescence, that is gene expression, of 1 million randomly sampled individuals by flow cytometry. We quantified the differences in DMEs in two ways. First, by observing the frequency of mutants in three biologically meaningful categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>): (i) mutants that are indistinguishable from the wildtype without the CI repressor (‘high expression phenotypes’); (ii) mutants indistinguishable from the wildtype with CI (‘no expression phenotypes’); and, importantly for our argument, (iii) mutants with expression levels that the wildtype cannot achieve (‘intermediate expression phenotypes’). Second, by calculating the Shannon entropy, which quantifies how uniformly the mutants cover the entire range of possible gene expression phenotypes.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>DMEs of the <italic>cis</italic>- and the <italic>trans</italic>-element are categorically different</title><p>The difference between the effects of mutations in the <italic>cis</italic>- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C,D</xref>) and the <italic>trans-</italic>element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F,G</xref>) is unambiguous. Most <italic>cis</italic>-element mutants, in the presence of CI, have low expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C,D</xref>). Such low expression can result either from sufficient CI repressor binding and/or impaired RNAP binding. The frequency of mutants with an intermediate expression phenotype in the presence of CI increases with the average number of mutations, a pattern that is also observed in cis<italic>-</italic>element libraries in the absence of CI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C,D</xref>). In contrast, the effects of mutations in the <italic>trans</italic>-element have a distinctive bimodal distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F,G</xref>). The two peaks in the distribution correspond to the expression levels of the wildtype population in the absence and presence of CI, revealing that the majority of CI mutants are either fully or close to fully functional, or completely inactive on the wildtype <italic>cis</italic> background. Furthermore, increasing the average number of mutations in the <italic>trans</italic>-element decreases the frequency of intermediate expression phenotypes. As the shape of the DME is determined by the underlying biophysical and mechanistic constraints that limit the phenotypic variation accessible through mutation, we conclude that the <italic>cis</italic>- and the <italic>trans</italic>-element have categorically different constraints. This categorical difference is best observed in a direct comparison between high mutation <italic>cis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and low mutation <italic>trans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) libraries, which have approximately the same average number of mutations.</p><p>In order to further demonstrate that this categorical difference is not an artifact of the different number of mutations introduced into each element, we show that the same general trend is evident when comparing the effects of 150 random single point mutations of known identity in each, the <italic>cis</italic>- and the <italic>trans</italic>-element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). These measurements were done at the population level, in a plate reader. Point mutations in the <italic>cis</italic>-element, when only their effect on RNAP binding is measured, show a high frequency of intermediate expression levels. This is in agreement with other studies of prokaryotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kinney et al., 2010</xref>) and eukaryotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shultzaberger et al., 2012</xref>) DNA-binding sites.

This pattern can also be observed in the library of 150 random system double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), which consist of a unique combination of the previously described point mutations in cis and in trans (comparing system to <italic>cis</italic>: D<sub>KS</sub> = 0.39, p&lt;0.0001; system to <italic>trans</italic>: D<sub>KS</sub> = 0.66, p&lt;0.0001). Furthermore, the frequency of intermediate phenotypes increased with the average number of mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

Since we use log<sub>10</sub> of expression as our phenotype of interest, we calculate epistasis between mutations in the two components of the system (what we call intermolecular epistasis) as the deviation from the additive prediction based on single component effects. The additive null prediction for interactions between mutations, when considering only three possible categories of mutational effects (‘no’, ‘intermediate’, and ‘high expression’), is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.

We find that ‘naïve’ convolution predictions, which are carried out in the absence of any knowledge of the genetic regulatory structure of the system, are significantly different from the observed system distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I,J</xref>), suggesting the existence of intermolecular epistasis between the two components.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28921.015</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Additive null predictions for interactions between mutations.</title><p>Most interactions result in high expression phenotypes because the wildtype in the presence of CI has no expression, meaning that mutations are either neutral or increase wildtype expression.

From these measurements, we calculated epistasis as the deviation from the additive expectation based on wildtype-normalized single mutant effects. This definition of epistasis mirrors the convolution approach utilized for the analysis of DMEs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>Intermolecular epistasis was common between single point mutations in our system, as 71 of 150 double mutants significantly deviated from their additive expectations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). As such, intermolecular epistasis impacts expression levels in the system not only when a relatively large number of mutations accumulate, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, but also when a single point mutation is introduced in each of the components. Furthermore, 53 of these 71 mutants were in positive epistasis, meaning that the double mutant effect was higher than expected based on single mutant effects. Such positive epistasis contributes to the observed increase in the frequency of mutants with intermediate phenotypes in the system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), as seemingly neutral <italic>trans</italic> mutations, which fully repress the wildtype <italic>cis</italic>, show elevated expression on mutated <italic>cis</italic> backgrounds. On the other hand, the presence of negative epistasis indicates a penetrant <italic>trans</italic> mutation, whose high expression on the wildtype <italic>cis</italic> is decreased on a mutated <italic>cis</italic> background.

We wanted to understand if these predictions could be improved by accounting for the effects of <italic>cis-</italic>element mutations on RNAP binding, which are measured in the absence of CI.

Here, we show how those deviations emerge from the underlying genetic regulatory structure, and hence how they might lead to better predictions of regulatory system DMEs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Accounting for the genetic regulatory structure of the system does not explain all intermolecular epistasis</title><p>While considering the effects of <italic>cis</italic>-element mutations on RNAP binding explains intermolecular epistasis to an extent that allows more accurate predictions of system DMEs, it might not explain all of it. To determine the extent to which intermolecular epistasis cannot be explained by accounting for the genetic regulatory structure of the system, we constructed a second library of 150 system double mutants. This time, instead of randomly combining point mutations in <italic>cis-</italic> and <italic>trans</italic>-elements, we combined point mutations with a specific phenotype. Namely, all <italic>cis</italic>-element point mutants exhibited high expression in the absence of CI, meaning that the binding of RNAP was not measurably impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). All point mutations in trans used to assemble the 150 double mutants exhibited no expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), meaning that these mutants had a fully functional <italic>trans</italic>-element on the wildtype <italic>cis</italic> background. The system double mutant library made in this manner corresponds to the partition combination shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>. In such a library, in the presence of CI, the additive null model predicts that a double mutant would exhibit the same phenotype as its <italic>cis</italic> point mutant, when the corresponding <italic>trans</italic> mutant maintains the same binding properties as the wildtype CI. When this is true, the system double mutant would not be in significant epistasis. Conversely, the system double mutant in this library would be in significant epistasis only when the <italic>trans</italic> mutant binds the mutated <italic>cis</italic> differently than the wildtype <italic>trans</italic> does.</p><p>We found that 15 double mutants in this library are in significant epistasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These mutants maintained a decreased yet substantial dynamical range between the two environments (absence and presence of CI), and hence were still functional regulators (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). Furthermore, all 15 were in positive epistasis, indicating that the double mutant effect is greater than the additive expectation. In such mutants, <italic>trans</italic> mutations are phenotypically neutral on the wildtype <italic>cis</italic>, but not on a mutated <italic>cis</italic> background, meaning that the <italic>trans</italic> mutant binds the mutated <italic>cis</italic> less strongly than the wildtype CI does. It is worth noting that the lack of mutants that are in negative epistasis in this library might be due to the strong wildtype binding of the CI repressor, so that introducing point mutations in trans that improve binding is highly unlikely. When mutations in trans induce alterations to the binding properties of the repressor (but not complete loss of function), intermolecular epistasis cannot be accounted for by the underlying structure of the genetic regulatory network. Interestingly, a disproportionate number of double mutants that were in positive epistasis carried a <italic>trans</italic> mutation in the linker region of the CI (χ<sup>2</sup><sub>(4)</sub>=20.66; p&lt;0.0005), which connects the N-terminal DNA-binding domain with the C-terminal dimerization domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata2">Figure 6—source data 2</xref>).

We focused on the phenotypic effects, rather than the fitness effects of mutations, in order to minimize the complexity of the studied system and also to enable a more direct interpretation of the results, as fitness effects of mutations depend on a much larger, and often unknown, set of factors than simply their phenotypic effects. Doing so enables an interpretation of observed DMEs in the light of their underlying molecular mechanisms, as recently shown for a prokaryotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lagator et al., 2017</xref>) and a eukaryotic <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">White et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, while previous studies investigated the effects of specific mutations in the contact surface between two molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Podgornaia and Laub, 2015</xref>), their local nature, imposed by the large mutational space of proteins, prevented conclusions about DMEs of molecular systems. Precisely because our experimental approach allowed us to overcome these obstacles, we were able to show how the regulatory network structure determines intermolecular epistasis, indicating a broad range of conditions under which the additive null models of interactions between mutations might be inaccurate.</p><p>The observed increase in the frequency of intermediate phenotypes arises, in large part, from intermolecular epistasis between the two components of the system, most of which can be attributed to the structure of the gene regulatory system. The observed increase is due to both positive and negative epistasis. When intermolecular epistasis is positive, mutations in <italic>cis</italic> expose the genetic variation hidden in originally phenotypically neutral <italic>trans</italic> mutations. This can be achieved in two ways: (i) through changes in the RNAP and repressor binding sites, which are accounted for by considering the genetic regulatory structure of the system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>); or (ii) when mutations in trans change the binding preference of the repressor, so that a mutation in <italic>cis</italic> decreases the binding of the mutated <italic>trans</italic> more than it decreases the binding of the wildtype repressor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Negative intermolecular epistasis, on the other hand, arises when: (i) the <italic>trans</italic> mutations are penetrant, so that their effects (in particular, increased expression) are buffered by mutations in <italic>cis</italic>. This epistasis is frequently observed when <italic>trans</italic> mutations lead to a complete loss of binding (high expression phenotype), so that the system phenotype becomes the same in the presence and in the absence of CI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In other words, the system undergoes a qualitative transition from a three-component and thus a regulated promoter, to a two-component or a constitutive promoter. Under these conditions, the system phenotype is determined only by the effect of <italic>cis</italic> mutations on RNAP binding and can be thus explained by considering the genetic regulatory structure of the system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). (ii) Negative epistasis can also arise when <italic>trans</italic>-element mutations alter the binding preference of the repressor, so that the mutated <italic>trans</italic> binds mutated <italic>cis</italic> more strongly than the wildtype repressor does. We found no evidence for this type of epistasis in the library of 150 random double mutants, likely due to our use of the Lambda <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> promoter, which binds the repressor very tightly.</p><p>In the studied system, we demonstrate that intermolecular epistasis is present even between single point mutations in the <italic>cis-</italic> and the <italic>trans</italic>-element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and not only when a larger number of mutations accumulates in each component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). When considering interactions between point mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>;6), we identified that positive epistasis contributes disproportionately to the increase in the frequency of intermediate phenotypes. The extent to which positive, as opposed to negative, epistasis drives the observed increase in the intermediate phenotypes when a greater number of mutations are present in the components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) cannot be addressed without knowing the effects of specific molecular interactions between a prohibitively large number of mutation combinations.</p><p>Epistasis has been shown to impose constraints on evolutionary paths by increasing the ruggedness of the adaptive landscape both in theoretical and experimental studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Whitlock et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barton and Partridge, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Weinreich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Poelwijk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Breen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Podgornaia and Laub, 2015</xref>). Our data suggest that, for transcriptional regulatory networks, mutating the system of specifically interacting components alleviates the biophysical and mechanistic constraints acting on individual components, and in doing so increases phenotypic variation accessible through mutation. This role of intermolecular epistasis as a facilitator rather than a constraint on evolution arises, in significant part, directly from the genetic structure of a repressible transcriptional regulatory system. As such, it might be a common feature in prokaryotes, where repression through direct binding site overlap with RNAP forms the most common type of transcriptional regulatory system organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Salgado et al., 2013</xref>). In these and other similar systems, potential paths for protein evolution might be more abundant when the interacting DNA-binding site is also mutating, as mutations in the partner component can expose the genetic variation hidden in originally phenotypically neutral mutations. Such intermolecular epistasis could give rise to punctuated protein evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fontana and Schuster, 1998</xref>) – long periods of phenotypic stasis during which a transcription factor accumulates neutral mutations, interrupted by rapid adaptive evolution facilitated by mutations in the DNA-binding site. Furthermore, a gene might be horizontally transferred with its cognate <italic>cis-</italic>element, but without its cognate regulator. Then, intermolecular epistasis between the transferred <italic>cis</italic>-element and the orthologous transcription factor may reveal previously unavailable phenotypes that can facilitate adaptation to new niches. Therefore, accumulating mutations in the entire system, as opposed to only in a single component, appears to facilitate evolution both by extending the neutral sequence space, and hence increasing diversity through drift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lynch and Hagner, 2015</xref>), as well as by increasing the available phenotypic variability.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Gene regulation in the lambda phage switch</title><p>The <italic>right</italic> regulatory region of Lambda phage (O<sub>R</sub>) is responsible for the decision-making between lysis or lysogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Johnson et al., 1981</xref>).

We created three mutant libraries with different average probability of mutations (0.01, 0.04, and 0.07 mutation chance per nucleotide) for both the transcription factor (714 bp) and the <italic>P<sub>R</sub> cis</italic>-regulatory element (84 bp). Therefore, the average number of mutations per mutant in the <italic>trans-</italic>element libraries was 7, 28, or 49, while in the <italic>cis-</italic>element it was 1, 3, or 6, respectively. We applied the same likelihood of mutation per nucleotide rather than using the same actual number of mutations between equivalent <italic>cis-</italic> and <italic>trans-</italic>element libraries in order to more accurately represent the biological process of mutagenesis.</p><p>PCR products of mutagenesis reactions were ligated into the wildtype construct, and inserted into One-Shot Top10 cells (Life Technologies, Carlsbad). This step was used to maximize the library diversity due to One-Shot Top10 cells’ high competency. Following electroporation, cells were plated at low concentrations on selective kanamycin plates to allow single colony formation and minimize resource competition, and grown overnight. Using chilled LB media, colonies were washed off the plates and collected. To ensure large coverage, we cloned mutagenized PCR products until we obtained at least 30,000 individual colonies (uniquely transformed individuals). Due to the stochastic nature of the mutagenesis protocol used (Agilent Technologies), the number of uniquely transformed individuals did not necessarily equal the number of different mutant genotypes, especially at low mutation rates. To illustrate, when the mutation rate was low so that a <italic>cis</italic>-element mutant would have on average only one mutation, some PCR mutagenesis products did not contain any mutations. When mutations were in the <italic>trans-</italic>element, which is ~10-fold longer, almost all PCR mutagenesis products contained several mutations. Using the information provided by the supplier (which we verified by sequencing 40 mutants from each <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> library, see below) on the distributions of the number of mutations (given a mutagenesis rate), we estimated that approximately 34.2%, 3.5%, and 0.2% of the low, intermediate, and high mutation number <italic>cis-</italic>element libraries consisted of wildtype genotypes. The comparative proportion of wildtype genotypes in the <italic>trans-</italic>element libraries was 0.07%, 10<sup>−13</sup>%, and 10<sup>−22</sup>%.</p><p>Populations containing a mixture of mutants with a given number of mutations were used to isolate plasmids, and clone them into the modified MG1655 strain expressing <italic>tetR</italic> gene from a constitutive <italic>PN<sub>25</sub></italic> promoter. We showed that the distributions of mutation numbers in 40 isolated individuals from each library conformed to the distributions of mutation numbers provided by the supplier. We did this by comparing the actual distribution of the number of mutations to the Poisson distribution based on the predicted mutation probability, using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>). We used a power test to determine that the sample size of 40 was sufficient to verify the predicted number of mutations, with power set at 0.80 and desired detectable difference of ±0.5 mutations. Among the 240 sequenced mutants from the six libraries (6 × 40), we found no bias toward a specific type of mutations (transitions vs. transversions), nor did we identify overrepresentation of any particular single point mutation or locus in this dataset. From the sequenced mutants, we could estimate the proportion of re-ligated wildtype plasmid, in which the mutated region was not inserted and instead the wildtype used as the cloning template re-ligated back (this is a common occurrence with any library created through standard restriction-digestion cloning techniques). By observing the frequency of wildtype genotypes in the sequenced <italic>trans</italic> libraries (which, due to the relatively large number of mutations should not contain any wildtype sequences), we estimate that &lt; 5% of each library is re-ligated with the wildtype insert (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>). As this is a relatively small frequency to estimate precisely from sequencing 120 clones (3 × 40 <italic>trans</italic> library sequences), we do not account for it when considering the proportion of wildtype cells in each library. More importantly, this bias should be the same for all libraries and is therefore unlikely to alter our comparative analyses. Finally, among the 240 sequenced plasmids, we did not observe any that contained neither the mutated nor the wildtype insert, as all sequenced plasmids had an insert from cloning.</p><p>To make the whole system libraries, we removed through restriction digestion the mutated <italic>cis</italic>-element from each <italic>cis</italic> library and cloned it into the plasmid library already containing <italic>trans-</italic>element mutants with the corresponding mutation probability. Note that system libraries created in this way would likely have somewhat reduced diversity compared to either <italic>cis</italic> or <italic>trans</italic> libraries, as stochastically some mutants present in the component libraries would not find their way into the combined system library. By our design, this potential reduction in diversity would be equally biased toward <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> mutants, and ought not to be inflated for one component compared to the other.</p><p>In this study, we set out to understand phenotypic effects of mutations and to connect the DMEs to the epistasis between the two components. To achieve this goal, we investigated the DMEs in random mutant libraries, therefore without knowing the identity of the specific mutants. We did not characterize individual mutants, as drawing conclusion about the effects of specific mutations would require an unachievable high number of mutants to be analyzed. This was because the relatively large number of mutations introduced, in particular in the <italic>trans</italic>-element where each individual in the low mutation probability library contained on average seven point mutations, meant that we covered a very large mutational space. As such, we would need to characterize an astronomical number of mutants to gain the statistical power necessary to discern the effects of individual mutations from the interactions between them. Marginal sampling of such a huge sequence space, which is the best we could achieve, would tell us nothing about how individual positions affect the overall DME.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Single-cell fluorescence measurements</title><p>In order to obtain the distributions of phenotypic effects of mutations in mutant libraries, we used flow cytometry/fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to analyze expression levels of a yellow fluorescence protein. For all libraries, we measured gene expression levels both in the absence and in the presence of the transcription factor CI, determined by absence or presence of the inducer aTc, respectively. Throughout, we use log<sub>10</sub> of expression level as our phenotype of interest. Mutant libraries, as well as the wildtype construct, were grown overnight in M9 minimal media supplemented by 1% casamino acids, 2% glucose, and 30 μg/ml kanamycin, and either without or with 8 ng/ml aTc. From this point, the investigator was blinded with respect to the identity of each processed library. Overnight populations were diluted 100 times, grown for 2 hr, diluted a further 10 times and their fluorescence measured in a BD FACSAria<sup>tm</sup> III cell sorter. Fluorescence of 500,000 cells was measured for each replicate of each library. Two independent replicates of each mutant library and the monoclonal wildtype population in each of the two growth conditions were measured in the manner described above. All flow cytometry data were subsequently analyzed in FlowJo version 10.0.8r1, and measurements with extreme FSC-A and SSC-A values were excluded from the analyses. The two replicate measurements of each library exhibited the same distributions of fluorescence phenotypes (tested by the K-S test) and were pooled together, to give a million counts for each library.</p><p>We verified that 1 million individual measurements, as well as the library diversity of at least 30,000 mutants, accurately described phenotypic distributions of possible mutations. To ensure that we are capturing a significant proportion of all possible phenotypic effects, we subsampled progressively smaller number of measurements (n = 500,000; n = 250,000; n = 100,000; n = 50,000) of <italic>cis-</italic> and <italic>trans-</italic>element mutant libraries, in each relevant environment (both absence and presence of CI for <italic>cis-</italic>element libraries, and only presence of CI for <italic>trans-</italic>element libraries). We quantified the difference between each subsampled dataset and the corresponding full dataset using a K-S test, and found that, by randomly subsampling each dataset 50 times, the distributions of phenotypes in subsamples were not statistically different from the distribution of the full dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata4">Figure 2—source data 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Calculating entropy of a DME</title><p>Shannon entropy was used as an estimate of how uniform the distribution is across the whole range of possible phenotypes.

Error associated with each entropy measurement was calculated using standard bootstrapping methods. We performed a nonparametric permutation test to assess if the differences in entropy are significant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Estimating gene expression noise from flow cytometry measurements</title><p>We randomly isolated 20 <italic>cis</italic>, 20 <italic>trans</italic>, and 20 system mutants, from each mutation probability library, giving rise to 180 isolates. Power analysis (power.anova.test function in R statistical package) indicated that 20 samples in each category were sufficient to detect differences in gene expression noise of 2%, at significance level of 0.05 and power greater than 0.9. In a flow cytometer, we measured gene expression levels in the presence of CI in 100,000 individual counts, for two replicates of each mutant isolate, as well as for the wildtype. First, using a K-S test, we confirmed that the two replicate distributions for each mutant were not significantly different. We combined the two replicate measurements, and then randomly sampled without replacement 5000 reads from this common pool ten times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">5</xref>). Gene expression noise for each such sub-sample of 5000 reads was estimated as the coefficient of variation, as done in other studies on gene expression noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Metzger et al., 2015</xref>). Note that the gene expression noise measured in this manner comes from two sources – the heterogeneity of gene expression between individual cells and the measurement error inherent in the flow cytometer. We assume that the measurement error is constant between all mutants, so that possible changes in the coefficient of variation would indicate a difference in the heterogeneity of gene expression between genetically identical individuals. Using ANOVA (aov function in R statistical software, version 3.4.1), we asked if there were differences in the noise of gene expression between the 60 mutants of the same mutation probability, as well as between all 180 tested mutants. We performed this test separately for the mutants that had no expression (that were fully contained in the ‘no expression’ category), and for all other mutants. These two groups were treated separately because the flow cytometry fluorescence measurement is not responding to the same intracellular environment when the cell is producing a fluorescence protein and when it is not. As such, estimates of gene expression noise in the two categorically different types of intercellular environments are not directly comparable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Note that the tests carried out across all three mutation probabilities, which included 95 mutants with no fluorescence and 85 mutants with fluorescence, found no differences in gene expression noise. The probability of mutants with significantly different noise existing in the library but not being detected at such sample sizes is less than 10<sup>−4</sup> (calculated using experimentally-observed within and between group variance and at power level of 0.9). For a library of 30,000 random mutants, this would mean that no more than 10 system mutants could have different gene expression noise. For such a small number of mutants to skew the observed system DMEs and lead to an increase in intermediate phenotypes would be possible only if they were strongly overrepresented in the library. This is unlikely the case, since all 180 isolated mutants had growth rates that were comparable to the wildtype, and hence increase in noise would have to be hugely beneficial on a very short time scale (around 10 generations).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Naïve convolution of component distributions as the null model for additivity between mutations</title><p>Let us consider the effects of mutations, <italic>m</italic><sub>cis</sub> and <italic>m</italic><sub>trans</sub>, in two components of a system. As our phenotype of interest is log<sub>10</sub> of fluorescence level, we assume that, if two mutations are independent, their effects are additive: <italic>m</italic><sub>expected</sub> = <italic>m</italic><sub>cis</sub> + <sub>mtrans</sub>. A deviation from this additive assumption is termed epistasis, so that: ε = <italic>m</italic><sub>observed</sub> me<italic>x</italic><sub>pected</sub>. Note that a deviation from an additive expectation in log is equivalent to a multiplicative prediction on the linear scale. When considering a library of mutants in two components, their effects are represented by corresponding DMEs, <italic>f</italic><sub>cis</sub>(<italic>m</italic>) and <italic>f</italic><sub>trans</sub>(<italic>m</italic>), where m is the ‘true’ effect of a random mutation on the wildtype, in the absence of experimental noise and measurement errors. If one could obtain ‘true’ DMEs for mutant libraries (in the absence of any type of noise or error), then the additive null expectation should follow a simple convolution of the two distributions: <italic>f</italic><sub>expected</sub> = <italic>f</italic><sub>cis</sub> * <italic>f</italic><sub>trans</sub>. Any deviation of the observed combined library DME (<italic>f</italic><sub>observed</sub>) from the <italic>f</italic><sub>expected</sub> is indicative of epistasis.</p><p>In a realistic setting, experimental noise and instrumental error prevent direct measurements of the ‘true’ underlying DME (<italic>f</italic>), so that any measured DME (<italic>F</italic>) incorporates all the errors with its ‘true’ DME <italic>f</italic>. This means that, if the experimental noise and instrumental error do not change between mutants and across the dynamical measurement range, as is the case for our data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref>), then the observed DME (<italic>F</italic>) of a mutant library is equivalent to a convolution between its ‘true’ underlying DME (<italic>f</italic>) and the measured wildtype distribution (<italic>F</italic><sub>wt</sub>): <italic>F</italic><bold> =</bold> <italic>f</italic> * <italic>F</italic><sub>wt</sub>. In other words, the ‘true’ DME (<italic>f</italic>) shows how mutations alter wildtype expression. It follows that the additive prediction for the combined library, in the absence of epistasis, is a convolution of three DMEs:</p><p><italic>F</italic><sup>+</sup><sub>expected</sub> = <italic>f</italic>+<sub>expected</sub> * <italic>F</italic><sup>+</sup><sub>wt</sub> = <italic>f</italic> <sup>+</sup><sub>cis</sub> * <italic>f</italic> <sup>+</sup><sub>trans</sub> * <italic>F</italic><sup>+</sup><sub>wt</sub></p><p>where <italic>f</italic> <sup>+</sup><sub>cis</sub> and <italic>f</italic> <sup>+</sup><sub>trans</sub> are the ‘true’ distributions of the <italic>cis-</italic> and the <italic>trans</italic>-element, respectively, and the superscript ‘+’ indicates the presence of CI. The same equality would of course hold true in the absence of CI, but the analysis is trivial, as then the <italic>trans</italic> library shows no difference to the corresponding wildtype <italic>F</italic><sup>--</sup><sub>wt</sub>, that is <italic>f</italic> <sup>--</sup><sub>trans</sub> is a unit element for the operation of convolution (delta-distribution). For simplicity, we will omit the subscript when discussing DMEs obtained in the presence of CI.</p><p>The additive prediction (multiplicative in log<sub>10</sub> of expression) can be rewritten in two equivalent forms:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p><italic>F</italic><sub>expected</sub> = <italic>F</italic><sub>cis</sub> * <italic>f</italic><sub>trans</sub></p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>F</italic><sub>expected</sub> = <italic>f</italic><sub>cis</sub> * <italic>F</italic><sub>trans</sub></p></list-item></list><p>To obtain either of the underlying ‘true’ DMEs, we would need to deconvolve the wildtype distribution from one of the measured component library DMEs. However, although well understood and well behaved analytically, (de)convolutions are known to be highly unstable when used on numerical datasets, like ours. Therefore, we would need at least one of the component distributions in their analytical form. Instead of fitting one of the measured DMEs to some analytical representation followed by a deconvolution, we decided to directly ‘reverse engineer’ one of the component DMEs. We chose the <italic>cis</italic> DME in the presence of CI, as the simpler of the two. Concretely, we searched for <italic>f<sub>cis</sub></italic>, such that its convolution with <italic>F</italic><sub>wt</sub> matches the observed <italic>F</italic><sub>cis</sub> as closely as possible. We assumed <italic>f<sub>cis</sub></italic> to be from the gamma-family, as a relatively wide family of curves often used to describe DMEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7A</xref>). We optimized three parameters of the <italic>f<sub>cis</sub></italic>: shape, scale, and location, to minimize the squared differences between the observed <italic>cis</italic>-element DME (<italic>F</italic><sub>cis</sub>) and <italic>f<sub>cis</sub></italic> * <italic>F</italic><sub>wt</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7B</xref>). Note that the ‘true’ <italic>cis</italic> DME indicates that effectively all mutations in <italic>cis</italic> are either neutral or they increase expression. Because of this, convolving the ‘true’ <italic>cis</italic> distribution with any other distribution results in an overall increased expression, independently of where the original distribution is centered. This is in line with the usual treatment of single mutant effects: if an effect of a mutation is positive, the additive model states that the effect remains positive (and the same), independently of the genetic background.</p><p>After we obtained the ‘true’ DME for <italic>cis</italic> (<italic>f</italic><sub>cis</sub>), we convolve it with the observed <italic>trans</italic> DME to produce a naïve null-model for the system DME in the absence of epistasis. Convolving without any adjustments results in a part of the predicted system DME that lies beyond the highest experimentally recorded fluorescence levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7C</xref>). Because we use one of the strongest known promoters, the Lambda <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic>, predictions that have higher expression than the wildtype are not biologically meaningful, as no combination of component mutations could experimentally result in such high expression levels. To reflect this maximal biologically obtainable limit to expression levels, we introduce a cutoff, effectively treating any mutant that would result in higher expression levels as having the wildtype expression. In practice, we (i) removed the high expression peak from the <italic>trans</italic> DME (as convolution with those mutants gives rise to higher expression levels), (ii) performed a convolution between the remainder of the <italic>trans</italic> DME and the <italic>f</italic><sub>cis</sub>, (iii) introduced a smooth cutoff at maximum expression levels to the convolved distribution, and (iv) added back the residual part of the high-expressing mutants. More specifically in the first step, we fitted the fraction <italic>α</italic> of the wildtype distribution in the absence of CI (<italic>F</italic><sup>--</sup><sub>wt</sub>) to minimize its (square) difference to the right-hand part of the high-expression <italic>trans</italic> peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7D,E</xref>). In this way, we obtained a smooth remainder to convolve with <italic>f</italic><sub>cis</sub>, which will produce biologically realistic values. In the end, we add back the distribution of the wildtype in the absence of CI (<italic>F</italic><sup>--</sup><sub>wt</sub>), so to obtain a properly normalized predicted distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7F</xref>). Because we impose this limit to the highest biologically obtainable expression level, convolving a hypothetical distribution consisting of predominantly high expression phenotypes with the ‘true’ <italic>cis</italic> distribution (<italic>f<sub>cis</sub></italic>) would result in only high expression phenotypes.</p><p>The prediction for the system DME obtained in this manner reflects only two assumptions: the additive assumption of no epistasis, and the limit to maximal attainable expression levels. As such, this naïve prediction explicitly disregards any information about the genetic regulatory structure of the system. For each mutation probability, we evaluate if the predicted DME is different from the experimentally observed DME by conducting Pearson’s Chi-squared test to compare the frequencies of mutants in the three expression categories (‘no’, ‘intermediate’, and ‘high’ expression).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Epistasis between random point mutants</title><p>We created 150 mutants with a random point mutation in <italic>cis</italic>, and 150 mutants with a random point mutation in trans. <italic>Cis-</italic>element mutants were identified by Sanger sequencing of 400 randomly selected mutants from the <italic>cis-</italic>element library with low (0.01) mutation probability. To obtain 150 <italic>trans</italic>-element mutants, we repeated the random mutagenesis protocol on <italic>cI</italic> with a very low mutation rate (yielding approximately one mutation per kb). From this reaction, we randomly selected and sequenced 500 mutants in order to identify 150 that contained only a single point mutation. Then, we created a library of 150 double mutants, with one point mutation in the <italic>cis-</italic> and the other in the <italic>trans</italic>-element. These 150 double mutants were unique, as each one consisted of a unique pairing between <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> point mutations, so that no point mutations were found in more than one double mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>In a plate reader, we measured fluorescence levels of all 150 double mutants as well as of their corresponding point mutants.

The overnight populations were diluted 1000-fold, grown until OD<sub>600</sub> of approximately 0.05, and their fluorescence measured in a Bio-Tek Synergy H1 platereader. This procedure was replicated six times for each mutant. We performed a series of pairwise t-tests in order to determine which isolates had significantly different fluorescence to the wildtype. Using a K-S test, we compared if the system double mutants had a higher frequency of intermediate phenotypes.</p><p>Consistent with convolution-based analyses, we consider expression level as the log<sub>10</sub> of fluorescence, so that epistasis is defined as a deviation from an additive model, as <bold>ε =</bold> <italic>m</italic><sub>system</sub> - (<italic>m</italic><sub>cis</sub> +<italic>m</italic><sub>trans</sub>), where <italic>m</italic><sub>system</sub> is the wildtype-relative fluorescence of a system double mutant, and <italic>m</italic><sub>cis</sub> and <italic>m</italic><sub>trans</sub> the wildtype-relative fluorescence of the two corresponding single mutants. Epistasis was calculated in the presence of CI, as in the absence of CI all <italic>trans</italic> mutants exhibited wildtype expression, and all system double mutants had the same expression as the <italic>cis</italic> mutant alone. In order to statistically determine which double mutants exhibited epistasis (i.e. ε not equal 1), we conducted a series of FDR-corrected <italic>t</italic>-tests.

We also confirmed that the noise in single/double mutants was not different to the gene expression noise in isolates from low, intermediate, and high mutation probability libraries (mutants with no expression: F<sub>166,1494</sub> = 0.765; p=0.746; mutants with expression: F<sub>180,1620</sub> = 1.385; p=0.485). Then, we calculated epistasis in the presence of CI from flow cytometry measurements in the same manner as described for plate reader measurements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata4">Figure 3—source data 4</xref>). To evaluate the significance of calculated deviations from the additive expectation (epistasis), we use error propagation on the standard deviation obtained from the combined flow cytometry distributions of the two replicates, and not on the variance between means of replicate measurements (since the measured means for each isolated mutant were near identical between replicates). Linear regression between the estimates of epistasis from the two types of measurements shows that flow cytometry gives the same description of epistasis as the plate reader measurements (F<sub>1,58</sub> = 350.5; p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>Because all 150 double mutants were sequenced, we could test if epistasis was associated with the location of mutations. For the <italic>trans</italic>-element, we identified three locations: the N-terminus and the C-terminus domains, and the linker region between them (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). For the <italic>cis</italic>-element, the mutations could either be in one of the CI operator sites, in the RNAP contact residues (−10 and −35 regions), in the sites that have direct contact with both, or those that do not have direct contact with either protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). Then, we tested if existence of epistasis depended on the location of point mutations through a Pearson’s Chi-squared test, which considered only the binary value for epistasis: either the presence of significant epistasis or its absence.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Experimentally accounting for the genetic regulatory structure of the system</title><p>We wanted to explore if accounting for the genetic regulatory structure of the studied system would improve our ability to predict the system DME from the DMEs of its components. To this end, we put together the low mutation probability <italic>trans-</italic>element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) and high mutation probability <italic>cis-</italic>element libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and measured the DME for this library in the manner described above. We put together these two libraries as they have approximately the same average number of mutations (seven for the <italic>trans-</italic> and six for the <italic>cis-</italic>element), allowing a comparison that is not influenced by the actual number of mutations in each of the two elements.</p><p>In order to experimentally predict the frequencies of phenotypes in each category of the low mutation <italic>trans-</italic>element +high mutation <italic>cis-</italic>element library, we partitioned the low mutation probability <italic>trans-</italic>element library in the presence, and high mutation probability <italic>cis-</italic>element library in the absence of CI. Using FACS, we partitioned each library into three bins, corresponding to the no expression, intermediate, and high expression phenotype categories. We sorted a minimum of 500,000 individuals into each bin, and grew them overnight in LB with 30 μg/ml kanamycin. Using these populations, we obtained a measure of sorting accuracy by obtaining a DME of each <italic>trans-</italic>element partition after overnight growth. We isolated the plasmids from all six partitioned populations (three <italic>cis</italic> and three <italic>trans</italic>), and cloned all possible combinations of <italic>cis-</italic> and <italic>trans-</italic>element partitions to make nine new mutant libraries. We obtained a DME for each of these libraries, in the manner described previously.</p><p>Then, we obtained a prediction for the frequency of phenotypes in each of the three categories for the system mutant library consisting of low mutation probability <italic>trans-</italic> and high mutation probability <italic>cis</italic>-elements. To do so, we weighted the frequencies of phenotypes in each category of each partition combination library in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> by the frequency of that partition in the original <italic>trans-</italic>element library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). For example, no expression <italic>trans</italic> +no expression <italic>cis</italic> library yielded 93.4% of phenotypes in ‘no expression’ category, and 6.6% of phenotypes in ‘intermediate phenotype’ category. These were weighted by 0.686, which is the frequency of phenotypes in no expression <italic>trans-</italic>element category from which this particular partition combination library was derived (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). All weighted frequencies in the three categories – ‘no expression phenotypes’, ‘intermediate phenotypes’, and ‘high expression phenotypes’ – across all nine partition combination DMEs were added up to obtain a prediction for the distribution of phenotypes for the whole system library. As a control that it is the presence of the <italic>cis</italic> mutants that leads to a more accurate prediction of frequencies in the three categories, we used the frequencies of phenotypes based on sorting accuracy. These two predicted distributions (experimental prediction based on partition libraries and the prediction based on sorting accuracy) were compared to the actual distributions using a Pearson’s Chi-squared test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Mathematically accounting for the genetic regulatory structure of the system</title><p>We tested if accounting for the genetic regulatory structure improved the naïve convolution-based prediction of the system DME. Similar to the experimental approach, we incorporated the knowledge of the effects of <italic>cis</italic> mutations in the absence of CI (<italic>F</italic><sup>--</sup><sub>cis</sub>). In addition to the previous analysis, we assume that <italic>trans</italic> mutants showing high expression phenotypes (namely, those mutants that have the same expression as the wildtype in the absence of CI) are loss-of-function mutants that do not bind any <italic>cis</italic> mutants. To incorporate this information into the convolution, we (i) removed the high expression peak from the <italic>trans</italic> DME; (ii) performed a convolution between the remainder of the <italic>trans</italic> DME and the <italic>f</italic><sub>cis</sub>, (iii) introduced a cutoff, and then, (iv) instead of adding back the high expression wildtype in the absence of CI (<italic>F</italic><sup>--</sup><sub>wt</sub>), we add the distribution of <italic>cis</italic> mutations in the absence of CI (<italic>F</italic><sup>--</sup><sub>cis</sub>). This distribution is, as for the naïve convolution, added in proportion to the removed high expression <italic>trans</italic> phenotypes to normalize the whole distribution. Then, we evaluated the difference between the predicted DME and the observed system DME using a Pearson’s Chi-squared test, as previously described. We did this for the three system libraries shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and for the high mutation probability <italic>cis</italic> +low mutation probability <italic>trans</italic> library, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Not all intermolecular epistasis arises from the genetic regulatory structure of the system</title><p>While considering the effects of <italic>cis</italic> mutations on RNAP binding (and hence accounting for the genetic regulatory structure of the system) explained much of intermolecular epistasis we observed in system DMEs, we wanted to evaluate the extent to which other mechanisms might be contributing to epistasis between the <italic>cis-</italic> and the <italic>trans</italic>-element. To this end, we designed a library of 150 system double mutants, by combining point mutations in <italic>cis-</italic> and <italic>trans</italic>-elements with specific phenotypes. Namely, we selected 150 <italic>trans</italic> mutants that exhibited full repression, and 150 <italic>cis-</italic>element mutants that exhibited high expression in the absence of CI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The system double mutant library made in this manner corresponds to the partition combination shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>. Note that not all 150 double mutants had a unique point mutation in the <italic>cis</italic>-element, since we could not identify 150 mutations in <italic>cis</italic> that did not significantly affect expression levels in the absence of CI. Then, we measured fluorescence levels for all double mutants and their constitutive single mutants, and from those measurements calculated epistasis, in the same manner as described above. Finally, we tested if existence of epistasis depended on the location of point mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata2">Figure 6—source data 2</xref>) with Pearson’s Chi-squared test, as previously described.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank N Barton, T Bergmiller, A Betancourt, K Bod’ova, C Igler, C Nizak, T Paixão, MPleska, D Siekhaus, M Steinrueck, and G Tkačik for their invaluable comments on the manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by Patricia Wittkopp as the Reviewing Editor and Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has assembled a list of concerns for you to consider.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The creative approach to investigating an important question (interactions among genetic changes affecting <italic>cis-</italic> and <italic>trans-</italic>regulatory components of a regulatory network) was applauded, but concerns were raised by two of the reviewers about the null model used to infer the effects of epistasis. Following discussion, we all agreed this is a major concern since this test underlies the core observation and advance of the paper, and must be convincingly addressed. I should note that the remedy for this concern is not straight forward to us, and we anticipate that it will require a proof of principle experiment with a small number of mutants and/or a much more sophisticated mathematical/statistical treatment to better model the null hypothesis. We are concerned that sufficiently addressing this concern will take more than the 2 months typically allowed by <italic>eLife</italic> for revisions prior to publication and/or result in findings that are less novel, but have decided to extend an opportunity to try to address this concern in a response letter.</p><p>Instead of our usual policy of consolidating the remarks, I am attaching the full set of reviews because the concerns are explained in more detail there.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Revise the null model to better align with prior work and theory, possibly including some proof-of-principle tests of the strategy adopted.</p><p>2) Provide stronger support for the conclusion that the interactions are epistatic (non-additive).</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The manuscript uses random mutants in a <italic>trans-</italic>acting repressor and its <italic>cis</italic> target and finds epistasis such that the combined <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> effects are not predicted by their effects alone. The work is conceptually novel and the data provide new insight into how regulatory systems might evolve. My main concern is what the expected phenotype distribution should look like in the absence of epistasis. In part this could be due to a lack of clarity in the definition of epistasis or the clarity of writing.</p><p>1) Epistasis is defined differently in different fields. In quantitative genetics (as in this study) it is a non-additive interaction. It appears the assumption is that the <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> components are additive on a log scale in the absence of epistasis. However, for fitness the assumption is often that epistasis is a deviation from multiplicative effects. The definition should be clearly stated.</p><p>2) Certain epistatic relationships are entirely expected. For example, in the absence of CI the phenotype of the <italic>cis</italic> + <italic>trans</italic> mutants should equal that of <italic>cis</italic> mutants regardless of <italic>trans</italic> effect since <italic>trans</italic> mutants are not expressed. This is nicely observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>3) The expected phenotype distribution in the absence of epistasis is not clear and perhaps incorrect. The interpretation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is that there are too many cells with intermediate expression phenotype than expected. However, under a simple additive case one should expect panel D (cis) + panel (G) <italic>trans</italic> to produce mostly intermediate phenotypes since the most common phenotype in panel D is low expression and the most common in panel G is high expression, and low + high = intermediate. That said, the authors recognize that high expression in panel G (trans) is likely non-functional CI. To account for this they subtract out the high expression of panel G using WT in the absence of CI. This doesn't make sense. When non-functional CI is combine with <italic>cis</italic> mutations one would expect to see a phenotype distribution of <italic>cis</italic> in the absence of CI, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>, which is much more uniform and has a lot of intermediate frequency phenotypes. Eyeballing it looks like this would generate an expected pattern close to that observed a lot of intermediate phenotypes. The interpretation for the intermediate class is that mutant <italic>Cis</italic> are binding to mutant <italic>cis-</italic>elements. However, I don't think the authors have clearly shown that the increased frequency of the intermediate class is different from what one expect in the absence of epistasis.</p><p>There is not an obvious solution to calculating the expected phenotype distribution. The options I see are given below. However, engaging a mathematical biologist or statistician to appropriate generate expected phenotype distributions may yield better options.</p><p>a) average of <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans.</italic> Note that the methods stats that convolution of <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> yields phenotypes outside of biological range. The average of two numbers can't be above both numbers so the convolution must be <italic>cis</italic>+<italic>trans</italic> rather than (<italic>cis</italic>+<italic>trans</italic>)/2.</p><p>b) use a categorical model where <italic>cis</italic> + non-functional <italic>trans</italic> (high) = <italic>cis</italic> in the absence of CI, <italic>cis</italic>+ functional CI (low) = <italic>cis</italic>, <italic>cis</italic> + intermediate <italic>trans</italic> = weighted average of <italic>cis</italic> effects with CI and <italic>cis</italic> effects without CI with weighting depending on the whether intermediate is closer to low or high expression.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> also shows expectations in the absence of epistasis that don't make sense. The results show that 7/9 system libraries show prevalent epistasis because adding in the <italic>cis</italic> mutants alters the phenotypic effects of the <italic>trans</italic> mutants. The figure and interpretation now seem to use a different definition of epistasis – the one used in classical genetics. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> the grey shows unmodified <italic>trans</italic> and orange shows <italic>trans</italic> which is modified by <italic>cis.</italic> Panel G is an example where low <italic>trans</italic> is combined with high <italic>cis</italic> mutants. Unmodified (grey) is low, modified (orange) is intermediate or high. The observed distribution is spread across low, intermediate and high expression. But this is exactly what one would expect under an additive model of low + high effects.</p><p>4) The convolution of libraries to get an expectation. A gamma distribution was used for the <italic>cis</italic> library. It would be better to use the actual empirical distribution through random sampling of <italic>cis</italic> effects and <italic>trans</italic> effects with replacement. What assumption was made about the <italic>trans</italic> distribution? It is bimodal so not easily fit to a standard distribution. Is it a gamma after subtraction?</p><p>5) Noise in expression should be mentioned as it could contribute as well to the sorting accuracy statements.</p><p>6) Properties of mutant library. How was the average mutation frequency measured (1%-7%), and are mutants Poisson distributed. Simply using estimates provided by mutagenesis kit is not a sufficient measure of the library complexity. The manuscript states that 40 clones were Sanger sequenced. Is this 40 for each of the low, intermediate and high? What are the observed average number of mutants? Simply stating that they conform to the expected distribution given by the kit is not ok, you should use the empirical estimate obtained from sequencing.</p><p>7) What is the frequency of plasmids with no insert from cloning, either for the CI protein or the <italic>cis</italic> element? Typically this is low, but clones are confirmed this way. In high throughput experiments there will always be some frequency of plasmids ligated without an insert.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Lagator et al. measure how mutations lead to phenotypic variation in gene expression at the systems levels. This minimal system based on phage lambda contains the CI repressor and a constitutive promoter driving <italic>venus-yfp</italic>. Three types of mutagenesis libraries were created: the '<italic>cis</italic>' library mutated the constitutive promoter, the 'trans' library mutated the protein coding sequence of the CI repressor, and the 'system' library mutated combined both sets of mutations. For each library flow cytometry was used to measure the Distribution of Mutational Effects (DME), the phenotypic variation in gene expression of the population. The main finding is that the quantitative shapes of the DME are different for the <italic>cis</italic>, <italic>trans</italic>, and combined libraries. In particular there is an excess of constructs in the combined library with intermediate expression levels. The authors claim epistasis between <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> mutations must be invoked to explain the intermediate level phenotypes in the DME of the combined libraries. The authors further discuss how phenotypically neutral mutations may express phenotypes in combination with other mutations.</p><p>I may be missing something here, but I think the main result of this manuscript may be trivial. There is a straw man hypothesis in the text which says that &quot;the intuitive expectation (is) that an increase in the number of mutations ought to result in an increase in non-functional ('no expression') phenotypes&quot;. I agree that an increased mutation will lead to more loss of function mutations, but in this system loss of function <italic>trans</italic> mutants in CI increase expression while loss of function <italic>cis</italic> mutations in the promoter either decrease expression through decreased polymerase binding or increase expression through decreased CI binding. We might very well expect the combined library to have more intermediate phenotypes as loss of function mutations that both increase and decrease expression average each other out. One need not necessarily invoke epistasis to explain the increase in intermediate phenotypes in the combined library.</p><p>I also disagree with the primary interpretation that there are many &quot;neutral&quot; <italic>cis</italic> mutations that then manifest phenotypically in combination with a <italic>trans</italic> mutation. This is one plausible interpretation. An opposite interpretation is that there are many highly penetrant <italic>trans</italic> mutations (21.7% in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) and that in combination with a <italic>cis</italic> mutation the effects of these <italic>trans</italic> mutations are buffered. The 10% increase in intermediate phenotypes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> almost exactly mirrors the 10% decrease in high expressing phenotypes. This suggests that a large fraction of intermediate phenotypes come from highly penetrant <italic>trans</italic> mutations being buffered by <italic>cis</italic> mutations, and not from silent <italic>cis</italic> mutations that interact with <italic>trans</italic> mutations. In other words the mass in the DME moves from the high expressing bin into the medium expressing bin, not from the low expressing bin into the medium bin.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This manuscript describes the DME for interacting <italic>cis-</italic> and <italic>trans-</italic>regulatory sequences in a well-defined regulatory system. The primary finding is that epistatic interactions between mutations in these two components produce a larger range of phenotypes than variation in either single component. On the one hand, this type of epistasis is perhaps required to emerge from the known interactions of CI and the <italic>cis-</italic>sequence in the system. On the other hand, the quantitative consequences of this epistasis have rarely been described in detail and I think it is interesting to see how these interactions shape the phenotypic space explored. The use of mutant alleles with multiple mutations and the absence of any discussion of the identity of mutations mediating the observed epistasis that would have provided more insight into molecular mechanisms reduced my enthusiasm for this work, however. In addition, how much does intramolecular epistasis contribute to the patterns reported? One point where these questions are ameliorated is in the analysis of 109 single point mutations in <italic>cis</italic> and 73 in trans, but the locations of these changes with CI and the promoter are not described. Looking at the identity of these mutations in more detail might provide some insight into the specific interactions between <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> acting factors that produced the intermediate expression phenotypes.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Intermolecular epistasis increases phenotypic variation in a gene regulatory system&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation was overseen byPatricia Wittkopp as the Reviewing and Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Justin Fay.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>We appreciate the authors response to the reviewer's comments and inclusion of additional data addressing the concerns raised. For example, the definitions of epistasis and the methodology used to compute the naive DME are now more clear and easier to understand. We also appreciated the comparison to an empirically derived DME that accounts for our molecular knowledge of the components of CI system in phage. We remain convinced this is an interesting dataset addressing an interesting question, but also remain concerned that the conclusions drawn depend on the assumptions of the model, some of which we think are not plausible. We also agree, however, that it is not clear what the &quot;correct&quot; set of assumptions should be, so are supportive of publication despite these concerns.</p><p>In light of this uncertainty, we think a modification of the title and adjustment of the conclusions is appropriate. For example, we think the title should convey that the structure of regulatory circuits determines patterns of epistasis rather than regulatory circuits generate lots of unexpected epistasis.</p><p>In addition, we ask that the authors clarify their work further (no new data is needed). For example, two areas that seem fundamental to understanding the paper are: Does low + low = high expression under a naive model? If so what does low + high equal under an additive model? I'm still not sure. Statements like: &quot;increasing the number of mutated components should introduce additional constraints, limiting the variation accessible through mutation&quot; remain confusing. I am including the full comments from reviewer #1 below because they explain these remaining questions more fully.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this resubmitted manuscript, the authors revised their analysis and included substantial additional data. Primarily, they measured expression from 150 point mutations along with their double mutants. Overall the manuscript is greatly improved: it is more clearly presented and the individual single double mutant assays provides much greater confidence in their main result – epistasis between <italic>cis-trans</italic> mutants such that mutant <italic>trans-</italic>elements can bind mutant <italic>cis-</italic>elements generating expression patterns not expected from either mutant alone. However, as brought up in the initial review, the calculation of the double mutant expectations is problematic. In part, this may be related to clarity/understanding, but it could also indicate a problem in how these expectations were calculated. The expectations that I find problematic occur in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, but also in the double mutants, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> along with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>Overall, there are some strong indications of surprising epistasis. For me this came from looking at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> through <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref> showing both the doubles and singles. However, eyeballing it is not easy and it would be much easier to read using bargraphs of single, single, double (obs) and expected. The examples of doubles with negative epistasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) seem to be quite small deviations since they look simply like a combination of the two single mutants. However, the cases with positive epistasis are striking in that many show low + low = intermediate rather than low which is what I believe the expectation to be.</p><p>While the examples are nice, the main analysis contains expectations that I don't find logical for the naive analysis. &quot;Increasing the number of mutated components should introduce additional constraints, limiting the variation accessible through mutation&quot;: I disagree, given two sources of variation, combining them will increase variation beyond each individual component.</p><p>Central to the calculation of epistasis is the use of the convolution of <italic>cis</italic> + <italic>trans</italic> effects to derive an expectation for the system (doubles). This expectation is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. The question is what do we expect when we combine a low (<italic>cis</italic>) with either a low (trans) or high (trans) expression mutant. The convolution predicts this will mostly be high with a small amount of intermediate and low. Under a simple additive model one would expect low + low = low, and low + high = intermediate, which is quite similar to what is found. What is not clear to me is whether this is a problem in calculating the convolution of three DMEs or the assumptions in applying the convolution to get an expected level of expression. I think there must be clarity and agreement on what the expectation of low + high should be from the <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> library.</p><p>The 150 single mutants show similar patterns to what I would expect based on an additive model.</p><p>71/150 deviate from additive expectation. However, F2-2 shows that most single mutants have no effect (i.e. low expression). Why then do most of the observed doubles have an effect in the range of 1-3 when their effect should be zero? These observations are at odds with one another.</p><p>If the argument that high (trans) + low (cis) should be high expression because the repressor doesn't work, then this is exactly what one would expect if you include epistasis as a consequence of the way the regulatory system works and so is not really insightful. While this is a fine assumption to make later (non-naive), the simplest naive expectation needs to be understandable before making things more complicated.</p><p>Why didn't the positional information predict those that affect expression? One would expect that changes in binding sites for RNAP or CI would have quite different effects on expression.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28921.037</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Revise the null model to better align with prior work and theory, possibly including some proof-of-principle tests of the strategy adopted.</p><p>2) Provide stronger support for the conclusion that the interactions are epistatic (non-additive).</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the Editors and the reviewers for dedicating their time and energy to our manuscript, and for providing us with insightful and detailed feedback and criticism that undoubtedly strengthened our work.</p><p>We previously provided a plan on how to tackle the problems identified by the reviewers. This resubmission contains all the experiments we promised to do, as well as some additional analyses that we did not mention in the plan and that we felt would make our claims substantially stronger (for example, the analyses of the relationship between epistasis and location of mutations, and the convolutions that account for the genetic structure of the system). Together, the new evidence provides strong support for the existence of intermolecular epistasis in our system and demonstrates that the effects of such epistasis on shaping the evolution of transcriptional regulatory systems are significant.</p><p>In the revised version of the manuscript, we addressed the two essential revisions in the following ways:</p><p>1) We address the first essential revision by explaining in more detail why convolution is the correct null model against which to estimate epistasis for a DME. In particular, we outline how a prediction of epistasis in the absence of any knowledge of the underlying molecular mechanisms (which is what a ‘naïve’ convolution in the manuscript calculates) is meaningful. We were encouraged by our discussions with several mathematical biologists and population geneticists, including Nick H. Barton, who confirmed that convolution is the standard approach to estimating combined DMEs.</p><p>2) While the deviation of observed DMEs from those predicted by convolutions provides evidence for the existence of epistasis between <italic>cis-</italic> and <italic>trans-</italic>elements, we included additional experiments to better assess how prevalent such interactions are, and to determine their molecular and mechanistic origins. Specifically, we addressed the second essential revision more thoroughly by creating two additional libraries, each consisting of 150 double mutants and their corresponding single mutants. These libraries allowed us to estimate how common intermolecular epistasis is, and how frequently do epistatic interactions arise that cannot be explained by the underlying genetic regulatory structure. As we now know the identity of these mutants, this allowed us to analyze the relationship between the location of mutations and epistasis.</p><p>3) By conducting convolution predictions of the system DMEs that account for the underlying genetic regulatory structure, which allowed us to demonstrate that much of intermolecular epistasis comes from the mechanism of how the system functions. This analysis was done as a complement to the experimental approach of combining library partitions (old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, which is now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The manuscript uses random mutants in a trans-acting repressor and its <italic>cis</italic> target and finds epistasis such that the combined <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> effects are not predicted by their effects alone. The work is conceptually novel and the data provide new insight into how regulatory systems might evolve. My main concern is what the expected phenotype distribution should look like in the absence of epistasis. In part this could be due to a lack of clarity in the definition of epistasis or the clarity of writing.</p><p>1) Epistasis is defined differently in different fields. In quantitative genetics (as in this study) it is a non-additive interaction. It appears the assumption is that the <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> components are additive on a log scale in the absence of epistasis. However, for fitness the assumption is often that epistasis is a deviation from multiplicative effects. The definition should be clearly stated.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right to point out the lack of clarity in our definition of epistasis. Throughout the manuscript, our phenotype of interest is log<sub>10</sub> of fluorescence, and we calculate epistasis as the deviation from the additive assumption. This means that, on a linear scale, we calculate epistasis as a deviation from the multiplicative assumption. In the two libraries of 150 double mutants, we calculate epistasis as the deviation of the log<sub>10</sub> of wildtype-normalized fluorescence of the double mutant from the sum of the log<sub>10</sub> of wildtype-normalized fluorescence of the two single mutants. To predict the DME of the system through a convolution, we adopt the same approach. As such, we employ the same null model for both types of data. Throughout the manuscript we improved the clarity of how we define epistasis (in particular, see section ‘intermolecular epistasis drives the increase in phenotypic variation’, and the Materials and methods sections ‘Naïve convolution of component distributions as the null model for additivity between mutations’, and ‘Epistasis between random point mutants’).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Certain epistatic relationships are entirely expected. For example, in the absence of CI the phenotype of the <italic>cis</italic> + <italic>trans</italic> mutants should equal that of <italic>cis</italic> mutants regardless of trans effect since trans mutants are not expressed. This is nicely observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p></disp-quote><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> shows DMEs in the absence of CI. Of course, as the reviewer pointed out, in such conditions, the three <italic>trans</italic> mutation libraries (panels E,F,G) should be indistinguishable from the wildtype in panel A, and we show them primarily as a consistency check that none of the <italic>trans</italic> mutants have any effect in this environment. In the language of convolutions, the underlying “true” distribution of our <italic>trans</italic> library here is a δ-function, a unit element for the operation of convolution. Convolving any distribution with it yields the same distribution. This interpretation is consistent with the observation that <italic>cis</italic> DMEs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> are virtually indistinguishable from system DMEs. We discuss these observations in subsection “Naïve convolution of component distributions as the null model for additivity between mutations”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The expected phenotype distribution in the absence of epistasis is not clear and perhaps incorrect. The interpretation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is that there are too many cells with intermediate expression phenotype than expected. However, under a simple additive case one should expect panel D (<italic>cis</italic>) + panel (G) trans to produce mostly intermediate phenotypes since the most common phenotype in panel D is low expression and the most common in panel G is high expression, and low + high = intermediate. That said, the authors recognize that high expression in panel G (<italic>trans</italic>) is likely non-functional CI. To account for this they subtract out the high expression of panel G using WT in the absence of CI. This doesn't make sense. When non-functional CI is combine with <italic>cis</italic> mutations one would expect to see a phenotype distribution of <italic>cis</italic> in the absence of CI, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>, which is much more uniform and has a lot of intermediate frequency phenotypes. Eyeballing it looks like this would generate an expected pattern close to that observed a lot of intermediate phenotypes. The interpretation for the intermediate class is that mutant Cis are binding to mutant cis-elements. However, I don't think the authors have clearly shown that the increased frequency of the intermediate class is different from what one expect in the absence of epistasis.</p></disp-quote><p>In the new version of the manuscript, we distinguish between two approaches to performing a convolution. One is done in the absence of any knowledge of the genetic regulatory structure of the system. This approach is equivalent, conceptually, to how epistasis would be calculated for mutations in, for example, a protein, where there is little underlying mechanistic understanding of what those mutations might do. Note that it is deviations from this kind of a model, rather than a more complex one that accounts for the regulatory structure, that have a well-documented impact on organismal evolution. For this reason, we rely on this ‘naïve’ convolution as the null model against which to estimate epistasis (subsection “Intermolecular epistasis arises from the genetic regulatory structure of the system” and “Naïve convolution of component distributions as the null model for additivity between mutations”).</p><p>The second approach relies on the reviewer’s suggestion to “put back” the population of non-functional CIs, after convolution, as a distribution of <italic>cis</italic> in the absence of CI, which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>. We use this approach to demonstrate how a good portion of intermolecular epistasis can be attributed to the underlying molecular mechanism of how the system functions (by which we simply mean that a high expression <italic>trans</italic> mutation is a loss of function mutation, whose phenotype in the system would be that of the <italic>cis</italic> mutant in the absence of CI). Indeed, as the reviewer hypothesized, doing the convolutions in this manner results in a more accurate prediction of the system distribution (subsection “Intermolecular epistasis arises from the genetic regulatory structure of the system” and “Mathematically accounting for the genetic regulatory structure of the system”). We would like to thank the reviewer for this very helpful suggestion.</p><p>The justification for why we removed (and then put back) the high expression peak of the <italic>trans</italic> library even for the ‘naïve’ convolution is to prevent the predicted DME from having expression levels outside the biologically realistic range. In particular, the upper limit to expression is set by the strength of the P<sub>R</sub> promoter, which is one of the strongest known promoters in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Therefore, by removing the high expression peak before convolution we simply impose this limit on the predicted system DME. This approach is biologically motivated, as high expression <italic>trans</italic> mutants are loss of function mutants (subsection “Naïve convolution of component distributions as the null model for additivity between mutations”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is not an obvious solution to calculating the expected phenotype distribution. The options I see are given below. However, engaging a mathematical biologist or statistician to appropriate generate expected phenotype distributions may yield better options.</p><p>a) average of <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic>. Note that the methods stats that convolution of <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> yields phenotypes outside of biological range. The average of two numbers can't be above both numbers so the convolution must be cis+trans rather than (cis+trans)/2.</p><p>b) use a categorical model where <italic>cis</italic> + non-functional <italic>trans</italic> (high) = cis in the absence of CI, cis+ functional CI (low) = <italic>cis</italic>, <italic>cis</italic> + intermediate <italic>trans</italic> = weighted average of <italic>cis</italic> effects with CI and <italic>cis</italic> effects without CI with weighting depending on the whether intermediate is closer to low or high expression.</p></disp-quote><p>In discussions with several mathematical biologists and population geneticists, including Nick Barton, we have come to be persuaded that the right null model is the ‘naïve’ convolution, as it is the mathematical equivalent of the standard definition of epistasis as ε = m<sub>12</sub> / (m<sub>1</sub> x m<sub>2</sub>). We hope that the explanations we have provided in the manuscript (subsection “Intermolecular epistasis arises from the genetic regulatory structure of the system” and “Naïve convolution of component distributions as the null model for additivity between mutations”) and in our answer to the previous part of reviewer 1 – comment 3 justify our choice and persuade the reviewer that the convolution is, indeed, the correct null model against which to evaluate the presence of epistasis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> also shows expectations in the absence of epistasis that don't make sense. The results show that 7/9 system libraries show prevalent epistasis because adding in the <italic>cis</italic> mutants alters the phenotypic effects of the trans mutants. The figure and interpretation now seem to use a different definition of epistasis – the one used in classical genetics. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> the grey shows unmodified trans and orange shows trans which is modified by <italic>cis</italic>. Panel G is an example where low trans is combined with high <italic>cis</italic> mutants. Unmodified (grey) is low, modified (orange) is intermediate or high. The observed distribution is spread across low, intermediate and high expression. But this is exactly what one would expect under an additive model of low + high effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer’s comments – we did switch our definition of epistasis at this point (unfortunately, without realizing it ourselves!), and had done so in a way that was not consistent. Specifically, calculating epistasis as the deviation from a multiplicative expectation of two DMEs obtained in different environments that can never coexist does not make sense. Thanks to the reviewer’s comment, we have excluded such analysis from the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Instead, we utilized this data only to demonstrate how linking the genetic structure of a regulatory system can help elucidate the molecular basis of epistasis. Because by “genetic structure of a system” we specifically mean accounting for the effects of mutations in <italic>cis</italic> in the absence of CI, we combined the <italic>cis</italic> library in the absence of CI with the <italic>trans</italic> library in the presence of CI.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The convolution of libraries to get an expectation. A gamma distribution was used for the <italic>cis</italic> library. It would be better to use the actual empirical distribution through random sampling of <italic>cis</italic> effects and trans effects with replacement. What assumption was made about the trans distribution? It is bimodal so not easily fit to a standard distribution. Is it a gamma after subtraction?</p></disp-quote><p>Convolving empirical distributions directly suffers from two problems: 1) we would need to deconvolve noise from one of them; 2) convolution is highly unstable numerically and yields non-interpretable results. Having at least one distribution in its analytic form remedies numerical problems. In order to obtain an analytical form of one distribution (<italic>cis</italic> in our case), we “reverse engineered” it, so that the convolution of the analytical form with the wildtype distribution matches the observed <italic>cis</italic> distribution as closely as possible. We changed the text in order to better explain this point (subsection “Naïve convolution of component distributions as the null model for additivity between mutations”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Noise in expression should be mentioned as it could contribute as well to the sorting accuracy statements.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, and have now conducted additional experiments to understand how gene expression noise might be affecting our findings. By observing gene expression levels in 180 monoclonal isolates from experimental mutant libraries and in 180 single/double mutants, we tested if gene expression noise depended on: (i) gene expression levels; (ii) frequency of mutations (single, double, low, intermediate, and high mutation frequency); and (iii) location of mutations (<italic>cis, trans</italic>, or system). We found no differences in gene expression noise between isolated mutants. We describe these findings in the manuscript (subsection “Mutating the whole system increases phenotypic variation” and “Estimating gene expression noise from flow cytometry measurements”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Properties of mutant library. How was the average mutation frequency measured (1%-7%), and are mutants Poisson distributed. Simply using estimates provided by mutagenesis kit is not a sufficient measure of the library complexity. The manuscript states that 40 clones were Sanger sequenced. Is this 40 for each of the low, intermediate and high? What are the observed average number of mutants? Simply stating that they conform to the expected distribution given by the kit is not ok, you should use the empirical estimate obtained from sequencing.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for the lack of clarity on this issue. We sequenced 40 clones from each <italic>cis</italic> and each <italic>trans</italic> library, and found that the distribution of mutations for each library is not significantly different from the expected distribution.

This is most likely because we used two pairs of non-complimentary restriction sites for cloning the <italic>cis-</italic> and the <italic>trans-</italic>element mutants.

In the new version of the manuscript, we demonstrate that much of intermolecular epistasis comes from an obvious interaction – what we term ‘genetic regulatory structure of the system’. We demonstrate this experimentally and mathematically (subsection “Intermolecular epistasis arises from the genetic regulatory structure of the system”). We also include a discussion on the fact that deviations from a naïve additive assumption for interactions between mutations are what shape the adaptive landscape. Throughout the manuscript, we now include a more in depth discussion of all of the points raised in this comment (especially in the section ‘intermolecular epistasis drives the increase in phenotypic variation’,).

On the one hand, this type of epistasis is perhaps required to emerge from the known interactions of CI and the <italic>cis</italic>-sequence in the system. On the other hand, the quantitative consequences of this epistasis have rarely been described in detail and I think it is interesting to see how these interactions shape the phenotypic space explored. The use of mutant alleles with multiple mutations and the absence of any discussion of the identity of mutations mediating the observed epistasis that would have provided more insight into molecular mechanisms reduced my enthusiasm for this work, however.</p></disp-quote><p>While our focus in the original submission was to describe the phenotypic consequences of intermolecular epistasis, we agree with the reviewer that our findings would be strengthened if we could provide some detail on the kinds of mutations that result in the observed patterns. In the mutant libraries used in the original submission, the mutation numbers were too high to do this. Therefore, we created two new mutant libraries with 150 double mutants and their corresponding single mutants. For every single and double mutant in these libraries we know the identity and location of mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3–source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata2">Figure 6– source data 2</xref>). We analyze this data to identify if the location of mutations has any effect on the existence of epistasis, and find that much of negative epistasis in the system stems from loss-of-function <italic>trans</italic> mutations. Maybe more interestingly, the existence of interactions that <italic>cannot</italic> be explained by the underlying regulatory structure of the system are more likely to be found in the linker region of the repressor CI (“Accounting for the genetic regulatory structure of the system does not explain all intermolecular epistasis”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, how much does intramolecular epistasis contribute to the patterns reported?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right to ask about intramolecular epistasis. Of course, there must be interactions between mutations in <italic>cis</italic> alone, as well as between mutations in <italic>trans</italic> alone. For our findings to be valid, we assume that the nature of interactions between mutations in <italic>cis</italic> does not depend on the <italic>trans</italic> background. Conversely, we also assume that the epistasis between <italic>trans</italic> mutations is independent of mutations in <italic>cis</italic>. In other words, we assume that intramolecular epistasis in each component is independent of the mutations in the other component. We cannot conceive of an experimental design by which to test these assumptions, and as such are limited to only discussing them. Having said that, we hope that some of these concerns are addressed by looking at the two 150 system single/double mutant libraries, since in those double mutants there is no intramolecular epistasis (as one point mutation is in <italic>cis</italic> and the other in <italic>trans</italic>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One point where these questions are ameliorated is in the analysis of 109 single point mutations in <italic>cis</italic> and 73 in <italic>trans</italic>, but the locations of these changes with CI and the promoter are not described. Looking at the identity of these mutations in more detail might provide some insight into the specific interactions between <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> acting factors that produced the intermediate expression phenotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>With the expansion of the single mutant libraries, and the addition of two system double mutant libraries consisting of 150 unique double mutants, we provide insight into where the mutations that lead to an interaction might be located in the <italic>cis</italic> and the <italic>trans-</italic>element. For 150 random double mutants, we do not find any relationship between epistasis and the location of mutations (subsection “Intermolecular epistasis drives the increase in phenotypic variation”). However, we find that the positive epistasis that emerges from a novel binding property of a repressor mutant is associated with the linker region connecting the DNA binding domain and the dimerization domain of the protein (subsection “Accounting for the genetic regulatory structure of the system does not explain all intermolecular epistasis”).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We appreciate the authors response to the reviewer's comments and inclusion of additional data addressing the concerns raised. For example, the definitions of epistasis and the methodology used to compute the naive DME are now more clear and easier to understand. We also appreciated the comparison to an empirically derived DME that accounts for our molecular knowledge of the components of CI system in phage. We remain convinced this is an interesting dataset addressing an interesting question, but also remain concerned that the conclusions drawn depend on the assumptions of the model, some of which we think are not plausible. We also agree, however, that it is not clear what the &quot;correct&quot; set of assumptions should be, so are supportive of publication despite these concerns.</p><p>In light of this uncertainty, we think a modification of the title and adjustment of the conclusions is appropriate. For example, we think the title should convey that the structure of regulatory circuits determines patterns of epistasis rather than regulatory circuits generate lots of unexpected epistasis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the editors and the reviewers for suggesting a modification to the title, which we think now better captures the main point of our work. As the reviewers and editors pointed out, whether an increase in intermediate phenotypes can be attributed to epistasis is after all dependent on how one calculates/defines epistasis. What our work shows is that accounting for the underlying molecular mechanisms (in our case in the form of the structure of the gene regulatory network) can help to better define how mutations interact with each other. The new title should emphasize this point more clearly. In addition, we modified the Discussion section to emphasize how our results indicate that null models of epistasis can be inaccurate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, we ask that the authors clarify their work further (no new data is needed). For example, two areas that seem fundamental to understanding the paper are: Does low + low = high expression under a naive model? If so what does low + high equal under an additive model? I'm still not sure.</p></disp-quote><p>We made several changes to the manuscript in order to better clarify the naïve null model used in our study. Most importantly, we introduced a new table (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), which shows the predictions not only for ‘low’ – ‘low’ and ‘low’ – ‘high’, but for how all combinations of the three categorical mutational effects (those leading to ‘no’, ‘intermediate’, or ‘high’ expression phenotypes) interact under an additive null model. This table provides an intuitive understanding for how the additive null model works when considering distributions of mutational effects.</p><p>Furthermore, we recognize from the comments of reviewer #1 that we were not clear in our description of how we convolved two distributions. We convolved the observed <italic>trans</italic> DME (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) with the ‘true’ distribution of effects in <italic>cis</italic>. This ‘true’ distribution shows how mutations in <italic>cis</italic> modify wildtype expression levels – and effectively all mutations in <italic>cis</italic> are either neutral or increase expression (as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7A</xref>). Because of this, convolving a low expression <italic>trans</italic> distribution with the ‘true’ <italic>cis</italic> distribution would result in an increase in intermediate and high expression phenotypes, because mutations in <italic>cis</italic> are either neutral or increase expression. Similarly, convolving a high expression <italic>trans</italic> DME with the ‘true’ <italic>cis</italic> distribution would result in only high expression phenotypes. We have introduced changes both in the main text (subsection “Intermolecular epistasis drives the increase in phenotypic variation”) and in the Materials and methods, in order to further clarify how the predictions by the ‘naïve’ convolution were made.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Statements like: &quot;increasing the number of mutated components should introduce additional constraints, limiting the variation accessible through mutation&quot; remain confusing. I am including the full comments from reviewer #1 below because they explain these remaining questions more fully.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not intend this line to describe anything about the null model we used, but rather only as an illustration of how surprising our results were to us. We now understand how it could have caused confusion, and have as such removed it entirely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this resubmitted manuscript, the authors revised their analysis and included substantial additional data. Primarily, they measured expression from 150 point mutations along with their double mutants. Overall the manuscript is greatly improved: it is more clearly presented and the individual single double mutant assays provides much greater confidence in their main result – epistasis between <italic>cis</italic>-<italic>trans</italic> mutants such that mutant trans-elements can bind mutant <italic>cis</italic>-elements generating expression patterns not expected from either mutant alone.</p></disp-quote><p>We are glad to see that our new experimental data on the libraries of 150 single/double point mutations has greatly improved our main results and we thank the reviewer for the encouraging feedback.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, as brought up in the initial review, the calculation of the double mutant expectations is problematic. In part, this may be related to clarity/understanding, but it could also indicate a problem in how these expectations were calculated. The expectations that I find problematic occur in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, but also in the double mutants, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> along with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>.</p></disp-quote><p>Throughout the manuscript we define epistasis as the deviation from the additive assumption (given that we use log<sub>10</sub> of expression as our phenotype of interest). Given that the wildtype used in this study has no measurable expression, effectively all mutations (in either <italic>cis</italic> or <italic>trans</italic>) are either neutral or increase expression. According to the additive null model, if an effect of a mutation is positive, in the absence of epistasis that effect should remain positive and have the same magnitude irrespective of the background. We have introduced <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> to provide an illustration of this null model by showing its predictions on three categorical phenotypes (no, intermediate, and high expression). We made substantial changes to the text to improve clarity of how we calculate the null model for DMEs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (subsection “Intermolecular epistasis drives the increase in phenotypic variation”; “Naïve convolution of component distributions as the null model for additivity between mutations”). We also clarified that, when calculating epistasis of double mutants shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, we use wildtype-normalized single mutant effects (subsection “Intermolecular epistasis drives the increase in phenotypic variation”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, there are some strong indications of surprising epistasis. For me this came from looking at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> through <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref> showing both the doubles and singles. However, eyeballing it is not easy and it would be much easier to read using bargraphs of single, single, double (obs) and expected.</p></disp-quote><p>The primary purpose of including <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figures 3—figure supplement 3</xref> through <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref> was to demonstrate that estimating epistasis from flow cytometry measurements was the same as from plate reader measurements (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>, which was previously <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), therefore justifying our use of plate reader measurements for the two single/double mutant libraries. Because the two measurements are equivalent, we now include bar charts for all 150 random double mutants and their corresponding single mutants, measured in the plate reader (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The examples of doubles with negative epistasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) seem to be quite small deviations since they look simply like a combination of the two single mutants.

It does not describe our null model in any way. It was simply there to illustrate why we originally found the results surprising, to contrast our results to some intuitive expectation that we had prior to actually conducting experiments. Given that this sentence served such a minor purpose, and that it resulted in a more serious confusion, we removed it from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Central to the calculation of epistasis is the use of the convolution of <italic>cis</italic> + <italic>trans</italic> effects to derive an expectation for the system (doubles). This expectation is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. The question is what do we expect when we combine a low (<italic>cis</italic>) with either a low (trans) or high (trans) expression mutant. The convolution predicts this will mostly be high with a small amount of intermediate and low. Under a simple additive model one would expect low + low = low, and low + high = intermediate, which is quite similar to what is found. What is not clear to me is whether this is a problem in calculating the convolution of three DMEs or the assumptions in applying the convolution to get an expected level of expression. I think there must be clarity and agreement on what the expectation of low + high should be from the <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> library.</p></disp-quote><p>We now realize that the revised version of the manuscript was lacking clarity in our description of how we carried out the convolution. We do not convolve two distributions as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Instead, we convolve the <italic>trans</italic> distribution shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> with the ‘true’ <italic>cis</italic> distribution. This ‘true’ distribution is nothing more than a <italic>cis</italic> distribution (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) relative to the wildtype, which shows how mutations in <italic>cis</italic> alter wildtype expression. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7A</xref>, mutations in <italic>cis</italic> either do not affect wildtype expression (are effectively neutral), or increase it. Because of this, convolving the ‘true’ <italic>cis</italic> distribution with the hypothetical low <italic>trans</italic> distribution would result in an increase in the frequency of intermediate and high expression mutants. This is one of the reasons why convolution predictions seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> contain a relatively high frequency of high expression mutants. The second reason is that we introduce a threshold to high expression, by setting the maximum possible expression to that of the wildtype in the absence of CI. The fact that the <italic>P<sub>R</sub></italic> promoter is one of the strongest known promoters justifies this threshold. Without this threshold, convolving high expression <italic>trans</italic> mutants with the ‘true’ <italic>cis</italic> distribution would result in many mutants with higher expression than the wildtype. With the threshold (as explained in the Materials and methods section “Naïve convolution of component distributions as the null model for additivity between mutations”), convolution of high expression <italic>trans</italic> mutants with the ‘true’ <italic>cis</italic> distribution results in only high expression phenotypes.</p><p>For these two reasons, convolving the <italic>trans</italic> DME with a ‘true’ <italic>cis</italic> distribution, which contains only neutral mutations and mutations that increase expression, results in a prediction that has an increase in the frequency of intermediate and high expression mutants, while showing a decrease in the frequency of low expression mutants. We now include a new table (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), which summarizes how the three categories of mutations (no, intermediate, and high expression mutations) interact under the additive null model. We also provide better explanations of how we utilized convolutions in the main text (subsection “Intermolecular epistasis drives the increase in phenotypic variation”) and in the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The 150 single mutants show similar patterns to what I would expect based on an additive model. 71/150 deviate from additive expectation. However, F2-2 shows that most single mutants have no effect (i.e. low expression). Why then do most of the observed doubles have an effect in the range of 1-3 when their effect should be zero? These observations are at odds with one another.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion and the lack of detail in the way we presented the single/double mutant data. We introduce this dataset of random 150 double mutants in order to demonstrate that the existence of intermolecular epistasis, identified through a deviation from the convolution prediction, is also present in our system when only a single point mutation is introduced in each of the components. We find that combinations of point mutations in <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic>, which mainly result in low expression phenotypes, sometimes have higher expression when combined. This increase is due to intermolecular epistasis between them, which we calculate as the deviation of the observed double mutant effect (normalized by the wildtype) from the predicted effect (wildtype-normalized <italic>cis</italic> mutant * wildtype-normalized <italic>trans</italic> mutant effect). In order to further clarify and provide information on how single mutations interact, we have now added a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), which contains the data for each double mutant, its corresponding single mutants, and the prediction based on the additive model.</p><p>On a mechanistic level, one can hypothesize how these interactions arise. Significant epistasis can be observed when a high expression <italic>trans</italic> mutant results in a low or intermediate expression system phenotype, when combined with a <italic>cis</italic> mutation.This kind of epistasis contributes to the observed increase in intermediate phenotypes in the system. In addition, some double mutants are in positive epistasis because <italic>trans</italic> mutants can fully bind the wildtype <italic>cis</italic>, while binding the mutated <italic>cis</italic> less well than the wildtype <italic>trans</italic> does. This scenario would also result in intermediate phenotypes arising from a combination of low <italic>cis</italic> + low <italic>trans</italic> mutations. The introduction of the new figure showing single mutant effects, as well as the predicted and the observed double mutant effects for all 150 random mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) provides further insight into how each pair of mutations interacts specifically.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If the argument that high (<italic>trans</italic>) + low (<italic>cis</italic>) should be high expression because the repressor doesn't work, then this is exactly what one would expect if you include epistasis as a consequence of the way the regulatory system works and so is not really insightful. While this is a fine assumption to make later (non-naive), the simplest naive expectation needs to be understandable before making things more complicated.</p></disp-quote><p>In obtaining the ‘naïve’ convolution, we do not make any assumptions about the underlying nature of high expression <italic>trans</italic> mutants. We removed the sentence in the Materials and methods section“Naïve convolution of component distributions as the null model for additivity between mutations” that could have been misinterpreted as suggesting that we make such an assumption. We have previously included this sentence only to provide another biological justification for the threshold we impose on high expression phenotypes. Our argument for why high <italic>trans</italic> convolved with the ‘true’ <italic>cis</italic> distribution results in high expression phenotypes is because mutations in <italic>cis</italic> are either neutral or increase the expression level. We now clarify this point in the main text (subsection “Intermolecular epistasis drives the increase in phenotypic variation”), in the Materials and methods, and in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why didn't the positional information predict those that affect expression? One would expect that changes in binding sites for RNAP or CI would have quite different effects on expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We only studied whether the location of mutations had an effect on the existence and magnitude of epistasis, and not on whether different positions in the binding site have different effects on expression.
