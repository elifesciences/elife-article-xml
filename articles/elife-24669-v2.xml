How organisms adapt is often limited by trade-offs, in which improving one trait can only come at the expense of another.</p><p>In the laboratory, scientists use well-controlled environments to study how populations adapt to specific challenges without interference from their natural habitat. Most experiments, however, only look at simple challenges and do not take into account that organisms in the wild face many pressures at the same time. Fraebel et al. wanted to know what happens when an organism’s performance depends on two traits that are restricted by a trade-off. The experiments used populations of the bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli,</italic> which can go through hundreds of generations in a week, providing ample opportunity to study mutations and their impact on heritable traits.</p><p>Through a combination of mathematical modeling and experiments, Fraebel et al. found that the environment is crucial for determining how bacteria adapt when their swimming speed and population growth rate are restricted by a trade-off. When nutrients are plentiful, <italic>E. coli</italic> populations evolve to spread faster by swimming more quickly despite growing more slowly. Yet, if nutrients are scarcer, the bacteria evolve to spread faster by growing more quickly despite swimming more slowly. In each scenario, the experiments identified single mutations that changed both swimming speed and growth rate by modifying regulatory activity in the cell.</p><p>A better understanding of how an organism’s genetic architecture, its environment and trade-offs are connected may help identify the traits that are most easily changed by mutations. The ultimate goal would be to be able to predict evolutionary responses to complex selection pressures.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24669.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24669.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>phenotypic space</kwd><kwd>experimental evolution</kwd><kwd>phenotypic constraints</kwd><kwd>chemotaxis</kwd><kwd>trade-off</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PHY 0822613</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fraebel</surname><given-names>David T</given-names></name><name><surname>Mickalide</surname><given-names>Harry</given-names></name><name><surname>Schnitkey</surname><given-names>Diane</given-names></name><name><surname>Merritt</surname><given-names>Jason</given-names></name><name><surname>Kuhlman</surname><given-names>Thomas E</given-names></name><name><surname>Kuehn</surname><given-names>Seppe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PHY 1430124</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fraebel</surname><given-names>David T</given-names></name><name><surname>Mickalide</surname><given-names>Harry</given-names></name><name><surname>Schnitkey</surname><given-names>Diane</given-names></name><name><surname>Merritt</surname><given-names>Jason</given-names></name><name><surname>Kuhlman</surname><given-names>Thomas E</given-names></name><name><surname>Kuehn</surname><given-names>Seppe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Experimental evolution shows that when selection acts on two traits constrained by a trade-off, the direction of phenotypic evolution depends on the environment.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In nature organisms adapt to complex environments where many biotic and abiotic factors affect survival. For microbes these factors include demands on metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Savageau, 1983</xref>), motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Celani and Vergassola, 2010</xref>) and antibiotic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vetsigian et al., 2011</xref>). In this context, evolution involves the simultaneous adaptation of many phenotypic traits. Organisms under complex selection pressures often cannot vary traits independently and instead exhibit trade-offs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shoval et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Trade-offs constrain adaptive responses to selection. For example, phage exhibit a trade-off between fecundity and virulence which depends on the relative duration of periods of horizontal and vertical transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Messenger et al., 1999</xref>). Bacterial populations selected for efficient conversion of nutrients to biomass exhibit a trade-off between yield and growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bachmann et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Predicting evolution in complex environments requires quantifying both trade-offs and selection pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lande, 1979</xref>). In wild populations of birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grant and Grant, 1995</xref>) and fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghalambor et al., 2003</xref>), phenotypic constraints and selection pressures have been inferred from measurements of phenotypic variation. However, in wild populations of higher organisms it is challenging to observe evolution, determine selection pressures and elucidate mechanisms constraining phenotypes. To better understand the interplay between trade-offs, selection and evolution, it is necessary to study genetically tractable, rapidly evolving microbial populations in the laboratory.</p><p>However, laboratory-based experimental evolution of microbes typically selects for a single phenotype such as growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lang et al., 2013</xref>). There is evidence that metabolic trade-offs arise in these experiments from the decay of traits that are not subject to selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cooper and Lenski, 2000</xref>) rather than a compromise between multiple selection pressures. Other experiments explore how phenotypes restricted by trade-offs evolve under alternating selection for individual traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yi and Dean, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Messenger et al., 1999</xref>). Less is known about evolutionary dynamics in the naturally relevant regime where selection pressures are multifaceted.</p><p>To address this, we selected <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> for faster migration through a porous environment. We showed that the evolution of faster migration is constrained by a trade-off between swimming speed and growth rate. Evolution of faster migration in rich medium is driven by faster swimming despite slower growth, while faster migration in minimal medium is achieved through faster growth despite slower swimming. Sequencing and genetic engineering showed that this trade-off is due to antagonistic pleiotropy through mutations that affect negative regulation. Finally, a model of multi-trait selection supports the hypothesis that the direction of evolution when phenotypes are constrained by a trade-off is determined by the genetic variance of each trait. Our results show that when selection acts simultaneously on two traits governed by a trade-off, the environment determines the evolutionary trajectory.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental evolution of migration rate</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> inoculated at the center of a low viscosity agar plate consume nutrients locally, creating a spatial nutrient gradient which drives chemotaxis through the porous agar matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Righetti et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maaloum et al., 1998</xref>) and subsequent nutrient consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adler, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wolfe and Berg, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Croze et al., 2011</xref>). As a result, the outermost edge of the expanding colony is driven by both growth and motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koster et al., 2012</xref>). The result is a three-dimensional bacterial colony that expands radially across the plate as individuals swim and divide in the porous environment. We refer to the outermost edge of an expanding colony as the migrating front. We tracked these migrating fronts using webcams and light-emitting diode (LED) illumination (Materials and methods). The front migrates at a constant speed <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> after an initial growth phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adler, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wolfe and Berg, 1989</xref>).</p><p>We performed experimental evolution by repeating rounds of allowing a colony to expand for a fixed time interval, selecting a small population of cells from the migrating front and using them to inoculate a fresh low viscosity agar plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). By isolating cells from the migrating front, our procedure selects both for motility and growth rate. We performed selection experiments in this way for two distinct nutrient conditions. First, we used rich medium (lysogeny broth (LB), 0.3 % w/v agar, 30°C) where all amino acids are available. In this medium the population forms concentric rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) that consume amino acids sequentially. The outermost ring consumes L-serine and most of the oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adler, 1966</xref>). Second, we used minimal medium (M63, 0.18 mM galactose, 0.3 % w/v agar, 30°C) where populations migrate towards and metabolize galactose with a single migrating front.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24669.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>E. coli</italic> evolves faster migration through a porous environment in rich and minimal media.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) A schematic of the selection procedure. <italic>E. coli</italic> are inoculated into the center of a low viscosity (0.3 % w/v) agar plate where they form an expanding colony driven by metabolism and motility.

A portion of this sample was used to immediately inoculate a fresh plate while the remainder was preserved cryogenically. The process was repeated every 12 hr for 15 rounds. We observed a nearly 50% increase in <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf16"><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> over the course of the first 5 rounds of selection. The increase in <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf17"><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> was largely reproducible across five independent selection experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). We estimate that plate-to-plate variation in agar concentration due to evaporative loss could change the migration rate by up to 0.06 cm h<sup>−1</sup> in later rounds (Appendix 1). However, independent replicate selection experiments exhibit fluctuations in migration rate that exceed this estimate. For example, replicate 4 declines in later rounds of selection, and this decline may reflect the unique low abundance mutation that appears in this replicate by round 15 (Figure 5a). In addition, replicate 3 exhibits substantially faster migration than replicates 1, 2 and 4 in round 7, and this may reflect the distinct mutations observed in this replicate at round 5 (Figure 5a). So, while migration rates increased in all replicates, the magnitude of the increase differed between replicates.</p><p>To check whether chemotaxis was necessary for increasing <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf18"><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, we performed selection experiments using a motile but non-chemotactic mutant (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf19"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula><italic>cheA-Z</italic>, Materials and methods). Motility in this strain was confirmed by single-cell imaging in liquid media. As observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wolfe and Berg, 1989</xref>), the non-chemotactic strain formed dense colonies in low viscosity agar that remained localized near the site of inoculation and expanded <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf20"><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>1 cm in a 24 hr period: a rate 10-fold slower than the wild-type. To allow sufficient time for colony expansion, we performed selection experiments using this strain with 24 hr incubation times and observed an increase in <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf21"><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> from approximately 0.03 cm h<sup>−1</sup> to 0.04 cm h<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We did not observe fast migrating spontaneous mutants which have been reported previously in multiple species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wolfe and Berg, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mohari et al., 2015</xref>), likely because our plates were incubated for a shorter period of time.</p><p>To determine the number of generations transpiring in our selection experiments, we measured the number of cells in the inoculum and the number of cells in the colony after 12 hr of growth and expansion (Materials and methods). We estimated that 10 to 12 generations occurred in each round of selection. We then tested whether prolonged growth in well mixed liquid medium for a similar number of generations could lead to faster migration by growing the founding strain for 200 generations in continuous liquid culture and periodically inoculating a low viscosity agar plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We observed only a 3.5% increase in the rate of migration, demonstrating that selection performed on spatially structured populations results in more rapid adaptation for fast migration than growth in well mixed conditions.</p><p>We then performed selection experiments in a minimal medium where growth and migration are substantially slower than in rich medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). In this condition we allowed 48 hr for each round of expansion and took precautions to limit evaporative loss in the plates over this longer timescale (Materials and methods). In the first round, the population formed small <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf22"><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>1.5 cm diameter colonies without a well defined front. Populations formed well defined fronts in subsequent rounds of selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), reflecting a transition from growth and diffusion dominated transport to chemotaxis dominated migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Croze et al., 2011</xref>). We observed an approximately 3-fold increase in <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf23"><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> over the course of 10 rounds of selection. Variation across replicate experiments was substantial, and exceeded our estimate of systematic error due evaporative losses changing the agar concentration (Appendix 1). So while all replicates increased their migration rate, the magnitude of the increase in migration rate varied substantially. This variation may be due to the different mutations present across replicates (Figure 5b).</p><p>When we performed selection in minimal medium using the non-chemotactic mutant (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf24"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula><italic>cheA-Z</italic>), we found little or no migration and only a very small increase in the migration rate over 10 rounds of selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We concluded that chemotaxis is also necessary for increasing <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf25"><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> in this medium.</p><p>Using the same technique described for rich medium, we estimated the number of generations per round of selection in minimal medium to be &lt;10. We tested whether approximately 120 generations of growth in liquid was sufficient to evolve faster migration in minimal medium. Here we found that prolonged growth in well mixed conditions resulted in <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf26"><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>2-fold faster front migration. Despite the increase in migration rate, selection in well mixed conditions resulted in slower migration than selection in low viscosity agar plates for a similar number of generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Increasing swimming speed and growth rate increase migration rate</title><p>To characterize the adaptation we observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c,e</xref>, we studied a reaction-diffusion model of migrating bacterial fronts of the type pioneered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keller and Segel (1971)</xref> and reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tindall et al.

We note that this comparison involves no free parameters.</p><p>In rich medium our model describes the dynamics of a single metabolite/attractant (L-serine), and therefore fails to account for secondary fronts behind the outermost front, which arise from the metabolism of other amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adler, 1966</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This is a reasonable approximation since we select cells only from the outermost front of the colony. In minimal medium, where only a single nutrient is available, we observe only a single migrating front as our model predicts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Other limitations of this model include the fact that it does not describe the process of adaptation by chemoattractant receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berg and Tedesco, 1975</xref>), nor does it describe stochastic processes at the single-cell level such as trapping in the agar matrix and cell-to-cell variability. The discrepancy between predicted migration rate and our observed migration rate most likely arises from the fact that cells are transiently trapped in the agar matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wolfe and Berg, 1989</xref>) rather than simply being scattered. While more sophisticated models have been developed to include these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vladimirov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frankel et al., 2014</xref>), the model in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1 equ2">Equations 1, 2</xref> captures the essential features of bacterial front migration with fewer adjustable parameters.

Tracking strains isolated after 15 rounds from independent selection experiments (replicates 3 and 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) showed that this increase in run speed was reproducible across independent evolution experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Finally, to check that the phenotype we observed after 15 rounds of selection in rich medium was distinct from standard laboratory strains used in chemotaxis studies, we tracked RP437 and found that its swimming speed was slower than the round 15 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, when we performed single-cell tracking for strains evolved in minimal media we observed the opposite trend. In these conditions we observed a 50% reduction in run speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). Again, we found that this result was reproducible across independently evolved strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>While the overall trend in minimal medium was towards reduced run duration, one replicate showed an increase in run duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). The strain where we observed long runs after 10 rounds of selection (replicate 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>) also exhibited a slower migration rate than the strain isolated from replicate 1, and the long run durations may be responsible for this difference.</p><p>We then measured the growth rates of founding and evolved strains from both selection conditions in well mixed liquid corresponding to the medium used for selection (Appendix 1). We observed a decline of about 10% in the maximum growth rate with selection in rich medium and a three-fold increase in the maximum growth rate after 10 rounds of selection in minimal medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g-h</xref>). We found that these changes in growth rate are reproducible across independently evolved strains in both environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Since motility is known to depend on the growth history of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Staropoli and Alon, 2000</xref>), we checked whether the phenotypic differences between founding and evolved strains shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> remained valid when we tracked cells over a range of optical densities during population growth. We performed these measurements for the founding strain in both rich and minimal media, and for a round 15 strain in rich medium and a round 10 strain in minimal medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). For both rich and minimal media, we found that the differences in run speed (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf185"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) between founding and selected strains were retained across the growth curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4d</xref>). Likewise, in minimal medium, the average run duration was shorter for the selected strain than for the founder across the growth curve. For rich medium, average run durations for the round 15 strain were not consistently shorter than founder, but the round 15 strain exhibited smaller variability in run duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4b</xref>).</p><p>Combining growth rate measurements with single-cell motility measurements allowed us to predict the front migration rate for strains in rich and minimal media using the reaction-diffusion model described above.

In this condition we observed transient mutations in genes regulating chemotaxis or motility (near <italic>flhD</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>) in two of four replicates.</p><p>A previous study showed that mutations in <italic>clpX</italic> alter <italic>flhDC</italic> expression and motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Girgis et al., 2007</xref>). We therefore focused attention on the mutation in <italic>clpX</italic>, which converted position 185 from glutamic acid to a stop codon in the 424 residue <italic>ClpX</italic> protein. <italic>ClpX</italic> is the specificity subunit of the <italic>ClpX-ClpP</italic> serine protease. <italic>ClpX</italic> forms a homohexamer that consumes ATP to unfold and translocate target proteins to the <italic>ClpP</italic> peptidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baker and Sauer, 2012</xref>).

As evolution proceeds in rich medium, we observe a saturation in both run speed and growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), suggesting that further variation is constrained, either genetically or through biophysical constraints on swimming speed. Similarly, in minimal medium, saturation in the growth rate occurs after 5 rounds of selection, suggesting that mutations to further improve growth rate are either not available or fundamental constraints on growth inhibit further increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Scott et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The most striking observation of our study is the divergent trajectories of phenotypic evolution shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–b</xref>. This observation shows that the evolution of faster migration results in environmentally dependent phenotypic outcomes. This result has important implications for interpreting phenotypic variation in natural populations.</p><p>When trade-offs are observed in wild populations, it is sometimes proposed that phenotypes at the extrema of a Pareto frontier reflect the outcome of selection for a specific task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shoval et al., 2012</xref>). Our study shows that when selection pressures place demands on multiple traits simultaneously, evolution along the frontier can reflect differing genetic capacity for adaptation of each phenotype rather than simply the fitness benefit of improving each trait. This result suggests a cautious approach to interpreting phenotypes in nature, where selection pressures and mechanisms constraining phenotypes are often not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gould and Lewontin, 1979</xref>).</p><p>Our results point to the potential predictive power of determining the directions in phenotype space in which genetic variation can most readily change phenotypes – so called, ‘genetic lines of least resistance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schluter, 1996</xref>). These directions may be related to genetic regulatory architecture. The mutations we observe in both rich and minimal media alter negative regulators (a protease in the case of <italic>clpX</italic> and a transcriptional repressor in the case of <italic>galS</italic>). This supports the hypothesis that microevolution is dominated by the disruption of negative regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lind et al., 2015</xref>) and suggests that the direction of phenotypic evolution can be predicted by determining where negative regulatory elements reside in genetic and proteomic networks. The mutations we examined appear to be more subtle than simple loss of function, since knockout mutants for both <italic>clpX</italic> and <italic>galS</italic> do not exhibit fast migration, therefore a detailed understanding of how mutations disrupt negative regulation will be essential.</p><p>Previous experimental evolution studies have revealed a similar trade-off to the one presented here. Comparing the results of these studies to our own demonstrates the impact of how selection is performed on the phenotypic outcomes. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yi and Dean, 2016</xref> selected <italic>E. coli</italic> alternately for growth in well mixed conditions and chemotaxis using a capillary assay and observed a trade-off between growth rate and swimming speed which was circumvented by phenotypic plasticity. We observe no evolution beyond the Pareto frontier in our study, possibly because our conditions simultaneously select for growth and motility rather than alternating between selection pressures. This suggests that evolutionarily persistent trade-offs may reflect selection pressures that occur simultaneously in nature. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van Ditmarsch et al. (2013)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deforet et al. (2014)</xref> select <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> for a hyperswarming phenotype on hard agar. Rather than sampling from the population at a specific location in a swarming colony, they allow the population to swarm for a fixed time interval, remove the entire colony from the plate and inoculate a second plate from a mixed sample of the entire colony. This procedure likely selects both for swarming speed and for growth in the bulk of the colony. Phenotypically, hyperswarmers selected in this way exhibit a decline in growth rate and swimming speed in liquid and a deficit in biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van Ditmarsch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deforet et al., 2014</xref>). In light of our study, these results suggest that evolved phenotypes can depend on whether selection occurs at well defined spatial locations in a structured population (e.g. migrating fronts) or through periodic removal of spatial structure. A more precise understanding of the selection pressure applied by van Ditmarsch <italic>et al.</italic> might emerge from the application of Lande’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lande, 1979</xref>) formalism to the observed genetic and phenotypic variation.</p><p>Interestingly, both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yi and Dean (2016)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van Ditmarsch et al. (2013)</xref> observe mutations that alter regulation of motility and chemotaxis genes. None of the mutations observed in our experiment were found by Yi and Dean, despite evolution along similar Pareto frontiers. This suggests that determining the allowed directions of phenotypic variation may be a more powerful approach to predicting evolution than cataloging mutations alone.</p><p>The mechanism of the trade-off between growth rate and swimming speed has, to our knowledge, not been determined. However, over-expression of motility operons could drive the reductions in growth rate we observe in rich medium. Subsequent increases in speed could then arise passively from reductions in cell size which reduce hydrodynamic drag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Taheri-Araghi et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, increases in growth rate in minimal medium should increase cell size and hydrodynamic drag. Using the data of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Taheri-Araghi et al. (2015)</xref>, we estimated changes in cell size due to measured changes in growth rate for populations evolved in rich and minimal medium. We could not account for the large change in swimming speed we observe through growth rate mediated changes in cell size alone (Appendix 1). Since we have not measured cell size directly, we cannot conclusively rule out this mechanism. To definitively characterize the mechanism of this trade-off will require measurements of cell size, gene expression, flagellar length and proton motive force.</p><p>Our study shows how evolutionary dynamics are defined by the complex interplay between genetic architecture, phenotypic constraints and the environment. Our hope is that a general approach to predicting evolution can emerge from a more complete understanding of this interplay.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Motility selection</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Rich medium</title><p>10 μL of motile <italic>E. coli</italic> (strain MG1655-motile, Coli Genetic Stock Center (CGSC) #8237) from an overnight LB culture was injected at the center of a 0.3 % w/v agar 15 cm diameter plate containing LB.

After 12 hr, 50 μL of cells was removed from each of eight points around the outermost ring.

Remaining bacteria were preserved at −80°C in 25% glycerol. Selection was performed by repeating this sampling and growth over 15 rounds. Automated image processing then yielded quantitative data about front speed. All experiments were performed at 30°C in an environmental chamber (Darwin Chambers, St. Louis, MO). Plates were allowed to equilibrate for 12 hr at 30°C in the environmental chamber before use. All plates for a single selection replicate were poured from a single media bottle. Plates were allowed to cool, parafilmed and stored at 4°C until use.</p><p>To estimate the number of generations that occur during each round of selection, we inoculated an agar plate from a culture of the founding strain. We then measured the cell density of the inoculum by serial dilution and plating. We permitted the colony to expand for 12 hr. To measure the total population on the plate after growth, we mixed the entire contents of the plate in a beaker and measured the density by serial dilution and plating again. From this we extracted an estimate of the number of generations that occurred. The range reflects errors due to serial dilution and plating and the difference in colony size during selection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-2"><title>Minimal medium</title><p>Selection experiment was performed identically to rich medium experiment with the following modifications. Plates were made with M63 0.18 mM galactose. Cultures used to initiate selection were grown in M63 30 mM galactose for 24 to 48 hr prior to initiating selection. During each 48 hr round of migration and imaging, plates were housed in a plexiglass box with a beaker of water to prevent evaporative losses from the plate. Images were acquired every 2 min. We estimated the number of generations per round as described above. Reliable plate counts were only obtained for plates of round 10 strains where we estimate 10 generations per round. We therefore take this as an upper bound and conclude that the 10 round selection experiment includes &lt;100 generations.

A background image was constructed by median projecting six images from the beginning of the acquisition before significant growth had occurred. This image was subtracted from all subsequent images prior to further analysis. The location of the center of the colony was determined by first finding the edges of the colony using a Canny edge detection algorithm. A circular Hough transform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hough, 1959</xref>) was applied to the resulting binary image to locate the center. In rich medium, where signal to background was <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf333"><mml:mrow><mml:mi/><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, radial profiles of image intensity were measured from this center location and were not averaged azimuthally due to small departures from circularity in the colony. The location of the front was determined by finding the outermost peak in radial intensity profiles. Migration rate was determined by linear regression on the front location in time. Imaging was calibrated by imaging a test target to determine the number of pixels per centimeter. The results of the calibration did not depend on the location of the test target in the field of view. In minimal medium, where the signal to background is reduced due to low cell densities, background subtraction was employed as described above but radial density profiles were not always reliable for locating the front. Instead, a circular Hough transform was applied to each image to locate the front at each point in time.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Single-cell tracking</title><p>Single-layer microfluidic devices were constructed from polydimethyl-siloxane (PDMS) using standard soft-lithography techniques, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Quake and Scherer, 2000</xref>) following a design similar to the one used previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jordan et al., 2013</xref>), and were bonded to coverslips by oxygen plasma treatment (Harrick plasma bonder, Harrick Plasma, Ithaca, NY). Bonded devices formed a circular chamber of diameter 200 μm and depth 10 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Devices were soaked in the medium used for tracking (LB for rich medium strains, M63 0.18 mM galactose for minimal medium strains) with 1% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) for at least 1 hr before cells were loaded. Bacteria were inoculated directly from frozen stocks into medium containing 0.1% BSA in a custom continuous culture device. BSA was necessary to minimize cells adhering to the glass cover slip. For rich medium tracking experiments, cells grew to a target optical density and the continuous culture device was run as a turbidostat. In minimal medium experiments the device was run as a chemostat at an optical density of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf334"><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>0.15. The culture was stirred by a magnetic stir bar at 775 RPM and the temperature was maintained at 29.75°C by feedback.</p><p>To perform single-cell tracking, cells were sampled from the continuous-culture device and diluted appropriately (to trap one cell in the chamber at a time) before being pumped into the microfluidic chamber. Video was acquired at 30 frames per second with a Point Grey model FL3-U3-32S2M-CS camera (Point Grey, Richmond, Canada) and a bright-field microscope (Omano OM900-T inverted) at 20x magnification. Movies were recorded for 5 min before a new cell was loaded into the chamber.

Two microscopes were operated in parallel. The stock microscope light source was replaced by a high-brightness white LED (07040-PW740-L, LED Supply, Randolf, VT) to avoid 60 Hz flickering that was observed with the stock halogen light source.

Mutations were confirmed by PCR.

For full details of the recombineering we performed see Appendix 1. Briefly, recombineering proficient cells were prepared by electroporation of the helper plasmid pTKRED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kuhlman and Cox, 2010</xref>) and selection on spectinomycin. A linear ‘landing pad’ fragment consisting of <italic>tetA</italic> flanked by I-SceI restriction sites and homologies to the desired target site was synthesized from the template plasmid pTKLP-<italic>tetA</italic> and site specific primers. The landing pad was inserted by electroporation into recombineering proficient cells and transformants were selected by growth on tetracycline. Successful transformants were confirmed by PCR. A second transformation was then performed using a 70 bp oligo containing the desired mutation near the center and flanked by homologies to target the landing pad. Counterselection for successful transformants was performed with NiCl<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf409"><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> (6 mM for the <italic>ClpX</italic> and <italic>GalS</italic> mutations, 6.5 mM for <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf410"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>1 bp). Successful recombination at this step resulted in removal of the landing pad and integration of the 70 bp oligo containing the desired mutation. The helper plasmid pTKRED was cured by growth at 42°C and confirmed by verifying spectinomycin susceptibility. The presence of desired mutations in the final constructs was confirmed by Sanger sequencing.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to acknowledge Christopher Rao for strains; Yann Chemla, Andrew Ferguson, Hong-yan Shih, Nigel Goldenfeld and faculty members of the Center for the Physics of Living Cells for useful discussions.

evaporative losses in agar plates</title><p>As discussed in Materials and methods, all plates for a single selection experiment were prepared from a single autoclaved bottle of medium and agar (0.3 % w/v). Plates were poured, allowed to cool, parafilmed and stored at 4°C. To initiate a new round of selection, plates were allowed to equilibrate at 30°C for 12 hr (rich medium) or 24 hr (minimal medium) in the environmental chamber prior to inoculation. We performed a series of control experiments by weighing plates to estimate the magnitude of the evaporative water loss due to storage, thermalization and the colony migration assay. For plates stored at 4°C for 9 days and then used in a round of selection we found the total evaporative losses would increase the agar concentration by 5% (e.g. from 0.3 % w/v to 0.315 % w/v). Using the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Croze et al. (2011)</xref>, this corresponds to a change in migration rate of 0.06 cm h<sup>−1</sup>. We take this as an upper bound on the uncertainty in migration rate in the rich medium condition due to uncontrolled variation in the agar concentration due to evaporative losses.</p><p>In minimal medium evaporative losses due to storage are similar to rich mediu but losses during colony expansion are diminished due to saturating humidity over the 48 hr expansion (Materials and methods). We therefore expect the fractional change in agar concentration to be similar between the two experiments. We measured migration rates for the founder strain in soft agar at two concentrations (0.2% and 0.3%) to estimate the change in migration rate as a function of agar concentration. From this we estimate that the error in migration rate due to evaporative losses in the plates during storage and migration are approximately 0.005 cm h<sup>−1</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s21" sec-type="appendix"><title>Additional selection experiments</title><p>We performed selection on the motile but non-chemotactic mutant <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf411"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula><italic>cheA-Z</italic> in the same genetic background used for all other experiments (MG1655-motile). In rich medium, we observed migration an order of magnitude slower than the wild-type and only a small increase in <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf412"><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> over 10 rounds of selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In this experiment each round of selection lasted 24 hr to permit this strain to form colonies large enough for reliable sampling. In minimal medium the non-chemotactic mutant formed no measurable front during 48 hr of incubation and selection, performed by sampling from the periphery of this colony, resulted in only a very small increase in migration rate in one replicate after seven rounds of selection. For the minimal medium experiment, antibiotics were used to limit the possibility of contamination and the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf413"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula><italic>cheA-Z</italic> deletion was confirmed by PCR.</p><p>We performed selection in rich medium where populations were sampled every 12 hr from a point halfway between the center of the colony and the outer edge; results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>. When sampling at this location we observed slower adaptation and a reduction in the maximum rate of expansion compared to populations selected by sampling at the migrating front.</p><p>Since previous work has shown that non-genetic diversity can be important in chemotaxis and front migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frankel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Løvdok et al., 2007</xref>), we asked whether long-term growth in liquid culture resulted in loss of the fast migration phenotype.

PCR using these primers generated the linear landing pad fragment for each desired mutation site.

After 4 hr outgrowth on the bench, half the culture was pelleted in a microcentrifuge (1 min, 14000 RPM). 410 μL of the supernatant was removed, cells were resuspended in the remaining media and plated on LB+tetracycline+spectinomycin plates. The remaining half of the culture was plated in the same way after an additional day of outgrowth on the bench. The plates were grown at 30°C and colonies typically took a few days to appear at this step. PCR and 1% agarose gel electrophoresis on resultant colonies was used to confirm successful landing pad integration at the desired site. The presence of a secondary band consistent with the wild-type revealed heterogeneity within transformant colonies.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Diethard Tautz (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision. Given the additional extensive revisions that the reviewers argue must be accomplished, we feel that we must reject the current submission. Under the circumstances, we would understand if you now chose to submit this work elsewhere.

The experiment was done through selecting for edge (faster-migrating) cells migrating through low-percentage agar. Given that it has been known for a long time that shorter run durations are advantageous in a porous environment (Migration of bacteria in semisolid agar. A J Wolfe and H C Berg.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 1989 vol. 86 (18) pp. 6973-6977), the conclusions are not surprising. Thus, we would like you to put less emphasis on this less novel aspect and acknowledge so (e.g. explicitly stating that the result is as expected). Reduction in cell-to-cell variability is potentially interesting, but we are not sure whether this is a direct consequence of faster motility. Moreover, the significance of this result seems to depend on the dataset that the observations came from (see reviewer 3 comments below).</p><p>While the authors identified some candidate mutations to explain the observed changes in behavior, they did not test any of them in an ancestral background. Thus, we don't know which mutations were necessary for the altered phenotypes. It would be very interesting to know, for example, whether one mutation was sufficient to reduce variance in the population, while another was sufficient to reduce run duration, etc. This kind of analysis would provide an obvious step forward because it would provide an understanding of how motility can be rapidly altered by selective pressures at the molecular/genetic level.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>1) Does the evolution of faster motility require a porous environment? If you propagate <italic>E. coli</italic> in a well-mixed environment (e.g. in a chemostat selecting for faster growth), will you see faster motility as a byproduct of faster growth (mutations can be pleiotropic)? More critically, if you inject <italic>E. coli</italic> in the middle of a static broth environment (no agar) and select for cells at the peripheral for &gt;50 generations, do you expect to see faster motility? If you see faster motility, will cells not show shorter runs?</p><p>2) The authors need to do a better job characterizing growth phenotypes, especially since <italic>E. coli</italic> experience a range of growth conditions in a spatially-structured environment. I suspect that the observation that Gen 15 evolved cells show slower growth rate than ancestral cells in abundant nutrients is linked to the possibility that they may grow better than ancestral cells in limited nutrients. This kind of fitness tradeoff has been seen in many systems. You can do a chemostat competition experiment to test this. Thus, evolved cells may &quot;beat&quot; ancestors in two ways: they can arrive at abundant LB first, so their slower growth in abundant LB will not make much difference; and they can also grow better than the ancestor when stuck at the inner region. This may help explain how quickly they come to fixation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>1) I particularly like the approach taken by the authors to measure single-cell swimming behavior, but wonder how the authors keep track of cells if they move out of focus. Do the authors focus on cells near glass surface? In that case cell-surface interaction will cause cells to swim in circles and suppress tumbling, which may obscure the results.</p><p>2) The authors identify tumbles based on angular velocity, &quot;Tumbles were initiated whenever ω(t) &gt; 6 rad s<sup>−1</sup> and continued until ω(t) &lt; 3.9 rad s<sup>−1</sup>. These two thresholds on ω were determined by eye and resulted in average run and tumble durations in accordance with previously published values.&quot; This criterion is different from that used in some other publications, such as Berg and Brown, 1972, where tumbles were identified by both abrupt change of velocity direction and reduction of speed (due to complete or partial loss of propulsive force when flagellar bundle disassembles). The authors obtained a mean run time of 0.42 ± 0.005 s for WT cells, almost half as much as that obtained in Berg and Brown, 1972 (0.86 s) for AW405 cells swimming in bulk fluids. I suppose this two-fold difference in run time could not be attributed to strain difference, but most likely due to the difference in definition of tumbles.</p><p>3) RP437 and AW405 strains were selected for spreading and chemotaxis capability in swimming agar plates from <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 strain. Do RP437 or AW405 behave similarly to the evolved strains in the paper (i.e. executing runs with faster speeds but with reduced duration compared to MG1655)?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>1) In general, I enjoyed the writing style and the attention to detail in the manuscript. In particular, the experiments were solid and the controls were thorough, especially for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. However, I have trouble understanding why the authors did not propagate all lines to 15 rounds since it only involves doing 5 more plates for each line. This is especially important since a lot of subsequent analysis is carried out using the &quot;evolved strain&quot; that harvested from that single line of evolution after 15 rounds. Having more lines would also indicate whether or not the reduction in diversity is a general feature.</p><p>2) The modeling provides nice qualitative support to the findings about the relationship between front speed and geometry and the cells parameters but maybe takes too much place in the paper since many of the parameters were poorly constrained or taken from experiments done on other strains in different conditions. The authors are up front about this, and do a good job explaining the model, but it seems that the model is just used to say that the observed changes are probably not due to changes in growth (which they show experimentally anyway), and that there are probably other factors not accounted for in the model that are responsible for improved performance. Space could be used instead for addressing concerns mentioned above.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.the profile of intensity appears to get gradually lower from the center, and then abruptly lower to form the outer ring. I don't see how this can be compared to the simulated profile, which appears to gradually increase in intensity from the center, before forming an abruptly higher intensity ring. Is this why the profiles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>—figure – supplement 1A and D look so different from one another? Can you account for these differences? Is it due to uneven illumination in the experiment? Did the authors use an inverse scaling for the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> (dark is more cells rather than light is more cells)?</p><p>4) In the Results, the authors say that &quot;the increase in s was reproducible across independent selection experiments&quot;, but it is hard to tell without showing the trajectory of each experiment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> shows that on average, s increased. This is especially interesting because in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, the round where one experiment is missing has a much smaller error bar than the other rounds. This suggests that one of the experiments was quite different from the others. Was the missing observation from the experimental replicate that had a different mutational trajectory?</p><p>5) Since tracks were cut when cells interacted with the boundary, how where the runs that were not terminated on both ends by tumbles treated (or tumbles that were not terminated on both ends by runs)? These runs (tumbles) would be of undefined length. Was the data analyzed without these undefined events?</p><p>6) Variance in the S dataset is in general greater than it is for the L dataset. The authors explain that this is due to sampling fewer run-tumble events for each individual in the S dataset. From the description, S individuals were observed for ~5 min, while L individuals were observed for ~10 min. However, there were at least 6x more individuals in S. Could the larger population size account for the increased variance? In general to assess cell-to-cell variability one should measure many cells rather than a few cells for a very long time. On a related note, the reduction in variance seems to be only significant (according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E-H</xref> for one of the two datasets in two of the three measured parameters for which a reduction in variance is claimed (S for run speed, L for run time). Ideally, the significance of the reduction should not depend on the dataset.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Environment determines evolutionary trajectory in a constrained phenotypic space&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Diethard Tautz (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Wenying Shou (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Yilin Wu (Reviewer #2), and Thierry Emonet and Adam Waite (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Fraebel et al. selected <italic>E. coli</italic> for faster migration through porous environment (low% agarose) in rich or minimal medium. Their qualitative mathematical model predicted that faster growth rate and faster run speed during chemotaxis are the most important elements in achieving faster migration through agar. They observed an evolutionary tradeoff between run speed and growth rate. In rich medium, mutations leading to improved run speed at the cost of slower growth are selected, whereas in minimal medium, mutations leading to improved growth rate at the cost of slower run speed are selected. Single mutations display these tradeoffs, suggesting antagonistic pleiotropy. Their mathematical model suggests that in rich versus minimal medium, the relative variances of the two phenotypes (growth rate and run speed) differ, which causes different evolutionary trajectories.</p><p>We all feel that the work is solid and interesting. However, we all feel that your narratives can be modified to achieve a greater level of clarity, especially regarding model-experiment comparison. We are all aware of the difficulty in modeling biological systems (especially dynamics of biological systems). Thus, a lack of great fit is not too surprising, but we do expect well thought-through explanations or even speculations on what your model explains or fails to explain.</p><p>Thus, we invite you to revise your writing in accordance with our suggestions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Although tradeoff between run speed and growth rate has been observed before, I do like the contrast between different outcomes in different environments. Overall, I find the paper solid and interesting. However, their narratives can be modified to achieve a greater level of clarity. I list a few examples below.</p><p>1) Authors claimed that in both rich and minimal media, their five lines evolved similarly. I am not sure that I agree with their assessment, although without error bars in graphs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), it is tough to tell one way or another. I suggest authors add error bars (or an estimation of errors). Authors could also simply write something like &quot;migration rates increased in all lines, though the extent of improvement differed along lines&quot;.</p><p>2) In some lines, despite selection, migration rate seemed to decline at later stages. Is that caused by genetic drift, as described by for example &quot;Genetic drift at expanding frontiers promotes gene segregation&quot; by Hallatschek et al.? This is a striking feature of the graph, and in my opinion, should be touched upon even if briefly.</p><p>3) You often claimed that your model qualitatively captured experiments (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). I am not sure which qualities you are referring to, especially with respect to rich medium experiments. The agreement is pretty poor in my opinion, unless I am missing something.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript aims to address how constraints on phenotypic variation may limit the capacity of organisms to adapt to the multiple selection pressures, using <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> colony expansion in a porous environment as a model system. The authors found that a trade-off between swimming speed and growth rate that depends on the environment (rich medium versus minimal medium, in this case). They further showed that the trade-off is mediated by antagonistic pleiotropy through mutations that affect negative regulation. The paper is well-written and the results are clearly presented.</p><p>Evolutionary dynamics under multiple selection pressures have been investigated by a number of studies, some of which were cited in the manuscript. The main novelty of this paper, as the authors pointed out, is in that the selection process here involves multiple stresses simultaneously. In this regard, I hope the following point could be clarified: By selecting populations at migration front, one clearly imposes selection pressure on migration rate; but it is less clear to me whether a selection pressure on growth rate exists. Having a higher or lower growth rate does not necessarily guarantee whether a subpopulation can reach the edge, or for the specific population at colony edge, growth rate and migration rate could be uncoupled. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> colony spreading through soft agar indeed depends on both motility and growth, but this is at the level of entire colony. Another way to impose selection pressures simultaneously on growth rate and migration rate would be: (a) grow many plates in parallel; (b) select the plate with largest colony size; (c) pool all cells on that plate for next round of propagation and selection. (Reviewing editor's comments: you can discuss that in Discussions).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The authors have done a good job addressing my concerns from their initial submission. They have made an initially strong and interesting paper even stronger and more interesting. I am especially impressed by the thoroughness of their controls.</p><p>In general I find the comparison between model and data to be difficult to follow throughout the paper. I found myself repeatedly lost jumping between main figures and sup figures. The end result is that I had the impression that the model was vaguely useful. I think authors could do a better job at clearly explaining what the model does and does not explain.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24669.044</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>Summary:</italic> </p><p><italic>&quot;Evolution of bacterial motility through a porous environment&quot; suggests that bacteria can evolve faster motility in a porous environment by executing shorter runs (avoiding collision with agar), swimming faster, and reducing cell-to-cell variability (the evolved populations had a lower growth rate than the ancestor population).

Thus, we don't know which mutations were necessary for the altered phenotypes. It would be very interesting to know, for example, whether one mutation was sufficient to reduce variance in the population, while another was sufficient to reduce run duration, etc. This kind of analysis would provide an obvious step forward because it would provide an understanding of how motility can be rapidly altered by selective pressures at the molecular/genetic level.</italic> </p><p>We have studied the phenotypes of mutations in the ancestral background for both rich medium and minimal medium conditions. Using scarless recombineering, we engineered point mutations in <italic>clpX</italic> and <italic>galS</italic> as well as an intergenic single base pair deletion. We have also studied the phenotypes of knockout mutants for <italic>clpX</italic> and <italic>galS.</italic> With respect to the speculation that different mutations might be responsible for changes in run speed and reduction in variability: we observe an increase in run speed for the <italic>clpXE185*</italic> mutant concurrently with a decline in individuality in rich medium (data not shown for individuality). We concluded that these traits do not appear to be under independent genetic control.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Does the evolution of faster motility require a porous environment? If you propagate E. coli in a well-mixed environment (e.g. in a chemostat selecting for faster growth), will you see faster motility as a byproduct of faster growth (mutations can be pleiotropic)?</italic> </p><p>To test this possibility, we inoculated the founding strain in a turbidostat and continuously cultured it for 200 generations in rich medium while periodically testing the front migration rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We find that long-term growth in well-mixed liquid does not result in a large increase in front migration rate (~3% vs. ~100% for selection in low-viscosity agar). We performed an analagous experiment in minimal medium, where we continuously cultured cells for 100 generations (22 days) in minimal medium. In this case we did observe a substantial increase in the rate of migration in low-viscosity agar, but the increase was smaller than what we observe due to selection in plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>More critically, if you inject E. coli in the middle of a static broth environment (no agar) and select for cells at the peripheral for &gt;50 generations, do you expect to see faster motility? If you see faster motility, will cells not show shorter runs?</italic> </p><p>Testing the expansion of populations in pure liquid is very challenging since in the presence of even very small thermal gradients (which are exceedingly hard to suppress on centimeter length scales), transport will be dominated by convective flow. Therefore, we have not performed this experiment. We regard the question of how environmental structure (gel concentration) alters evolution to be an interesting question which is outside the scope of the current study.</p><p><italic>2) The authors need to do a better job characterizing growth phenotypes, especially since E. coli experience a range of growth conditions in a spatially-structured environment. I suspect that the observation that Gen 15 evolved cells show slower growth rate than ancestral cells in abundant nutrients is linked to the possibility that they may grow better than ancestral cells in limited nutrients. This kind of fitness tradeoff has been seen in many systems. You can do a chemostat competition experiment to test this. Thus, evolved cells may &quot;beat&quot; ancestors in two ways: they can arrive at abundant LB first, so their slower growth in abundant LB will not make much difference; and they can also grow better than the ancestor when stuck at the inner region. This may help explain how quickly they come to fixation.</italic> </p><p>We have performed additional growth rate measurements of the founding strain and strains isolated from 5, 10 and 15 rounds of selection. To test the possibility that the evolved strains grows more quickly in nutrient limited conditions, we made growth rate measurements in diluted LB (10-fold and 100-fold dilutions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 2</xref>). We find that the founder strain has a higher growth rate even under nutrient limited conditions. While we recognize that this is not a direct competition experiment, the growth rate difference is very large (30-50%).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24669.040</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Growth rates of rich medium evolved strains under nutrient limitation.</title><p>(left) is data reproduced from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> of the main text.

Do the authors focus on cells near glass surface? In that case cell-surface interaction will cause cells to swim in circles and suppress tumbling, which may obscure the results.</italic> </p><p>We focus in between the PDMS and glass surface and neglect motion of the cells into and out of the focal plane – tracking behavior in 2-dimensions. With respect to circling due to interactions with the floor and ceiling of the chamber: we note that several previous studies have used a similar geometry to our and observed wild-type run-tumble statistics (e.g. Umehara et al.Biophysical Journal, 2008). However, we do observe transient circling in some cell isolated in our chambers. To check that this was not altering our results, we devised a quantitative method to detect circling in our single-cell trajectories (described in Supplementary file 1). When we remove individuals that exhibit some circling by this metric, we find that our conclusions are not altered.</p><p><italic>2) The authors identify tumbles based on angular velocity, &quot;Tumbles were initiated whenever ω(t) &gt; 6 rad s<sup>−1</sup> and continued until ω(t) &lt; 3.9 rad s<sup>−1</sup>. These two thresholds on ω were determined by eye and resulted in average run and tumble durations in accordance with previously published values.&quot; This criterion is different from that used in some other publications, such as Berg and Brown, 1972, where tumbles were identified by both abrupt change of velocity direction and reduction of speed (due to complete or partial loss of propulsive force when flagellar bundle disassembles). The authors obtained a mean run time of 0.42 ± 0.005 s for WT cells, almost half as much as that obtained in Berg and Brown, 1972 (0.86 s) for AW405 cells swimming in bulk fluids. I suppose this two-fold difference in run time could not be attributed to strain difference, but most likely due to the difference in definition of tumbles.</italic> </p><p>To address this, we have implemented a different run-tumble detector based on a recent paper (Taute, Gude, Tans &amp; Shimizu, Nat. Comm. 2015) which is based on a previous technique due to Berg and Brown (1972). The details of our implementation of this method are discussed in the Methods of the main text. We find this approach returns longer average run durations (0.5 – 0.7s) for our data. This detector is especially appropriate for our study because it readily accommodates cells with variable run speeds. We thank the reviewer for pointing this out.</p><p><italic>3) RP437 and AW405 strains were selected for spreading and chemotaxis capability in swimming agar plates from E. coli K-12 strain. Do RP437 or AW405 behave similarly to the evolved strains in the paper (i.e. executing runs with faster speeds but with reduced duration compared to MG1655)?</italic> </p><p>To answer this question, we performed front migration, growth rate and single-cell tracking measurements on RP437. We found that this strain had nearly identical run-tumble statistics to our founder strain (MG1655-motile, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), a lower growth rate and a nearly two-fold lower rate of migration relative to founder. We conclude that our round 15 evolved strain is phenotypically distinct from the wild-type for chemotaxis laboratory strain RP437.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) In general, I enjoyed the writing style and the attention to detail in the manuscript. In particular, the experiments were solid and the controls were thorough, especially for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. However, I have trouble understanding why the authors did not propagate all lines to 15 rounds since it only involves doing 5 more plates for each line. This is especially important since a lot of subsequent analysis is carried out using the &quot;evolved strain&quot; that harvested from that single line of evolution after 15 rounds. Having more lines would also indicate whether or not the reduction in diversity is a general feature.</italic> </p><p>We have addressed this concern in two ways. (1) we have performed an additional set of four fully independent selection experiments out to 15 rounds. (2) We have performed single-cell tracking on intermediate rounds of selection (5 and 10) as well as on three independently evolved round 15 strains. For selection in the minimal medium environment we have performed five replicate selection experiments as well, sequencing intermediate strains and performing tracking on independently evolved round 10 strains.</p><p><italic>2) The modeling provides nice qualitative support to the findings about the relationship between front speed and geometry and the cells parameters but maybe takes too much place in the paper since many of the parameters were poorly constrained or taken from experiments done on other strains in different conditions. The authors are up front about this, and do a good job explaining the model, but it seems that the model is just used to say that the observed changes are probably not due to changes in growth (which they show experimentally anyway), and that there are probably other factors not accounted for in the model that are responsible for improved performance. Space could be used instead for addressing concerns mentioned above.</italic> </p><p>Since the model now plays an important role in pointing out that the phenotypic trade-off we observe constrains the evolution of faster migration, we feel it is important to include a somewhat detailed discussion. We have made every effort to make the model accessible, reduce the length of the description of the model and have included a table in the main text describing each parameter.</p><p><italic>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> the profile of intensity appears to get gradually lower from the center, and then abruptly lower to form the outer ring. I don't see how this can be compared to the simulated profile, which appears to gradually increase in intensity from the center, before forming an abruptly higher intensity ring. Is this why the profiles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A and D</xref> look so different from one another? Can you account for these differences? Is it due to uneven illumination in the experiment? Did the authors use an inverse scaling for the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> (dark is more cells rather than light is more cells)?</italic> </p><p>The outer ring is formed by migration towards serine and the secondary ring by migration towards aspartic acid. In the founder strain, the second ring is higher density and close to this outer ring and this results in the profile mentioned by the reviewer. The model includes only a <italic>single</italic> nutrient source (serine) and neglects the secondary ring formed by chemotaxis towards aspartic acid entirely. This accounts for the difference between the experimental and simulated front profiles. We have added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> to show the front profile for the founder strain more clearly. In all figures showing colonies, darker areas correspond to more cells.</p><p><italic>4) In the Results, the authors say that &quot;the increase in s was reproducible across independent selection experiments&quot;, but it is hard to tell without showing the trajectory of each experiment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> shows that on average, s increased. This is especially interesting because in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, the round where one experiment is missing has a much smaller error bar than the other rounds. This suggests that one of the experiments was quite different from the others. Was the missing observation from the experimental replicate that had a different mutational trajectory?</italic> </p><p>To clarify the presentation of the data we have plotted each selection experiment as a separate line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,E</xref>. We have included the four new 15-round selection experiments. This presentation substantially clarifies the interpretation of the data. For clarity, we have omitted the previously performed experiments that were only carried out to 10 rounds in rich medium. For these strains we performed sequencing and found very similar mutational trajectories to what we observed in the new 15-round experiments.</p><p><italic>5) Since tracks were cut when cells interacted with the boundary, how where the runs that were not terminated on both ends by tumbles treated (or tumbles that were not terminated on both ends by runs)? These runs (tumbles) would be of undefined length. Was the data analyzed without these undefined events?</italic> </p><p>The data was analyzed without these undefined events. Run events that resulted in interaction with the chamber boundary were not included in the distributions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> or any of the supplementary figures.</p><p><italic>6) Variance in the S dataset is in general greater than it is for the L dataset. The authors explain that this is due to sampling fewer run-tumble events for each individual in the S dataset. From the description, S individuals were observed for ~5 min, while L individuals were observed for ~10 min. However, there were at least 6x more individuals in S. Could the larger population size account for the increased variance? In general to assess cell-to-cell variability one should measure many cells rather than a few cells for a very long time. On a related note, the reduction in variance seems to be only significant (according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E-H</xref> for one of the two datasets in two of the three measured parameters for which a reduction in variance is claimed (S for run speed, L for run time). Ideally, the significance of the reduction should not depend on the dataset.</italic> </p><p>First, to better test for changes in individuality we performed single-cell tracking of ~100 individuals from strains isolated after 5,10 and (3 independent isolates) 15 rounds. From these data we observe unambiguous reduction in cell to cell variability (For example, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref>). As stated above, since the change in individuality is no longer a focus of the present study we have omitted these results from the manuscript under consideration.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>[…] Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>Although tradeoff between run speed and growth rate has been observed before, I do like the contrast between different outcomes in different environments. Overall, I find the paper solid and interesting. However, their narratives can be modified to achieve a greater level of clarity. I list a few examples below.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Authors claimed that in both rich and minimal media, their five lines evolved similarly. I am not sure that I agree with their assessment, although without error bars in graphs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), it is tough to tell one way or another. I suggest authors add error bars (or an estimation of errors). Authors could also simply write something like &quot;migration rates increased in all lines, though the extent of improvement differed along lines&quot;.</italic> </p><p>We do not include error bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,E</xref> since the error of the regression used to determine front migration rate are smaller than the size of the markers. We have clarified this in the caption to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>To further emphasize that the increase in migration rate varies between replicates we have added the statement “So, while migration rates increased in all replicates, the magnitude of the increase differed between replicates.” to the end of paragraph 3 in the section “Experimental evolution of migration rate”.To address this issue in the minimal medium experiment we have added the statement “So while all replicates increased their migration rate, the magnitude of the increase in migration rate varied substantially.” to paragraph 6 of the aforementioned section.</p><p><italic>2) In some lines, despite selection, migration rate seemed to decline at later stages. Is that caused by genetic drift, as described by for example &quot;Genetic drift at expanding frontiers promotes gene segregation&quot; by Hallatschek et al.? This is a striking feature of the graph, and in my opinion, should be touched upon even if briefly.</italic> </p><p>A substantial fraction of the observed fluctuations in migration rates is due to uncontrolled variation in the agar concentration of the plates. This variation arises from variation in liquid loss during autoclaving and from evaporation after plates are prepared. We have taken every measure to minimize these effects (autoclaving in large bottles, para-filming plates, storing plates at 4°C prior to use). We have added these details to the Methods: “Motility Selection”.By weighing plates we estimated the magnitude of the change in agar concentration due to evaporative loss. These experiments and previous measurements of the migration rate as a function of agar concentration (Croze <italic>et al.</italic> 2011, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>)) we expect evaporative losses can account for a change in migration rate in rich media of at most 0.06 cm/h. We have added these estimates to Supplementary file 1.</p><p>Therefore, only differences greater than approximately 0.06 cm/h in the rich medium experiment can be interpreted as being significant. For example, replicates 3 and 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) have significantly faster rates of migration than other replicates in round 7. Further, the decline in migration rate in replicate 4 at round 14 and 15 is significant. These differences may reflect the distinct mutations arising in replicate experiments as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. To address this we have added the following language to the end of paragraph 3 of “Experimental evolution of migration rate”:</p><p>“We estimate that plate-to-plate variation in agar concentration due to evaporative loss could change the migration rate by up to 0.06 cm/h in later rounds (Supplementary file 1). […] So, while migration rates increased in all replicates, the magnitude of the increase differed between replicates.”</p><p>For minimal medium conditions we have included similar estimates of the role of evaporation in changing migration rate to Supplementary file 1. We find that evaporative losses can account for about 10% variation in migration rates. Since the replicate to replicate migration exceeds this estimate we have added the following statement to paragraph 6 of “Experimental evolution of migration rate”:</p><p>“We observed an approximately 3-fold increase in s over the course of 10 rounds of selection. […] This variation may be due to the different mutations present across replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).”</p><p>For clarity we have moved the sentence “Populations formed small ~1.5cm diameter colonies […]” that was previously at the end of this paragraph to the third sentence.</p><p>Four lines of evidence suggest that the variation in migration rates we observe cannot be accounted for by neutral variation as described in Hallatschek et al. (PNAS, 2007). First, Hallatschek et al.describe spatially segregated <italic>neutral</italic> diversity in expanding colonies on hard agar plates. This diversity does not confer a fitness advantage or disadvantage in the colony expansion process (as observed through competition experiments and colony morphology). Second, we sample from 8 locations around the periphery of the colony after each round of expansion and mix these samples prior to inoculating the next round. Therefore, spatially segregated diversity is destroyed after each round of selection. We have emphasized this by adding “After a fixed period of incubation samples are taken from 8 locations around the outer edge of the expanded colony, mixed, and used to inoculate a fresh plate.” to the caption for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Third, we transfer a relatively large population (10<sup>6</sup> cells) from one round to the next which limits genetic drift. Finally, while there is variation in the identity of mutations we observe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), repeated mutations at identical nucleotides (<italic>clpX</italic>E185*) or genes (<italic>galS</italic>) suggest that selection is stronger than drift in our experiment.</p><p><italic>3) You often claimed that your model qualitatively captured experiments (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). I am not sure which qualities you are referring to, especially with respect to rich medium experiments. The agreement is pretty poor in my opinion, unless I am missing something.</italic> </p><p>To more clearly describe the limitations of our model, and to clarify why the model predictions do not entirely recapitulate the colony expansion in rich medium in particular, we have added paragraph 4 to the section “Increasing swimming speed and growth rate increase migration rate”, which reads:</p><p>In rich medium our model describes the dynamics of a single metabolite/attractant (L-serine), and therefore fails to account for secondary fronts behind the outermost front, which arise from the metabolism of other amino acids (Adler, 1966)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). […] While more sophisticated models have been developed to include these processes (Vladimirov et al.2008,Frankel et al. 2014), the model in (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1 equ2">Equations 1, 2</xref>) captures the essential features of bacterial front migration with fewer adjustable parameters. See the Supplementary file 1 for further discussion.</p><p>We have added a brief statement to the end of paragraph 2 in section “Experimental evolution of migration rate<bold>”</bold> to clarify that in minimal medium we observe only a single migrating front “Second, we used minimal medium (M63, 0.18mM galactose, 0.3% w/v agar, 30C) where populations migrate towards and metabolize galactose <italic>with a single migrating front.</italic>”</p><p>We have clarified the interpretation of the parameters in the reaction-diffusion model by adding “k<sub>0</sub> is the chemotactic coefficient, which captures the strength of chemotaxis in response to gradients in attractant.” To the first paragraph of the “Increasing swimming speed and growth rate increase migration rate” section.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] Evolutionary dynamics under multiple selection pressures have been investigated by a number of studies, some of which were cited in the manuscript. The main novelty of this paper, as the authors pointed out, is in that the selection process here involves multiple stresses simultaneously. In this regard, I hope the following point could be clarified: By selecting populations at migration front, one clearly imposes selection pressure on migration rate; but it is less clear to me whether a selection pressure on growth rate exists. Having a higher or lower growth rate does not necessarily guarantee whether a subpopulation can reach the edge, or for the specific population at colony edge, growth rate and migration rate could be uncoupled. Escherichia coli colony spreading through soft agar indeed depends on both motility and growth, but this is at the level of entire colony.</italic> </p><p>We argue that selection for faster migration also selects for faster growth. Growth results from nutrient consumption which creates a spatial gradient in nutrients (attractants) which then drives chemotaxis, migration and further growth. The coupling between growth and migration is precisely the reason that our model predicts a substantial increase in migration rate with growth rate in both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). So our numerical simulations support this claim.</p><p>To further support this claim we point the reviewer to work by D.A. Koster et al.(J. Mol. Biol. 2012, 424 180-191). The authors study migrating fronts of <italic>E. coli</italic> in low viscosity agar and show that cells in the migrating front can be modeled as a population in a chemostat. Fresh nutrients are provided by front migration while cells which lag behind the migrating front reside in low nutrient conditions and are “washed out” of the front. Cells that fail to grow at the front, or that grow at a reduced rate, will be outcompeted exponentially fast. Therefore, as our own model concludes, selection for migration rate also selects for growth rate.</p><p>Finally, our data also suggest a relationship between growth rate and migration rate. For the RP437 strain we measure nearly identical swimming properties as compared to MG1655-motile (run speed and duration; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, RP437 exhibits a growth rate which is approximately 10% lower than MG1655-motile and a migration rate in rich medium a factor of two lower than MG1655-motile. The slower migration rate, we postulate, results from the slower growth rate in this strain. We have added the migration rate and growth rate in rich medium for RP437 to the caption to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p>To further clarify the dual roles of growth and motility to the migration process we have added the following sentence to the first paragraph of the section “Experimental evolution of migration rate”. <italic>“</italic>As a result, the outermost edge of the expanding colony is driven by both growth and motility (Koster et al. 2012).”</p><p><italic>Another way to impose selection pressures simultaneously on growth rate and migration rate would be: (a) grow many plates in parallel; (b) select the plate with largest colony size; (c) pool all cells on that plate for next round of propagation and selection. (Reviewing editor's comments: you can discuss that in Discussions).</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the precise method of selection is important for interpreting results. We also agree that adding a discussion of this makes an important improvement to our manuscript. As we outline above, our method of selecting cells from the migrating front selects for both motility and growth rate. However, previous studies have invoked selection methods similar to those outlined by reviewer #2 (e.g. van Ditmarsch et al. 2013). To address the role of the selection procedure in the phenotypic outcome, we have modified paragraph 4 of the Discussion section as follows:</p><p>“Previous experimental evolution studies have revealed similar trade-offs to those presented here. […] A more precise understanding of the selection pressure applied by van Ditmarsch et al. might emerge from the application of Lande's (Lande, 1979) formalism to the observed genetic and phenotypic variation.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
