A subset of lincRNAs enriched in developing brains have recently been found to contain cryptic open-reading frames and are speculated to encode micropeptides. However, systematic identification and functional assessment of these transcripts have been hindered by technical challenges caused by their small size. Here, we show that two putative lincRNAs (<italic>linc-mipep,</italic> also called <italic>lnc-rps25,</italic> and <italic>linc-wrb</italic>) encode micropeptides with homology to the vertebrate-specific chromatin architectural protein, Hmgn1, and demonstrate that they are required for development of vertebrate-specific brain cell types. Specifically, we show that NMDA receptor-mediated pathways are dysregulated in zebrafish lacking these micropeptides and that their loss preferentially alters the gene regulatory networks that establish cerebellar cells and oligodendrocytes – evolutionarily newer cell types that develop postnatally in humans. These findings reveal a key missing link in the evolution of vertebrate brain cell development and illustrate a genetic basis for how some neural cell types are more susceptible to chromatin disruptions, with implications for neurodevelopmental disorders and disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>micropeptides</kwd><kwd>neurodevelopment</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>single cell analyses</kwd><kwd>cell identity</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99HD105001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tornini</surname><given-names>Valerie A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006792</institution-id><institution>Hartwell Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tornini</surname><given-names>Valerie A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>217150/Z/19/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rihel</surname><given-names>Jason</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014370</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giraldez</surname><given-names>Antonio J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH118554</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giraldez</surname><given-names>Antonio J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD100035</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giraldez</surname><given-names>Antonio J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Much of the remaining transcriptome is comprised of non-coding RNAs, including thousands of predicted long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs). Despite this large number of lincRNAs, the functional significance of most remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goudarzi et al., 2019</xref>). Recent advances in ribosome profiling and mass spectrometry have identified short open-reading frames (sORFs) within putative lincRNA sequences that may encode micropeptides, which were otherwise missed due to their small size (&lt;100 aa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazzini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kondo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pauli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Couso and Patraquim, 2017</xref>). Despite conventional rules assuming that short peptides are unlikely to fold into stable structures to perform functions and subjective cut-offs (100 aa) used in computational identification of protein coding genes, there are several examples of these small peptides performing diverse, important cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">D’Lima et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fields et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Many lincRNAs are expressed in a tissue-specific manner, and about 40% of all long noncoding RNAs identified in the human genome are specifically expressed in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Derrien et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ulitsky et al., 2011</xref>). The vertebrate central nervous system consists of some of the most diverse and specialized cell types in the vertebrate body and has distinct chromatin states and gene regulatory networks that have evolved to establish and maintain this diversity. Since many micropeptides have a relatively recent evolutionarily origin and, given their small size, may be able to access and regulate cellular machines inaccessible by larger proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Makarewich and Olson, 2017</xref>), the lincRNA tissue-specificity may indicate undiscovered roles in vertebrate-specific CNS development and function.</p><p>Evolutionarily recent micropeptides may contribute to vertebrate-specific functions and phenotypes that have otherwise been missed due to misclassification as non-coding transcripts and lack of high-throughput phenotyping for coding functions. We sought to identify micropeptides that were cryptically encoded in long non-coding RNAs but were missed due to assumptions about minimal protein sizes, dubious homologies, or mis-annotations. Here, we interrogate the function of predicted non-coding RNAs and identify two related micropeptides that regulate behavior, chromatin accessibility, and gene regulatory networks that establish evolutionarily newer neural cell types.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Screen of long non-coding RNAs identifies micropeptide regulators of vertebrate behavior</title><p>To identify lincRNAs that may encode for micropeptides, we first analyzed ribosome profiles for previously published lincRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ulitsky et al., 2011</xref> in zebrafish embryos during early development (0–48 hr post-fertilization) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazzini et al., 2014</xref>), performed in situ hybridization on 21 of these candidates, and identified brain-enriched micropeptide candidates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

While both <italic>linc-mipep</italic> and <italic>linc-wrb</italic> were originally identified as long non-coding RNAs, both genes have ribosome-protected fragments, suggesting they are likely encoding proteins 87aa and 93aa in size, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5D, E</xref>).

Thus, to distinguish whether <italic>linc-mipep</italic> and <italic>linc-wrb</italic> function as regulatory DNA, noncoding RNA, or protein coding genes, we used CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to generate stable deletion mutants that either target the full sequence, the translation start site, the putative coding region, or the conserved untranslated/non-coding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref> ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>).

To identify the evolutionary origin of this gene, we traced back the synteny for sequences or expressed sequence tags (ESTs) that were identified between flanking genes that are syntenically conserved with humans, <italic>Get1/Wrb</italic> and <italic>Brwd1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5E</xref>). Through these analyses, we were first able to identify an unannotated ORF in the basal agnathan (jawless vertebrate) lamprey, syntenic to human HMGN1, that encodes for an ancestral protein more similar to human HMGN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3E</xref>). Though we did not identify any <italic>linc-mipep</italic> or <italic>linc-wrb</italic> protein-coding homolog in invertebrates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), in line with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Johns, 1982</xref>), we did identify an ORF syntenic to <italic>linc-wrb</italic> in the invertebrate basal chordate lancelet (or amphioxus) genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A</xref>). When we analyzed whether there were any similarities between the sequence of this APEX1-like gene in the lancelet genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A</xref>), we found by BLAST that its N-terminal sequence (30aa) aligns to HMGN family members in various vertebrate species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D</xref>). These results suggest that the N-terminal sequence of the gene in the ancestral location that would give rise to <italic>linc-wrb</italic> and human HMGN1 may have been co-opted to give rise to the HMGN gene and pseudogene families in vertebrates.</p><p>We next searched for the evolutionary origins of <italic>linc-mipep</italic>. The highly conserved 3’UTR suggested that <italic>linc-mipep</italic> and <italic>linc-wrb</italic> derived from the same ancestral gene, either before or after the teleost-specific genome duplication. To address this question, we analyzed the regions syntenic to human HMGN1 in spotted gar, a slowly evolving species whose lineage diverged from teleosts before the teleost genome duplication, and in coelacanth, a lobe-finned fish with the slowest evolving bony vertebrate genome that split from ray-finned fish such as gar and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braasch et al., 2016</xref>). In coelacanth, we only identified one protein sequence that aligns to HMGN1, syntenic to human HMGN1, with no ESTs or other sequences identified elsewhere (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). In spotted gar, we found the gene syntenic to <italic>linc-wrb</italic> and human <italic>Hmgn1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5C</xref>).

When analyzed compared to the genomic location of <italic>linc-mipep</italic> in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5D</xref>), we suggest that <italic>linc-mipep</italic> may have resulted from a gene duplication of <italic>linc-wrb</italic> into the neighboring IGSF5 intronic region, which then rearranged to land next to <italic>Mipep</italic> in the teleost genome duplication (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5C, D</xref>).

Since both the daytime and nighttime effects of glucocorticoids were much stronger in the mutants than in similarly treated wild type controls, <italic>linc-mipep</italic> mutants are sensitized to glucocorticoid signaling.

To test the effect of full loss-of-function of both related proteins encoded by <italic>linc-mipep</italic> and <italic>linc-wrb</italic> on chromatin accessibility, we performed omni-ATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Corces et al., 2017</xref>) at 5 dpf comparing WT and double mutant brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A, B</xref>).</p><p>We first observed a broad dysregulation of chromatin accessibility, with 2167 regions losing accessibility and 1220 regions gaining accessibility in <italic>linc-mipep;linc-wrb</italic> mutant brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), with most regions remaining unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>). CTCF/L transcription factor (TF) motifs were enriched in regions that lost accessibility, suggesting a possible dysregulation of 3D chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Enriched TF motifs at regions that lost accessibility were members of the ATF (activating transcription factor)/CREB (cAMP responsive element binding proteins) family, and AP-1 transcription factor components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, left panel). TFs binding at these motifs regulate the expression of immediate early response genes (IEG) such as <italic>c-fos, c-jun,</italic> and <italic>c-myc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sheng and Greenberg, 1990</xref>).

On the other hand, TFs most enriched in regions that gained accessibility were KLF/SP family members, which promote stem cell pluripotency and are downregulated during differentiation, and EGR family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, right panel; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yamane et al., 2018</xref>).

When we analyzed the ‘Mutant Likelihood Score’ (from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) for each cell by its respective cluster, we found that differentiating neuronal progenitor, glial progenitor, and cerebellar granule (excitatory) cell states were more likely to be represented in WT brains, while oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) states were more likely to be represented in <italic>linc-mipep<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, asterisks; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A, B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>).

We specifically assessed <italic>linc-mipep</italic> granule cells and found that they lost accessibility at motifs known to bind the transcription factors Bhlhe22, Hic1, which is expressed in mature cerebellar granule cells and transcriptionally represses <italic>Atoh1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Briggs et al., 2008</xref>)<italic>,</italic> Neurod2, which required for survival of granule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Miyata et al., 1999</xref>), and Nfia, and gained accessibility at binding sites for Gfi1b and Nfatc1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5B</xref>). Purkinje (inhibitory) neurons also showed significant differences in chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3E</xref>), losing accessibility at motifs known to bind the transcription factor Gbx2, which is required for cerebellar development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wassarman et al., 1997</xref>). Furthermore, examining single-cell expression data, we found that, compared to wild-type Purkinje cells, <italic>linc-mipep</italic> mutant Purkinje cells exhibited a significant decrease in the expression of numerous genes, including <italic>roraa, rorb, foxp4</italic>, and <italic>prkcg</italic>, which are required for maturation or maintenance of Purkinje cells in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Takeuchi et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with these results showing cerebellar cell types are affected, Pol II ChIP-seq in 5 dpf brains showed that genes involved in cerebellar development, including <italic>zic2a, ascl1b,</italic> and <italic>atxn3,</italic> have reduced RNA Polymerase II binding in mutant brains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>).</p><p>We next asked whether loss of <italic>linc-mipep</italic> caused any significant changes in chromatin accessibility and gene expression in OPCs.

These changes in accessibility were associated with shifts in gene expression levels consistent with defects in OPC development or maturation, as we found 136 genes that were down-regulated and 57 genes that were up-regulated in <italic>linc-mipep</italic> mutant OPCs relative to wild-type OPCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>).</p><p>To better understand how OPCs may be affected, we further analyzed omni-ATAC-seq analyses in wild type and <italic>linc-mipep;linc-wrb</italic> mutant brains.

To validate that OPCs are affected in vivo, we found a significant 13% decrease (p=0.0053) in <italic>olig2 +</italic> oligodendrocyte progenitor cells’ signal in mutant brains compared to WT brains, with most of the loss coming from the optic tectum and the cerebellum of <italic>Tg(olig2:eGFP); linc-mipep<sup>-/-</sup>; linc-wrb<sup>-/-</sup></italic> compared to control larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we asked whether some of the genes that were differentially regulated in OPC, cerebellar granule cell, or Purkinje cell clusters could explain the dysregulation of NMDA receptor signaling and sensitization to glucocorticoids that we found in our earlier pharmacological profiling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Indeed, we found that some of the differentially regulated genes in single-cell analyses are known to be involved in NMDA receptor and glucocorticoid receptor signaling. For example, <italic>fkbp5</italic>, which is associated with glucocorticoid signaling, showed reduced expression in <italic>linc-mipep</italic> mutant OPCs, and <italic>scg5</italic>, which can mediate stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cao-Lei et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mbikay et al., 2001</xref>), showed reduced expression broadly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">Figure 4—figure supplement 7</xref>). These genes also showed changed chromatin accessibility in the <italic>linc-mipep;linc-wrb</italic> double mutant brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6D</xref> and E). Similarly, numerous genes involved in NMDA receptor activity (<italic>aldocb, ttyh3b, slc1a2b, nrxn1a, grin1b, gpmbaa, atp1a1b</italic>) showed reduced expression in <italic>linc-mipep</italic> mutant OPCs relative to wild-type OPCs, consistent with a reduction in NMDA receptor signaling in mutants (adjusted p-value = 0.0294, GO Molecular Function from FishEnrichR analysis) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). For one of these genes, <italic>grin1b</italic>, we also observed associated changes in chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6F</xref>). At the single-cell level, we find that the expression of <italic>grin1a</italic> and <italic>grin1b,</italic> which encode NMDAR subunits, are significantly downregulated in <italic>linc-mipep</italic> mutant OPCs relative to wild-type OPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">Figure 4—figure supplement 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8A, B</xref>).

Together, these results suggest that loss of <italic>linc-mipep</italic> and <italic>linc-wrb</italic> preferentially affect the development of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and cerebellar cells – evolutionarily newer vertebrate cell types - and these effects may mediate changes in NMDAR and glucocorticoid signaling through changes in chromatin accessibility and gene expression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we present the first zebrafish brain single-cell multiome analysis to understand the cell type-specific effects of loss-of-function of the proteins encoded by <italic>linc-mipep</italic> and <italic>linc-wrb</italic>.

Here, we establish that <italic>linc-mipep</italic> (or <italic>lnc-rps25</italic>) and <italic>linc-wrb,</italic> previously identified as long non-coding RNAs, encode micropeptides with homology to the vertebrate-specific non-histone chromosomal protein HMGN1. While it is possible that <italic>linc-mipep, linc-wrb,</italic> and HMGN1 arose from an originally non-coding transcript, possibly in invertebrates, we identify a basal-most vertebrate sequence in lamprey for an ancestral HMGN protein lacking the key C-terminal regulatory domain of human HMGN1. We propose that this ancestral protein may be derived from an unannotated ORF in the invertebrate, basal chordate <italic>Amphioxus</italic> (lancelet) encoding for an APEX1-like gene in the HMGN1 syntenic region. The emergence of <italic>linc-mipep, linc-wrb,</italic> and HMGN1 in jawed vertebrates, and their effects in cerebellar and oligodendrocyte cells, is intriguing. Neural crest cells, myelinating cells (both oligodendrocytes in the CNS and neural crest-derived Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system), and cerebellar cells (including granule and Purkinje cells) are considered to be among these jawed vertebrate-specific innovations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gans and Northcutt, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lamanna et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sugahara et al., 2021</xref>). We hypothesize that <italic>linc-mipep, linc-wrb,</italic> and HMGN1 co-evolved with the gene regulatory networks that establish these cell types in development, in line with findings from previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">González-Romero et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hock et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ihewulezi and Saint-Jeannet, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zalc, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zalc et al., 2008</xref>), as we find that these evolutionarily newer brain cell types are most affected by loss of <italic>linc-mipep</italic> and <italic>linc-wrb</italic> in zebrafish. It will be important for future studies to investigate the effects of the acquisition and evolution of HMGN genes and their preferential roles in the development of these vertebrate cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">González-Romero et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hock et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ihewulezi and Saint-Jeannet, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zalc, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zalc et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>We find that mutations in <italic>linc-mipep</italic> and <italic>linc-wrb</italic> most affect cerebellar granule and Purkinje cells and OPCs and behavior. Both OPCs and cerebellar cells are typically associated with post-natal growth in humans. The cerebellum is a folded hindbrain structure important for coordinating body movements and higher-order cognitive functions. Our results suggest a plausible explanation for with recent findings in Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) pathology, in which HMGN1 is overexpressed, that developing and adult Down syndrome brains have dysregulated expression of genes associated with oligodendrocyte development and myelination in addition to alterations in the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baxter et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mowery et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Olmos-Serrano et al., 2016</xref>), highlighting the important roles that oligodendrocytes play in normal neurodevelopment and neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jin et al., 2020</xref>).

Altogether, these studies emphasize the importance of non-neuronal and non-cerebral cortex cell types in neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sathyanesan et al., 2019</xref>), in which the vertebrate-specific <italic>Hmgn1</italic> and related proteins may play a unifying role by regulating chromatin accessibility for key transcription factors.</p><p>Our results indicate that loss of <italic>linc-mipep</italic> and <italic>linc-wrb</italic> has an effect on chromatin accessibility, which has an effect on the regulatory activity of multiple TFs and gene expression networks. In particular, chromatin accessibility in mutants is altered at <italic>grin1b,</italic> among other regions, and we find differential regulation of other genes in <italic>linc-mipep</italic> mutant OPCs related with NMDA receptor signaling. These data provide a potential mechanism for how these genes are significantly differentially expressed between wild type and <italic>linc-mipep</italic> mutant OPCs. However, future studies will be needed to understand how these non-histone chromosomal proteins regulate not only this pathway but other epigenetic aspects of neural development and cell function. One possibility is that NMDA signaling is preferentially dysregulated in these cells. Alternatively, NMDA signaling may be broadly dysregulated, while affecting these cells the most. Evidence from early mouse development found that NMDA receptors are most abundant in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells compared to mature oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Biase et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). One study proposes that a main role specifically for NR1 (encoded by <italic>Grin1</italic> in mouse) is to maintain oligodendrocyte glucose transport, which is crucial for the function and health of myelinated axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Saab et al., 2016</xref>). Future investigations will have to reveal exactly how loss of these zebrafish HMGN1 homologs affects the development and maintenance of oligodendrocytes and cerebellar cells and how the intricate cross-talk between these cells is affected in <italic>linc-mipep</italic> and <italic>linc-wrb</italic> mutants. It will also be important to define how the proteins encoded by <italic>linc-mipep</italic> and <italic>linc-wrb</italic> specifically regulate NMDAR signaling and whether this mechanism is conserved in other vertebrate species. Some studies of HMGN1 in mammalian cells have elucidated some of its key molecular mechanisms of gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abuhatzira et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">He et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Prymakowska-Bosak et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Catez et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lim et al., 2005</xref>). Future work will be needed to fully uncover the molecular mechanisms and binding/interaction partners for each protein in zebrafish and across other vertebrate species, to understand to what extent these mechanisms are conserved. We also do not know whether these paralogous genes work cooperatively or redundantly. For example, future work should investigate whether these related genes have distinct and/or partially overlapping targets and binding partners.</p><p>Finally, screening for behavioral phenotypes using F0 mutants is emerging as an important way to decrease time and number of vertebrate animals to enrich for gene candidates for further study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kroll et al., 2021</xref>). Further advances have also increased the resolution of behavioral parameters or patterns affected, allowing for more detailed phenotyping and downstream analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kroll et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ghosh and Rihel, 2020</xref>). This phenotyping approach can further enable screens for other micropeptides that are identified through ribosome profiling or mass spectrometry, lincRNAs, and rare or unannotated candidate disorder risk genes. We note limitations for targeting some of these genes are lower GC content, shorter exon lengths, and inducing larger deletions that may cause a phenotype as a result of a necessary noncoding element. However, there are now non-canonical Cas9s and Cas13s and nearly-PAMless endonucleases that can be tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Treichel and Bazzini, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vicencio et al., 2022</xref>). Current efforts in the field are underway to understand how F0 phenotyping is similar or different from phenotypes observed in stable mutants. Nonetheless, mutations such as those presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> will be important to decipher the role(s) of micropeptides or lincRNAs, including some genes that may have multiple coding and non-coding functions.</p><p>Overall, this study highlights the power of using a high-throughput, genetically tractable vertebrate model to systematically screen for micropeptide function within putative lincRNAs, behavioral phenotypes, signaling pathways, and cell type susceptibilities in early vertebrate development. How novel protein-coding genes may be born from non-coding genomic elements remains an elusive question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Weisman, 2022</xref>). Several short open reading frames encoding for functional, evolutionarily conserved peptides now have been discovered within putative non-coding RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Makarewich and Olson, 2017</xref>), and some of these genes may have emerged along vertebrate lineages (for example, <italic>libra/</italic>NREP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bitetti et al., 2018</xref>). Our analyses support the idea that many more unannotated or undescribed proteins may similarly play critical roles in vertebrate neurodevelopment and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barlow et al., 2020</xref>). We propose that revisiting sORFs identified within putative long non-coding RNAs in basal vertebrates may provide insight into gene innovation and evolution.

Each datapoint represented the number of pixels that changed grey value above a sensitivity threshold, set to 18, for one larva at one frame transition, a metric termed Δ pixels. These files, together with a metadata file labelling each well with a genotype, were input to the MATLAB script Vp_Extract.m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ghosh and Rihel, 2020</xref>), which calculated the following behavioral parameters from the Δ pixels timeseries for both day and night: (1) active bout length (duration of each active bout in seconds); (2) active bout mean (mean of the Δ pixels composing each active bout); (3) active bout standard deviation (mean of the Δ pixels composing each active bout); (4) active bout total (sum of the Δ pixels composing each active bout); (5) active bout minimum (smallest Δ pixels of each bout); (6) active bout maximum (largest Δ pixels of each bout); (7) number of active bouts during the entire day or night; (8) total time active (% of the day or night); (9) inactive bout length (duration of each pause between active bouts in seconds). These measurements were then averaged across both days or both nights to obtain one measure per parameter per larva for the day and night. To build the behavioral fingerprints, we calculated the deviation (Z-score) of each mutant (F0) larva from the mean of their wild-type siblings across all parameters. Plotted in Extended Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and c</xref> for each parameter is the mean ± SEM of the Z-scores.

The behavioral fingerprint of each larva can be conceptualized as a single datapoint in a multidimensional space where each dimension represents one behavioral parameter.

It is critical to keep samples cold and/or on ice for all steps. Briefly, all samples were processed identically and simultaneously to minimize batch effects. Chilled 0.1 X Lysis Buffer (500 μl) was immediately added to frozen samples, and samples were homogenized using a glass dounce tissue grinder with glass pestle. Samples were incubated on ice for 5 min, gently pipetted 10 x, then incubated again for 5 min. Chilled Wash Buffer (500 μl) was gently added to samples. After pipetting the mix 5 x, the samples were passed through 70μm-porosity Flowmi tips into new ice-cold low-bind 1.5 ml tubes. Each suspension was subsequently passed through a 40μm-porosity Flowmi tip into a new ice-cold low-bind 1.5 ml tube. Samples were centrifuged at 500 rcf 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was gently removed without disturbing the nuclei pellet. Chilled Wash Buffer (1 ml) was added, and the nuclei were gently resuspended 5 x. This wash and resuspension step was repeated one more time. On the final step, nuclei were resuspended in Diluted Nuclei Buffer. Quality and number of nuclei (as assessed by &gt;90% Trypan Blue staining and almost no cell clumps) for each sample was assessed using a hemocytometer and were immediately used for tagmentation step using the 10 x Genomics platform. Library preparation was performed following the standard 10 x Genomics protocol (available <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cdn.10xgenomics.com/image/upload/v1666737555/support-documents/CG000338_ChromiumNextGEM_Multiome_ATAC_GEX_User_Guide_RevF.pdf">here</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-27"><title>Data analysis of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq</title><p>Single nuclei from brains of wild type or <italic>linc-mipep</italic> mutant siblings were collected as described above (<italic>Brain collection for molecular analyses</italic>). The raw 10 x Genomics Multiome data of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq were processed using the 10 x Genomics cellranger-arc pipeline (v1.0.1) with the genome, GRCz11. The total numbers of sequenced read pairs per sample for RNA and ATAC were between 197,900,000 and 268,400,000. The estimated numbers of cells for WT and mutant were 7,137 and 7,872, respectively. The mean numbers of raw read pairs per cell were (1) 27,742.56 for RNA and 37,593.97 for ATAC in WT and (2) 26,154.78 for RNA and 27,382.86 for ATAC in mutant. The median numbers of genes per cell for WT and mutant were 349 and 365, respectively. ATAC median high-quality fragments per cell for WT and mutant were 10,466 and 8,626, respectively.</p><p>For downstream analyses, we used the Weighted Nearest Neighbor (WNN) method in Seurat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hao et al., 2021</xref>). The two experimental conditions of WT and mutant were first analyzed separately. Data filtering was based on visual inspection of data distributions. The number of RNA read counts per cell was filtered between 50 and 3000 for WT and between 50 and 5000 for mutant. The number of ATAC read counts per cell was filtered between 500 and 50,000 for WT and between 500 and 80,000 for mutant. The filtering threshold for mitochondrial fractions was 15% for both WT and mutant data. Other parameters were left to default values in Seurat (v4.0.2). The numbers of filtered cells in WT and mutant were 6942 and 7740, respectively. The numbers of filtered ATAC peaks in WT and mutant were 164,266 and 167,925, respectively. We then followed the standard Seurat pipelines, with default parameters, for RNA analysis (SCTransform and PCA) and ATAC analysis (TFIDF and SVD) to obtain a WNN graph as a weighted combination of RNA and ATAC data for each of WT and mutant data. Dimensionality reduction was done by UMAP, clustering by the shared nearest neighbor and smart local moving algorithms, and differential marker identification by Wilcoxon rank sum tests. For analyses of variation in chromatin accessibility and enriched motifs, we used chromVAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schep et al., 2017</xref>) and all motifs from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fornes et al., 2020</xref> database. We also performed a merged analysis of the two conditions in a similar way by merging the two datasets using the <italic>merge</italic> function in Seurat. We did not make any correction for batch effects because the two conditions did not show any distinct batch effects on UMAP plots of the merged data. Cell states, or types, were identified by cross-referencing with known markers on ZFIN and 5 dpf datasets from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Raj et al., 2020</xref>.</p><p>For identification of condition-specific significant ATAC peaks in each cluster, intensity distributions of each peak in WT and mutant were statistically analyzed by the Wilcoxon rank sum and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) methods using one-tailed tests for each condition. Based on manual inspection of p-value distributions of all peaks, we chose raw p-value thresholds of 0.001 and 0.01 for the Wilcoxon and the KS tests, respectively, to deem peaks to be significant. No p-value correction was performed at this filtering step as a strategy of choice. Those significant peaks were further analyzed to identify enriched motifs as described above. In addition, for those clusters of interest, Clusters 8, 35, 38, 39, and 42, we performed a simulation for the number of significant peaks in each cluster by generating 1000 random peak intensity datasets by shuffling the intensity values between WT and mutant as many as the number of cells in the cluster in question. This simulation provided empirical null distributions of the number of significant peaks to obtain p-values. R code for data processing and analyses is available on GitHub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee, 2023</xref>).</p><p>The cells included after filtering from the Seurat analysis were used to perform integrated diffusion and MELD to keep the analyzed dataset consistent. These new techniques were implemented to analyze the data from a different approach. Integrated diffusion was used to combine multimodal datasets, specifically each cell’s RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data, to create a joint data diffusion operator. The 3D integrated PHATE was computed on this joint data diffusion operator as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kuchroo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kuchroo et al., 2021</xref>). To color the plots by likelihood of a cell belonging to the wildtype or mutant sample, this integrated diffusion operator was used for MELD, outputting the likelihood score for each cell belonging to a wildtype or mutant sample.

Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The evolutionary analysis should be expanded significantly which will increase the scope of the results. What happens in other fish species (teleosts but also coelacanth/gar)? Do they also have both proteins? What happens in frogs/birds/reptiles? A multiple-alignment showing the proteins from different representative species of HMGN1 and the new proteins will be particularly informative.</p><p>2) In the initial screen, it is not clear how the candidates for testing were selected and what kind of mutations were introduced in the F0, and what was the efficiency of the editing. As the paper is presented at least in part as an innovative screening effort, it is important to provide these details and outline them in the Results section.</p><p>3) A ChIP-seq experiment of the new proteins appears to be very interesting, but it is basically not described at all. How many peaks were found? Do they resemble each other? How reproducible was the data? A motif-based analysis appears to be very superficial given how instrumental these data (if solid) can be.</p><p>4) The authors should show ribosome profiling data together with the gene structure of examined transcript (ideally, supported by RNA-seq) to visualize the position of ribosome-protected regions within the transcripts (Extended data Figure 1a and Figure 1d). The sequence analyses reveal the similarity between linc-mipep and linc-wrb and should be presented as it is an important finding. The authors should indicate the (expected/predicted) size of both peptides; it was not mentioned in the manuscript.</p><p>5) The different genetic alleles generated for linc-mipep and linc-wrb should be confirmed by DNA sequencing chromatographs; the expression of the linc-mipep and linc-wrb transcripts in the mutants should be confirmed by qRT-PCR as sometimes even small deletions can lead to destabilization or overexpression of the remaining transcripts. This is particularly important for the mutants that show behavioral deviations from wt animals.</p><p>6) In an elegant rescue experiment, the authors demonstrate that CDS of linc-miprep can rescue zebrafish locomotion hyperactivity phenotype. A control experiment with a construct expressing a frameshifted peptide should be included. From the presentation in Figure 2a, the peptide was tagged with FLAG-HA. Can the expression of the peptide be detected by Western blot/immunostaining? Have the authors tried to rescue the phenotype with human HMGN1?</p><p>7) One of the main conclusions from this study is that both micropeptides act together/somewhat redundantly, which would explain why knocking out both peptides has a stronger phenotype than knocking out either peptide individually. While this is a possibility (that they act redundantly, targeting the same regions in the genome), other scenarios are possible, e.g. that they have distinct or only partially overlapping chromatin targets and thus regulate different genes/pathways, which in the end converge on the same behavioral phenotype.</p><p>To resolve this, the rescue with linc-mipep should be attempted for the double mutant and also the single linc-wrb mutant (since it is a ubiquitous overexpression line, it may rescue both). Similarly, a rescue by linc-wrb (which is not shown, also not for the single mutant) would be important to support the conclusion that the phenotype is due to the loss of this peptide, and that it acts redundantly with linc-mipep. Moreover, it will also be important to quantify and provide statistics for the overexpression effect of the rescue construct in the WT background</p><p>Please also address the other points raised by the reviewers to improve the clarity and readability of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In my opinion, the main weakness of the paper is the very limited ability of the molecular phenotypic characterization of the mutants to explain the behavioral and neuropharmacological phenotype. This weakness is partially evident also by the lack of this point in the discussion that focuses on the evolutionary implications and the chromatin remodeling defects observed in the mutants.

This is particularly important for the mutants that show behavioral deviations from wt animals.</p><p>4. In an elegant rescue experiment, the authors demonstrate that CDS of linc-miprep can rescue zebrafish locomotion hyperactivity phenotype. A control experiment with a construct expressing a frameshifted peptide should be included. From the presentation in Figure 2a, the peptide was tagged with FLAG-HA.

The authors should clearly state in the discussion that the molecular mechanisms of action of both studied peptides remain completely unknown. For example, how do they affect chromatin accessibility? What are their interaction partners if any? etc</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript can be significantly improved by addressing the following concerns:</p><p>Concerns and suggestions:</p><p>One of the main conclusions from this study is that both micropeptides act together/somewhat redundantly, which would explain why knocking out both peptides has a stronger phenotype than knocking out either peptide individually. While this is a possibility (that they act redundantly, targeting the same regions in the genome), other scenarios are possible, e.g. that they have distinct or only partially overlapping chromatin targets and thus regulate different genes/pathways, which in the end converge on the same behavioral phenotype.</p><p>To reconcile this, the rescue with linc-mipep should be attempted for the double mutant and also the single linc-wrb mutant (since it is a ubiquitous overexpression line, it may rescue both). Similarly, a rescue by linc-wrb (which is not shown, also not for the single mutant) would be important to support the conclusion that the phenotype is due to loss of this peptide, and that it acts redundantly with linc-mipep. Moreover, it will also be important to quantify and provide statistics for the overexpression effect of the rescue construct in the WT background – is there a significant activity decrease by linc-mipep OE? Overall, the authors mention the dosage-sensitivity of HMGN1 proteins, but with the current analyses fail to provide convincing evidence of a clear dosage effect of the two peptides since they could potentially target different, only in part redundant, genes or have different effects in different cell types. To this end, the use of either the single linc-mipep vs double linc-mipep/linc-wrb mutant is inconsistent in the second half of the manuscript: global ATAC-Seq data is only provided from the double mutant while single-cell-analyses are only provided from the single linc-mipep mutant. Moreover, the ChIP-seq analyses provided are only summarized for both proteins combined in the main Figure, but used individual antibodies, leaving it unclear how the individual profiles look (the authors should follow the standard convention on how to show the quality of ChIP-seq data, e.g. provide ChIP-seq tracks at least for some example genes since the quality of the data remains unclear, and differences between the two Abs cannot be assessed; the Suppl Table 8 also only provides a combined list of 37 genes for which ChIP seq peaks were identified though it would be important to show it individually for each AB; also the number of genes bound appears really really small? Are these ALL genes with a ChIP-seq peak?).</p><p>The second major concern relates to the unclear link between the different phenotypes observed: how can the behavioral phenotypes be reconciled with the molecular phenotypes (chromatin accessibility in specific neurons or precursors), and how can the chromatin accessibility differences in WT vs mutant be reconciled with the measured transcriptional/gene expression differences? Is there any evidence for NMDA being downstream of linc-mipep/wrb regulation? I applaud the authors on generating all these interesting data sets and analyses, but without connecting them together (here the focus for example on just the single linc-mipep mutant would be helpful, but the global brain ATAC-Seq data is only shown for the double mutant; and vice-versa, the single-cell ATAC-Seq data with the chromatin accessibility changes detected in specific cell types is not linked back to the ChIP-seq profiles of the peptides). Do glial progenitors and OPCs of the mutant(s) have altered expression of the underlying loci with altered accessibility? In Figure 4c, e, f, h, and Extended 6c-e, how does the chromatin accessibility translate to rna level in Purkinje cells and radial glia cells? How many sites lose accessibility in OPCs? Is &quot;broad loss&quot; a fair assessment of the observation?</p><p>Without addressing the two major concern points, the statement that linc-mipep and linc-wrb 'broadly regulate the chromatin state of neural cell types, most impacting OPCs and cerebellar granule cell gene expression networks and cell states in a basal vertebrate' appears overstated and would need to phrased differently/softened.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82249.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(1) The evolutionary analysis should be expanded significantly which will increase the scope of the results.

A motif-based analysis appears to be very superficial given how instrumental these data (if solid) can be.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comments. We found 315 peaks, yet we could not analyze if they resemble each other because our ChIP-seq combined the antibodies for both proteins to identify common bound regions using the double maternal-zygotic mutants as controls. To address the reviewer’s comments, we have performed replicate ChIP-seq for each protein in two different experiments to characterize the antibodies independently for ChIP-seq of Linc-wrb and Linc-mipep; however, given the low number of peaks identified (357 for Linc-wrb and 78 for Linc mipep) we are concerned about the validity of these peaks and the application of those antibodies for ChIP-seq. Given these results, we believe that future studies will be needed to perform an in-depth characterization of the binding profile of each individual protein, the regions bound in the chromatin, and the developmental progression of their binding profile in the brain and in other tissues, thus we believe this is beyond the current scope of the paper and have removed this analysis.</p><p>Detailed Response: In our previous submission, we provided a combined ChIP-seq analysis of both proteins at 24 hpf using both antibodies pooled together to identify overlapping binding regions. As a control we had used a double-maternal-zygotic mutant embryos at 24 hpf (over each respective input). The results we presented in the previous submission, through which we performed the motif-based analysis, represented 315 peaks that were called in wild type compared to double MZ <italic>linc-mipep; linc-wrb</italic> mutant embryos. To address the reviewer’s comments, we have performed replicates in two different experiments to characterize the antibodies independently for ChIP-seq. First, we performed a ChIP-seq for each individual antibody, using 4 hpf wild type embryos (for which our lab has optimized the ChIP-seq protocol) and double-mutant 4 hpf embryos as controls (over each respective input). At this 4 hpf timepoint, we found an enrichment of nuclear antibody staining in non-dividing cells, as shown in Figure 2 —figure supplement 2I and J. While we were able to call statistically significant peaks (357 peaks for Linc-wrb (q=0.05) and 78 peaks for Linc-mipep (q=0.05)), visual inspection of the tracks representing the ChIP-seq profile did not provide a clear ChIP-seq signal enrichment at all called peaks that would make us confident of the validity of these results. Please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>. Second, because we had been able to detect the protein by probing with an anti-FLAG antibody in <italic>ubb:linc-mipep-FLAG-HA-T2A-mCherry</italic> embryos (which has a FLAG tag on the C-terminal end of the <italic>linc-mipep</italic> CDS), we reasoned that we may be able to perform ChIP-seq analyses using this transgenic <italic>ubb:linc-mipep-FLAG-HA-T2A-mCherry</italic> which expresses linc-mipep-FLAG protein as assessed by western blot. We performed ChIP-seq analyses using a FLAG antibody for 4 hpf embryos from <italic>ubb:linc-mipep-FLAG-HA-T2A-mCherry</italic> incrosses (to ensure maternally-deposited transcripts and enrichment for protein at early stages) and wild type embryos as a control (over each respective input). These analyses did not result in obvious peaks upon visual inspection of called peaks. Based on these attempts, and our inability to definitively identify peaks that are clearly enriched compared to the control, we have decided to remove the previously submitted results from our analyses and interpretations, and from this report. We believe these results, which were performed at 4 hpf and 24 hpf, do not affect the overall conclusions of the paper which are centered at 5-6 dpf, because we clearly observed differentially regulated regions in chromatin accessibility and gene expression between the wild type and mutant brains at 5-6 dpf. Future efforts will be needed to further explore the chromatin binding profile of these proteins in the brain and other tissues.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-82249-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors should show ribosome profiling data together with the gene structure of examined transcript (ideally, supported by RNA-seq) to visualize the position of ribosome-protected regions within the transcripts (Extended data Figure 1a and Figure 1d).

They further tested 60 overexpression lines in stable transgenic lines, and found only 12 had behavioral phenotypes, spread across sleep-wake parameters, with some increasing, some decreasing, and some having no effect on activity. Based on this data, over-expressing constructs in general are not expected to have consistent non-specific effects on locomotor activity.

I applaud the authors on generating all these interesting data sets and analyses, but without connecting them together (here the focus for example on just the single linc-mipep mutant would be helpful, but the global brain ATAC-Seq data is only shown for the double mutant; and vice-versa, the single-cell ATAC-Seq data with the chromatin accessibility changes detected in specific cell types is not linked back to the ChIP-seq profiles of the peptides). Do glial progenitors and OPCs of the mutant(s) have altered expression of the underlying loci with altered accessibility? In Figure 4c, e, f, h, and Extended 6c-e, how does the chromatin accessibility translate to rna level in Purkinje cells and radial glia cells? How many sites lose accessibility in OPCs?
