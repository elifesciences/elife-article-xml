Recruitment of Drp6 depends on a domain that binds to cardiolipin (CL)-rich bilayers. Consistent with this, nuclear localization of Drp6 was inhibited either by depleting cellular CL or by substituting a single amino acid residue that abolished Drp6 interactions with CL. Inhibition of CL synthesis, or perturbation in Drp6 recruitment to nuclear membrane, caused defects in the formation of new macronuclei post-conjugation. Taken together, our results elucidate a molecular basis of target membrane selection by a nuclear dynamin and establish the importance of a defined membrane-binding domain and its target lipid in facilitating nuclear expansion.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dynamin</kwd><kwd>membrane remodelling</kwd><kwd>tetrahymena</kwd><kwd>target membrane selection</kwd><kwd>nuclear remodelling</kwd><kwd>lipid protein interaction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology , Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BT/PR14643/BRB/10/862/2010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rahaman</surname><given-names>Abdur</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A single amino acid residue is critical for cardiolipin interaction specificity and nuclear membrane recruitment of a dynamin-related protein.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Topological changes and remodeling of membranes are fundamental processes in cellular physiology. Intricate biological machineries have evolved to facilitate these changes in living cells. Dynamins and dynamin-related proteins (DRPs) comprise a family of large GTPases that catalyze membrane remodeling reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Praefcke and McMahon, 2004</xref>). Members of the dynamin family are mechano-chemical enzymes that couple the free energy of GTP hydrolysis with membrane deformation, thereby performing important cellular functions ranging from scission of membrane vesicles, cytokinesis, and maintaining mitochondrial dynamics to conferring innate antiviral immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ramachandran and Schmid, 2018</xref>). The common features shared by all dynamins and DRPs are the presence of a large GTPase domain (GD), a middle domain, and a GTPase effector domain (GED), which distinguish them from other GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Praefcke and McMahon, 2004</xref>). The MD and the GED are involved in oligomerization and regulation of GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ramachandran et al., 2007</xref>). The feature that distinguishes DRPs from classical dynamins is the lack of a defined pleckstrin homology domain (PH domain) and a proline-rich domain.</p><p>All dynamin proteins undergo rounds of assembly and dis-assembly on the target membrane and tubulate the underlying membrane, which is required for fission or fusion function. The members of this family become associated with lipids on the target membrane and are important for performing cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ramachandran and Schmid, 2018</xref>). The PH domain in classical dynamins binds to phosphatidyl inositol 4,5 bis-phosphate (PIP2) at the target sites of endocytosis and plays an essential role in vesicle scission during endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zheng et al., 1996</xref>). All the DRPs lack PH domains and instead possess either lipid binding loops or trans-membrane domains for membrane recruitment or association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ramachandran and Schmid, 2018</xref>). A stretch of positively charged amino acid residues in the lipid binding loops of all known DRPs interacts with the negatively charged head groups of the lipids, and this interaction is important for target membrane association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rujiviphat et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">von der Malsburg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bustillo-Zabalbeitia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Smaczynska-de Rooij et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yan et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Nuclear remodeling including its expansion is a fundamental process in eukaryotes, the mechanism of which is not well understood in any organism. It requires remodeling of nuclear membrane and incorporation of new materials including lipids and proteins into the existing membrane. <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic>, a unicellular ciliate, exhibits nuclear dimorphism. Each cell harbors a small, diploid, transcriptionally inactive micronucleus (MIC) and a large, polyploid, transcriptionally active macronucleus (MAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Karrer, 2000</xref>). During sexual conjugation in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, two cells of complementary mating types first form a pair, followed by a series of complex nuclear events resulting in the loss of the parental MAC. Subsequently, new MIC and MAC are formed through the fusion of haploid nuclei produced from parental micronuclei. The precursors of the new MIC and MAC are identical in size and in genome content at the initial stage of nuclear differentiation. However, two of the four new MICs rapidly enlarge, making the final volume 10- to 15-fold larger, and develop into MACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cole et al., 1997</xref>). This process calls for a sudden and dramatic expansion of nuclear envelope. Drp6, which is one of the eight DRP paralogs in <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, is specifically upregulated when the MICs rapidly expand to form new MACs. Drp6 associates with outer nuclear envelope of both MIC and MAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Elde et al., 2005</xref>), and inhibition of Drp6 function results in a profound deficiency in the formation of new MACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rahaman et al., 2008</xref>). It has been recently demonstrated that Drp6 functions as an active GTPase and self-assembles into higher order helical spirals and ring structures, and therefore resembles other members of the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kar et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we have elucidated a mechanism for Drp6 recruitment in the nuclear membrane. Our results reveal that Drp6 directly interacts with membrane lipids and that CL acts as its physiologically important target lipid. Furthermore, we have identified a lipid-binding domain in Drp6 and provide evidence that the domain plays a pivotal role in nuclear association of Drp6 and therefore in nuclear expansion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A DRP-targeting determinant is important for nuclear recruitment of Drp6</title><p>All the known dynamin family proteins perform cellular functions by associating with a target membrane.

As expected, Drp6 was chiefly present on the nuclear envelope and also on some cytoplasmic puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). These cytoplasmic puncta of Drp6 are endoplasmic reticulum derived vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rahaman et al., 2008</xref>). When confocal images of <italic>GFP-drp6ΔDTD-</italic>expressing cells were analyzed, it was observed that the deletion of DTD resulted in complete loss of nuclear localization, and it was mainly associated with cytoplasmic puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). These results clearly demonstrate that DTD is necessary for recruiting Drp6 to the nuclear envelope, but not to cytoplasmic puncta. We next evaluated if the DTD is sufficient for nuclear envelope targeting, by expressing it as a GFP-fusion protein. The confocal images of cells expressing GFP-<italic>drp6-DTD</italic> showed that GFP-DTD often appeared as cytoplasmic puncta, but that nuclear envelope localization in a subset of cells is detectable albeit less prominently as compared to that of GFP-drp6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). This suggests that the DTD is able to interact with the nuclear envelope. This interaction appears weaker than for the full-length protein, suggesting that other domains also contribute to nuclear recruitment of Drp6. Similarly, other dynamin family members rely for their targeting on a membrane-binding domain but also depends on other domains such as GD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vallis et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">von der Malsburg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bramkamp, 2012</xref>). We conclude that DTD is essential but not sufficient for Drp6 recruitment to the nuclear envelope. In contrast, Drp6 does not require its DTD for targeting to the ER-derived cytoplasmic vesicles.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>DTD is the membrane-binding domain of Drp6</title><p>Recruitment of a protein to a target membrane is achieved either by interaction with membrane lipids or by forming a complex with another membrane protein.

To identify the lipids with which Drp6 interacts, we performed the overlay assay using commercially available strips spotted with fifteen different lipids (Echelon Biosciences, USA). The results demonstrated that Drp6 specifically interacts with three phospholipids, namely phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidic acid (PA), and cardiolipin (CL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). In order to find out whether lipid binding is a property of the DTD, we partially purified DTD as an N-terminal his tagged protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) and used it for the overlay assay. Like the full-length protein, DTD also interacts with all three phospholipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Identification of membrane-binding domain of Drp6.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Coomassie-stained SDS–PAGE gels showing purification of His-drp6 (WT) and His-drp6-DTD (DTD) expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>.

In sucrose density gradients, the recombinant Drp6 co-migrated with all the three types of liposomes, appearing in the top (light) fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>).

A hydrophobic patch in the PH domain of classical dynamin is important for membrane association/insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ramachandran et al., 2009</xref>). The sequence similarity between PH domain of human dynamin 1 and corresponding region of Drp6 is very low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). However, the structural similarity is very high among all the dynamin family proteins whose structures are known. Therefore, we generated a three-dimensional model of Drp6 in order to identify the corresponding hydrophobic region in the DTD. The 3-D modeling of Drp6 shows that the structure of DTD is not related to PH domain, but that nonetheless has a hydrophobic patch (aa 553–555) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>).

This involves self-assembly of helical spirals and ring structures and is important for membrane association and membrane remodeling functions. The self-assembly of Drp6 and Drp6-I553M was evaluated by size exclusion chromatography. Drp6 eluted in the void volume as an oligomer containing at least six monomers, as previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Similarly, Drp6-I553M also formed higher order structures, as the majority of the protein eluted in the void volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). A small peak of material eluting near the 150 kDa marker might correspond to a dimer. The breadth of this smaller peak suggests that it consists of a mixture of monomeric and oligomeric structures, with a dimer at the peak fraction. Since the mutant protein was able to form higher order oligomeric structure, we suggest that mutation does not inhibit its self-assembly. However, there might be a difference in the assembly products formed by the wild-type and mutant proteins. To examine this possibility, we compared the ultrastructure of the wild-type and mutant proteins by electron microscopy of negatively stained preparations of the purified recombinant proteins. The Drp6 appeared mostly as large helical spirals, which are similar to structures found in other DRPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). Ring-like structures were also present, as also found in other members of the family. Similarly, in Drp6-I553M samples, we observed both helical spirals and ring-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). These results suggest that the I553M mutation does not block <italic>in vitro</italic> oligomerization of Drp6. Taken together, our results suggest that defective nuclear localization of Drp6-I553M is not due to defects in GTPase activity or perturbation of self-assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>CL is important for nuclear recruitment of Drp6</title><p>Dynamin family proteins including Drp6 associate with their target membranes by interacting with specific lipids. To ask whether the I553M mutation might affect these interactions, we used <italic>in vitro</italic> membrane-binding assays. Recombinant Drp6 and Drp6-I553M proteins were incubated separately with liposomes containing either 10% CL, or PS, or PA. The association of the proteins with liposomes was then judged based on their co-flotation in sucrose density gradients. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, Drp6 co-floated with all the three liposomes and appeared on the top fractions, whereas Drp6-I553M co-floated with PS- or PA-containing liposomes but failed to co-float with CL-containing liposomes. Since the mutant retains the ability to associate with PS- and PA-containing liposomes, the overall membrane-binding activity of Drp6 does not depend on I553. Instead, the mutation of I553 specifically inhibits interaction with CL. Based on these results, we infer that I553 in the membrane-binding domain is necessary for CL interactions and that these interactions are important for membrane targeting <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Interaction of CL with membrane-binding domain recruits Drp6 to the nuclear membrane.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Floatation assay was performed using liposomes with same composition and analyzed by western blotting as mentioned in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>.

To evaluate whether CL is required for nuclear localization of Drp6, we depleted CL from <italic>GFP-drp6-</italic>expressing cells using pentachlorophenol (PCP), a polychlorinated aromatic compound. PCP is a respiratory uncoupler and a potent inhibitor of CL synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ono and White, 1971</xref>). Within 30 min of PCP treatment, GFP-drp6 dissociated from nuclear envelopes in the majority of cells while remaining associated with cytoplasmic puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Quantitative analysis showed that while GFP-drp6 was localized at the nuclear envelope of all untreated cells, more than 80% of the cells completely lost nuclear localization of GFP-drp6 with the remaining cells showing decreased nuclear localization upon PCP treatment. To check that the nuclear envelope itself remains intact under these conditions, we localized the nuclear pore protein GFP-Nup3/MacNup98B. We found that GFP-Nup3/MacNup98B was clearly associated with nuclear envelopes before or after PCP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Moreover, PCP treatment does not disrupt membrane structure in general since the distribution of a cortical membrane-binding protein GFP-Nem1D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shukla et al., 2018</xref>) was also not affected by this treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>).

To test this, we replaced I553 with alanine in the GFP-drp6-I553A protein and expressed it in the cell. Confocal microscopic analysis demonstrated that, similar to GFP-drp6-I553M, GFP-drp6-I553A also lost its association with nuclear envelope and was detected mostly as cytoplasmic puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). As expected, the wild-type GFP-drp6 was chiefly localized in the nuclear envelope under the same experimental conditions. This result reiterates our earlier conclusion that the I553 residue is critical for nuclear recruitment of Drp6. We further confirmed that the loss of Drp6-I553A recruitment to the nuclear envelope is specifically due to loss of its interaction with CL by performing floatation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). For this purpose, we purified recombinant Drp6-I553A protein and tested its binding to liposomes containing either CL, PS, or PA. Western blot analysis showed that Drp6-I553A lost interaction with CL liposomes while retaining its interaction with PS and PA liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). To rule out that the loss of nuclear association is not due to the defect in GTPase activity or self-assembly, we performed size exclusion chromatography and GTP hydrolysis assay. When the purified recombinant Drp6-I553A protein was subjected to size exclusion chromatography, it eluted primarily in the void volume as higher order oligomeric structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>).

The analysis of far-UV CD spectra showed that Drp6 contains both α-helix and β-sheets as secondary structures with an ellipticity minima at 222 nm. Similar spectra were observed for I553M and I553A mutants. These results suggest that the mutant proteins were able to fold correctly. To rule out any change in the three-dimensional conformation due to the amino acid substitutions, we performed fluorescence spectroscopic analysis using intrinsic fluorescence of the lone tryptophan present in the Drp6 protein. The fluorescence spectra of the wild-type Drp6 showed a peak at around 332 nm, suggesting that the tryptophan residue is mostly buried (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref>). The fluorescence spectra of I553M and I553A mutants did not show significant difference from that of wild type, suggesting that the overall structure of the proteins did not change due to mutations. To further assess the conformation around the I553 residue, acrylamide quenching experiments were performed using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Since the single tryptophan (W548) is located only five amino acid residues apart from the I553, it allowed us to monitor the effect of mutations on the local conformation around this isoleucine residue. The accessibility of the tryptophan was measured by determining the quenching constant (k<sub>q</sub>) for wild-type protein as well as the mutant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6h</xref>).

These results lead us to conclude that the loss of CL interaction with I553A or I553M mutant is not due to a change in overall folding or local conformation of the mutant proteins.

In the present study, we have identified a membrane-binding domain in Drp6 that directly interacts with lipids. Inhibition of CL synthesis blocks nuclear localization of Drp6, suggesting that it plays a critical role in Drp6 recruitment. Further evidence of CL interaction determining nuclear localization of Drp6 comes from the mutation of isoleucine at the 553rd position. The mutant Drp6 proteins lose their nuclear localizations with concomitant loss of interaction with CL without affecting other properties such as GTPase activity and self-assembly into rings/helical spirals. The GFP-drp6-I553M recruited to the nuclear envelope only when co-expressed with wild-type mCherry-drp6, indicating that the mutant protein co-assembles with the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). These results suggest that Drp6 molecules self-assemble on the nuclear envelope, and localizing the oligomer to the envelope does not require all subunits interact with CL. We further demonstrate that Ile at position 553 in the DTD is the sole residue critical for CL interactions, whereas the adjacent two amino acid residues (Glu at 552nd position and Met at 554th position) are not essential for CL interaction specificity. Taken together, these results suggest that a single isoleucine residue in the membrane-binding domain specifies the recruitment of Drp6 to the nuclear membrane.</p><p>We investigated the significance of CL in the nuclear remodeling function of Drp6. Inhibition of CL synthesis as well as perturbation of its interaction with Drp6 phenocopy the loss-of-function phenotype of Drp6, suggesting a role for CL in Drp6-mediated nuclear remodeling. Over-expression of <italic>drp6-DTD</italic> or <italic>drp6ΔDTD</italic> inhibits MAC expansion. Since DTD interacts with lipid including CL, the inhibition of MAC expansion is expected to be by competing with Drp6-CL interaction, concomitantly inhibiting Drp6 recruitment to the nuclear envelope. Inhibition of nuclear expansion by ΔDTD can be due to the inhibition of Drp6 localization on the nuclear envelope by forming a heterogenic complex as it lacks membrane-binding domain and does not associate with nuclear envelope. Based on these results, it can be concluded that CL acts as a molecular determinant in recruiting Drp6 on the nuclear envelope to perform nuclear remodeling function.</p><p>Drp6 is involved in nuclear expansion, which requires the incorporation of new lipids into the existing nuclear membrane, suggesting a membrane fusion function for Drp6. Consistent with this, we recently observed that Drp6 is able to perform membrane fusion <italic>in vitro</italic> (our unpublished results). Membrane fission or fusion involves exchange of lipids between two juxtaposed bilayers, and optimum membrane fluidity is likely to be essential for the exchange of lipids between adjacent leaflets. CL is known to facilitate the formation of apposed bilayers as well as to enhance membrane fluidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Unsay et al., 2013</xref>). Dynamin proteins remodel membrane and bring bilayers to the vicinity during fission or fusion of membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Praefcke and McMahon, 2004</xref>). Therefore, interaction of Drp6 with CL may enhance bilayer interaction and membrane fluidity. Taking together, it is reasonable to conclude that Drp6-CL interaction on the nuclear envelope facilitates nuclear expansion by enhancing membrane fusion and hence is essential for macronuclear expansion.</p><p>Drp6 interacts with three different lipids namely CL, PA, and PS (present study). These interactions with multiple lipids might explain the localization of Drp6 in multiple sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The target specificity is often determined by the interaction of the membrane-binding domain with the specific lipids on the membrane. Although DRPs including Drp6 lack PH domain, they harbor a membrane-binding domain at the corresponding location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1a</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> and 3a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ramachandran and Schmid, 2018</xref>). The sequence diversity in this domain might explain the diverse functions of the family members on different target membranes. While PIP2 present in the plasma membrane associates with endocytic dynamin at the neck of vesicles, CL exclusively present in the mitochondria is recognized by the dynamins possessing mitochondrial remodeling function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Francy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kameoka et al., 2018</xref>). It is important to note that the nuclear envelope of <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> contains 3% CL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nozawa et al., 1973</xref>), and Drp6 (which is specifically present in the ciliate <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>) has evolved to interact with CL for specific recruitment to the nuclear envelope. In addition to nuclear envelope, Drp6 is also associated with ER vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rahaman et al., 2008</xref>). Localization of Drp6-I553M/Drp6-I553A mutants on ER vesicles and their ability to interact with PS and PA on the membrane suggest that Drp6 localization on ER is dependent on either PA or PS or combination of both. Considering the abundance of PA on the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pillai et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pillai et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zegarlińska et al., 2018</xref>), it could be argued that PA is involved in recruitment of Drp6 to ER. We also observed localization of Drp6 on plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), and since PS is also present in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kay et al., 2012</xref>), it is possible that Drp6 associates with plasma membrane via its interaction with PS. Although further experiments are required to find out the role of PS and PA in the recruitment of Drp6 in plasma membrane and ER, our results clearly show that lipid molecules play critical role in compartmentalizing the localization of Drp6 where CL shifts the dynamics from ER vesicles to nuclear envelope.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Drp6 localizes to multiple sites.</title><p>Top: Confocal image of a live <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> cell expressing Drp6 as GFP-fusion protein.

The importance of I553 suggests the importance of hydrophobic patches for target membrane specificity, since CL is known to interact strongly with hydrophobic residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Planas-Iglesias et al., 2015</xref>). This is substantiated in the endocytic dynamin that uses a hydrophobic region including isoleucine at the 533rd position in the PH domain for insertion into the target membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ramachandran et al., 2009</xref>). Our results on isoleucine mutation within the membrane domain also suggest that the presence of a similar hydrophobic patch in Drp6 that is important for membrane interaction specifically via CL present on the nuclear envelope. However, hydrophobicity is not the sole determinant for the specific interaction with CL since methionine, which is also a strong hydrophobic residue, does not interact with CL when substituted for isoleucine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Therefore, it is conceivable that, in addition to hydrophobicity, the side chain of isoleucine plays a critical role in conferring the specificity for the recruitment to the target membrane via interaction with CL. Although residues important for target membrane selection have been identified in many dynamin proteins, they involve a stretch of positively charged amino acids for recognizing anionic head groups of several lipids including CL, PS, and PIP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Salim et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achiriloaie et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vallis et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rujiviphat et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">von der Malsburg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bustillo-Zabalbeitia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Smaczynska-de Rooij et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). However, it is not known how different dynamin proteins distinguish different lipids solely based on ionic interaction. In the present study, we demonstrate that a single isoleucine in the membrane-binding domain of Drp6 provides the specificity for CL. This isoleucine residue, however, does not influence Drp6 interaction with PS or PA, hence distinguishes among different negatively charged lipids. This is the first example of any dynamin protein in which a single amino acid site is shown to be critical for specific lipid interactions, thereby providing an additional target membrane (nuclear membrane) binding property to the protein. In conclusion, our results provide the underlying mechanism of target membrane selection by a nuclear dynamin and underscore the importance of CL interaction with a single amino acid residue in the Drp6 membrane-binding domain in facilitating nuclear expansion.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic>)</td><td valign="top">CU428.2</td><td valign="top">Tetrahymena Stock Center, Cornell University, USA</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:TSC_SD00178">TSC_SD00178</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Wild type</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic>)</td><td valign="top">B2086.2</td><td valign="top">Tetrahymena Stock Center, Cornell University, USA</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:TSC_SD00709">TSC_SD00709</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Wild type</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pVGF <break/>(plasmid)</td><td valign="top">Meng-Chao Yao, FHCRC, Seattle, Washington</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">rDNA-based Tetrahymena <break/>expression vector</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top"><italic>GFP-drp6</italic> <break/>(plasmid)</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Drp6 cloned in pVGF expression vector</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top"><italic>GFP-drp6-DTD</italic> <break/>(plasmid)</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">pVGF vector that expresses aa 517–600 of Drp6</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top"><italic>GFP-drp6-ΔDTD</italic> <break/>(plasmid)</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">pIGF vector expressing Drp6 with deletion of aa 517–600</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top"><italic>GFP-drp6-I553M</italic> <break/>(plasmid)</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">pIGF vector that expresses Drp6-I553M</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top"><italic>GFP-drp6-I553A</italic> <break/>(plasmid)</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">pIGF vector that expresses Drp6-I553A</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top"><italic>GFP-drp6-E552D</italic> <break/>(plasmid)</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">pIGF vector expressing Drp6-E552D</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top"><italic>GFP-drp6-M554L</italic> <break/>(plasmid)</td><td valign="top">This study</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">pIGF vector that expresses Drp6-M554L</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top"><italic>GFP-Nup3/</italic>MacNup98B <break/>(plasmid)</td><td valign="top">Prof. D.L.

We have made all the changes suggested by the reviewers and performed the experiments to address the various concerns raised. Please find below our response to the reviewers’ comments:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>1) This is an interesting study from the Rahaman group that identifies cardiolipin (CL) as a potential binding target for Drp6 recruitment to the nuclear membrane in Tetrahymena (that has a unique nuclear remodeling program). In addition, they identify a residue, I553 in the DTD region, which they claim is a key residue involved in specific CL interactions. While the experiments themselves are technically sound, and are well performed and controlled, I don't find the major conclusion that I553 is involved in direct CL interactions justified or well rationalized. By their own admission (in the Discussion), the conservative mutation I553M may perturb local folding and may indirectly affect CL interactions. There is no test of DTD folding with and without the I553M mutation, nor are there other mutations (e.g. I553A and in the vicinity) tested. CD experiments in the absence and presence of CL<sup>-</sup>containing membranes will likely yield information on the impact of the I553 mutations, while DLS experiments would inform on the hydrodynamic properties (overall 3D fold) of the DTD and the impact of these mutations. CL interactions generally involve a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic forces. Where do the electrostatic interactions come from? Why would an Isoleucine to Methionine mutation affect the hydrophobic component, even if I553 is the key hydrophobic residue?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for appreciating our work. We agree that the exact mechanism of how I553 provides specificity to cardiolipin binding was not addressed adequately in the previous manuscript. We have now performed several experiments to address this issue. Our results clearly show that isoleucine at 553 position is critical for cardiolipin binding and nuclear recruitment of Drp6 and the interaction is direct.</p><p>To show that the interaction is direct we have generated another mutant I553A and performed all the experiments including nuclear localization, cardiolipin binding, self-assembly, GTPase activity. Similar to I553M, I553A mutant also failed to bind cardiolipin and to associate with nuclear membrane without affecting GTPase activity and self-assembly of Drp6.These results confirm that isoleucine is critical at this position. We have included these results in Figure 6A-E and Figure 6—figure supplement 1 in the revised manuscript.</p><p>To demonstrate that overall folding is not changed due to mutations at this position, we have performed CD spectroscopic analysis and found that mutations didn’t affect overall folding. We have also included these results in Figure 6F in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Additionally, we have performed fluorescence spectroscopy using the only tryptophan (W548) residue present nearby I553. The tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra of mutants (I553M and I553A) were similar to that of wildtype Drp6 suggesting there is no major change in conformation due to mutations. To evaluate any minor change in the local conformation due to mutations, we have performed acrylamide quenching experiments using the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. The results show that quenching constants of both the mutants were similar to that of wildtype Drp6, and therefore we conclude that the local conformation is not changed due to mutations. These results are included in Figure 6G and 6H in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Electrostatic interactions are important for all the phospholipids while interacting with protein and is expected to come from other amino acid residues which are positively charged. Electrostatic interaction may contribute to the affinity of the interaction by providing additional binding energy. But considering its universal nature of interaction with all the phospholipids, it cannot give specificity for a specific lipid and hence would not discriminate among different phospholipids.</p><p>Regarding the hydrophobic component, the reviewer is correct that both are strong hydrophobic amino acids and loss of I553M interaction with cardiolipin may not be due to change in hydrophobicity. This is now explicitly mentioned in the manuscript. Therefore, it appears that the side chain of isoleucine at 553 position is important for binding to cardiolipin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>2) The addressed phenomenon is restricted to Tetrahymena and may not have far reaching implications. Regardless, the identification of CL as a binding target for Drp6 at the nuclear membrane of this organism is in itself significant. The conclusion that I553 is the key CL binding residue is however not warranted. Additional experiments are needed to dissect how this residue impacts CL interactions and examine whether the observed effect is direct or indirect.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for appreciating the significance of this work.

This paper focused on Drp6, one of the eight dynamin superfamily proteins of Tetrahymena, and analyzed its nuclear envelope localization mechanism by a combination of in vivo cytogenetical analysis and in vitro biochemical analysis for the various mutant Drp6 proteins. Results showed that a specific amino acid residue (isoleucine at the 553rd) in the membrane binding domain of Drp6 was required for its nuclear membrane localization, but this residue is not required for ER/endosome localization and GTPase activity. Furthermore, in vitro floating analysis using centrifugation indicated that Drp6 specifically bound to the cardiolipin at the 553rd isoleucine residue and this binding was required for Drp6's nuclear membrane localization. Finally, removal of cardiolipin from the conjugating cells using inhibitor treatment showed that cardiolipin was required for the new macronucleus formation (including the expansion of macronuclear envelope) through the function of Drp6. Based on these results, authors concluded that cardiolipin targets Drp6 to the nuclear membrane in Tetrahymena.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>The experimental data presented in this paper are reasonable and the results are solid, and therefore I think the deduced conclusions are convincing. However, to improve this paper, I have several minor comments to be revised before publication.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) In the previous paper, it has been shown that GFP-Drp6 is localized in the inner nuclear membrane of both macronucleus and micronucleus. In this paper, however, this point is not clearly stated and is not shown in the figures. I could not understand such localization pattern of GFP-Drp6 in Figure 1C and Figure 3B and the statements in the text. I suggest adding such statements somewhere in Introduction or Result section. Also, add adequate references to the corresponding statements in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this important aspect of localization.

Please add arrows in those figures to point out the position of micronucleus in those figures if necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct about artificial redistribution of proteins that may arise from fixation.

Because Nup3 is the Tetrahymena paralogs of human Nup98 and the name of &quot;Nup98&quot; is well established to call these homologs in various eukaryotes, I suggest adding the name of &quot;MacNup98B&quot; after the word of &quot;Nup3&quot; for reader's better understanding.

It may be interesting to point out that large-scale nuclear envelope reorganization including the formation of the redundant nuclear envelope and the type-switching of the NPC (from the MIC-type NPC to the MAC-type one) has been reported at this developmental stage (Iwamoto et al., JCS 2015). For example, the peculiar shaped nuclear envelope with the redundant/overlapping nuclear envelope structure can be seen and the MAC-type NPCs rapidly assembles to the expanding nuclear envelope. It may be interesting to point out that cardiolipin and Drp6 may be involved in these phenomena. But it is too speculative and therefore consider adding such a discussion as an option.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the correlation between cardiolipin and Drp6 with type switching of the NPC.

These results clearly suggest that I553 is the key amino acid residue for conferring cardiolipin binding specificity and thereby specificity for nuclear recruitment.
