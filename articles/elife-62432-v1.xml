expand T<sub>reg</sub> cells. IL-2/JES6 are effective in the treatment of autoimmune diseases and in protecting against rejection of pancreatic islet allografts. However, we found that IL-2/JES6 also dramatically increase sensitivity to LPS-mediated shock in C57BL/6 mice. We demonstrate here that this phenomenon is dependent on endogenous IFN-γ and T cells, as it is not manifested in IFN-γ deficient and nude mice, respectively. Administration of IL-2/JES6 leads to the emergence of CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells producing IFN-γ in various organs, particularly in the liver. IL-2/JES6 also increase counts of CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>+</sup> cells in the blood and the spleen with higher sensitivity to LPS in terms of TNF-α production and induce expression of CD25 in these cells. These findings indicate safety issue for potential use of IL-2/JES6 or similar IL-2-like immunotherapeutics.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>il-2/anti-il-2 mab complexes</kwd><kwd>CD25</kwd><kwd>T cells</kwd><kwd>IFN-γ</kwd><kwd>LPS</kwd><kwd>hyperreactivity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001824</institution-id><institution>Czech Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>13-12885S</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tomala</surname><given-names>Jakub</given-names></name><name><surname>Weberova</surname><given-names>Petra</given-names></name><name><surname>Tomalova</surname><given-names>Barbora</given-names></name><name><surname>Sivak</surname><given-names>Ladislav</given-names></name><name><surname>Kovar</surname><given-names>Marek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Institutional Research Concept RVO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>61388971</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tomala</surname><given-names>Jakub</given-names></name><name><surname>Weberova</surname><given-names>Petra</given-names></name><name><surname>Tomalova</surname><given-names>Barbora</given-names></name><name><surname>Jiraskova Zakostelska</surname><given-names>Zuzana</given-names></name><name><surname>Sivak</surname><given-names>Ladislav</given-names></name><name><surname>Kovarova</surname><given-names>Jirina</given-names></name><name><surname>Kovar</surname><given-names>Marek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001824</institution-id><institution>Czech Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18-12973S</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tomala</surname><given-names>Jakub</given-names></name><name><surname>Weberova</surname><given-names>Petra</given-names></name><name><surname>Tomalova</surname><given-names>Barbora</given-names></name><name><surname>Sivak</surname><given-names>Ladislav</given-names></name><name><surname>Kovar</surname><given-names>Marek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003243</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NV19-03-00179</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiraskova Zakostelska</surname><given-names>Zuzana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Strong sustained IL-2 signal selective for CD25<sup>+</sup> cells induces emergence of CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup> T cells producing IFN-γ in various organs causing enormous increase in the sensitivity to LPS.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>IL-2 is a crucial cytokine for activation, expansion, and expression of effector functions of T and NK cells as well as for homeostasis of regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyman and Sprent, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Malek and Castro, 2010</xref>). IL-2 exerts its biological activities through binding to either a dimeric receptor composed of IL-2Rβ (CD122) and common cytokine receptor gamma chain (γ<sub>c</sub>, CD132) or to a trimeric receptor composed of a dimeric one with the addition of IL-2Rα (CD25) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Minami et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Waldmann, 1989</xref>). CD25 is not involved in signal transduction, but increases the affinity of the trimeric receptor for IL-2 by about 100-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Minami et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Waldmann, 1989</xref>). The dimeric receptor (K<sub>d</sub> ~1 nM) is mostly found on memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T and NK cells, whilst the trimeric receptor (K<sub>d</sub> ~10 pM) is typically expressed at high levels by T<sub>reg</sub> cells, recently activated T cells and ILC2s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyman and Sprent, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Roediger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sakaguchi et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>IL-2 was the first immunotherapy approved for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma in the early 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atkins et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Klapper et al., 2008</xref>), having induced an overall response in 15–17% of patients with these cancers including 5–10% durable complete remissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atkins et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Klapper et al., 2008</xref>). However, an extremely short half-life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Donohue and Rosenberg, 1983</xref>) and serious side toxicities associated with high-dose IL-2 treatment are the major drawbacks. Moreover, IL-2 treatment leads to expansion of T<sub>reg</sub> cells which can dampen effector T cell activity against tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berendt and North, 1980</xref>). Indeed, it has been shown that long-term, low-dose IL-2 therapy preferentially stimulates T<sub>reg</sub> cells due to their constitutive high expression of trimeric IL-2R and can be used for treatment of autoimmune diseases and delaying allograft rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Klatzmann and Abbas, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yu et al., 2009</xref>). However, due to significant limitations of IL-2, strong attempts have been made to improve IL-2-based therapy. One of the most promising approaches is to employ complexes of IL-2 and certain anti-IL-2 mAbs. It has been demonstrated that these complexes not only markedly prolong the half-life of parenterally administered IL-2 (from minutes to hours) but they also exert selective stimulatory activity for different immune cell populations depending on the mAb used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tomala et al., 2009</xref>). Complexes of murine IL-2 and S4B6 mAb (IL-2/S4B6 henceforth) were shown to potently stimulate memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T and NK cells, whilst complexes of murine IL-2 and JES6-1 mAb (IL-2/JES6 henceforth) highly selectively expand T<sub>reg</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Spangler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tomala et al., 2009</xref>). Selectivity of IL-2/JES6 for cells expressing the high-affinity IL-2R is governed by the fact that the binding site for JES6-1 mAb and CD122/CD132 in the IL-2 molecule, almost completely overlap. IL-2/JES6 is thus not able to bind to IL-2R and induce signaling per se. However, CD25 can engage IL-2 bound to JES6-1 mAb, particularly when expressed at high levels, and progressively ‘peel off’ the cytokine from the antibody in a zipper-like mechanism, ultimately leading to dissociation of JES6-1 mAb. Once JES6-1 mAb dissociates, the CD25-bound IL-2 is liberated to recruit CD122/CD132 to form the functional signaling complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Spangler et al., 2015</xref>). Selectivity of IL-2/JES6 for CD25<sup>+</sup> cells results in their high efficacy to expand T<sub>reg</sub> cells in vivo and makes them an attractive immunotherapeutic. It has been shown that IL-2/JES6 could be used for treatment of various autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Izquierdo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Webster et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wilson et al., 2008</xref>) and to facilitate long-term acceptance of allografts without the need for immunosuppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Webster et al., 2009</xref>). A single-chain format of IL-2/JES6 was produced with a mutated JES6-1 mAb-binding site, termed JY3, which affected the affinity for IL-2. This proved to be effective in selective expansion of T<sub>reg</sub> cells and in the model of autoimmune colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Spangler et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, there is a report describing the development of fully human mAb binding human IL-2 with the capacity to selectively expand T<sub>reg</sub> cells in vivo when complexed with human IL-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Trotta et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>It has been shown that T<sub>reg</sub> cells expanded by IL-2/JES6 produce IL-10 and TGF-β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Webster et al., 2009</xref>). We therefore decided to explore the possibility that IL-2/JES6 are able to protect against LPS-induced toxicity. Interestingly, we found that short-term pre-treatment (three daily doses) with IL-2/JES6 dramatically increases sensitivity of C56BL/6 mice to LPS-induced shock and mortality. Thus, we decided to further investigate this phenomenon and to uncover the mechanism responsible for IL-2 signal-mediated LPS hyperreactivity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IL-2/JES6, but Not IL-2/S4B6, dramatically increase sensitivity to LPS</title><p>We asked whether selective expansion of T<sub>reg</sub> cells via treatment with IL-2/JES6 could lead to protection from the toxic effect of LPS. To answer this we injected C56BL/6 mice with three daily doses of IL-2/JES6 (1.5 µg IL-2/dose) and challenged these mice with LPS 48 h after the last dose of IL-2/JES6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We titrated LPS dosing in previous experiments in order to determine the maximum non-lethal dose (MNLD), that is, the highest dose that causes significant toxic effect but no mortality. Since we found that toxicity of LPS varies from batch to batch even if ordered as identical product from the same commercial supplier, we isolated a large batch of LPS from <italic>S. typhymurium</italic> LT2, S-strain (see Materials and methods) and used it throughout the whole study. We determined that the MNLD of our LPS was ~200 µg/mice in C56BL/6 mice. Control C56BL/6 mice developed hypothermia starting about 4–6 h after LPS challenge (100% of MNLD) and peaking after approximately 24 h. However, all mice recovered over the next 2 d. Mice injected with a low dose of LPS (10% of MNLD) developed only negligible hypothermia 8 h after LPS injection and fully recovered within 24 h. Contrary to that, the same low dose of LPS induced extremely rapid onset of progressively worsening hypothermia when mice were pretreated with IL-2/JES6 and the mice usually died within 8–24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Next, we decided to determine the kinetics of sensitization to LPS by IL-2/JES6. Mice pretreated with IL-2/JES6 as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> were challenged at different time points after IL-2/JES6 treatment with low dose of LPS (10% of MNLD). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> shows that LPS caused 100% mortality when injected up to 2 d post IL-2/JES6 treatment and 40% mortality when injected 3 d after that. Significant hypothermia, but no mortality was seen when LPS was injected 4 d post IL-2/JES6. No sensitization to LPS was found when LPS was injected 6 d post IL-2/JES6. These data shows that IL-2/JES6 dramatically increase sensitivity to LPS in C56BL/6 mice and that this increased sensitivity lasts about 4 d post IL-2/JES6 treatment.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>IL-2/JES6 dramatically increase sensitivity to LPS-induced shock and mortality.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schedule of sensitization of mice to LPS through administration of IL-2/JES6 used throughout the study, unless stated otherwise.

Thus, IL-2 complexes with selective stimulatory activity for CD25<sup>high</sup> cells, but not those which stimulate predominantly CD122<sup>high</sup> cell populations, dramatically increase sensitivity to LPS.

We found that mice pretreated with IL-2 developed more profound hypothermia than controls, however, no mortality was recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Thus, IL-2 alone can produce a slight increase in sensitivity to LPS when a high dosage is used. We decided to test whether IL-2 bound to a biocompatible polymeric carrier based on poly(<italic>N</italic>-(2-propyl)methacrylamide) would be more effective in sensitization to LPS. The rationale here is that IL-2 bound to this polymeric carrier has a significantly prolonged half-life in circulation (3–4 h, i.e., similar to IL-2 complexes) thus providing a more sustained IL-2 signal but with no selectivity for CD25<sup>high</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Votavova et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, IL-2 bound to a polymeric carrier sensitized C56BL/6 mice to LPS substantially more effectively than IL-2. The LPS challenge with 50% of MNLD caused more severe hypothermia and 50% mortality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These data demonstrate that durability of the IL-2 signal plays a remarkable role in sensitization to LPS via IL-2. However, sensitivity to LPS induced by IL-2 bound to the polymeric carrier is still much weaker in comparison to IL-2/JES6, showing that selectivity for CD25<sup>high</sup> cells is also important. We injected LPS 48 h after the last dose of IL-2 complexes in our sensitization experiments. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that there was still a biologically active concentration of these complexes at the time of LPS administration since the half-life of IL-2 complexes was determined to be several hours. However, to exclude the possibility that increased sensitivity to LPS is caused by the presence of IL-2 complexes at the time of LPS injection, that is, that LPS and IL-2 complexes acts together at the same time, we injected C56BL/6 mice with either IL-2/JES6 or IL-2/S4B6 and simultaneously challenged them with LPS (10% or 35% of MNLD, respectively). Simultaneous co-administration of IL-2 complexes and LPS did not increase toxicity of LPS, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. These data show that it is important the IL-2/JES6 to be present before LPS administration rather than at the time of administration in order to induce LPS hyperreactivity. Thus, IL-2/JES6 either act on cells that are able to directly respond to LPS making them hyperresponsive, or they activate some immune cell subset(s), which in turn mediates LPS hyperreactivity, for example, via production of some effector molecule(s).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Strong sustained IL-2 signal and not solely IL-2/JES6, increases sensitivity to LPS; IL-2/JES6-mediated sensitivity to LPS could be completely blocked by αCD25 mAb.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) C56BL/6 mice were treated with rmIL-2 (35 µg/dose) according to the schedule shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and challenged with LPS (50% of MNLD).

We found that treatment of C56BL/6 mice with IL-2/JES6 (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) increased relative counts of CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>+</sup> cells in the spleen and blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>) as well as absolute counts of these cells in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We also found that treatment with IL-2/JES6 expands myeloid cells in general. IL-2/JES6 expanded significantly granulocytes, eosinophils and DCs and elevated, though not significantly, relative counts of monocytes and macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Of note, treatment with IL-2/JES6 increased MHC II expression on monocytes and macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The proliferation of myeloid cells driven by IL-2/JES6 was further confirmed by BrdU incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). IL-2/JES6 also remarkably increased responsiveness of CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>+</sup> cells from the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>) and blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>) to LPS in term of TNF-α production.

These data collectively show that treatment with IL-2/JES6 increases both the counts of LPS-responsive myeloid cells in various body compartments and their responsiveness to LPS. We asked a question whether this increased responsiveness of myeloid cells to LPS was due to the increased expression of TLR4. Thus, we analyzed <italic>Tlr4</italic> expression in spleen cells via quantitative RT-PCR and in various myeloid cell subsets via flow cytometry. Treatment with IL-2/JES6 did not affect the <italic>Tlr4</italic> expression in splenocytes on mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Thus, we decided to compare sensitization to LPS by IL-2/JES in C56BL/6 mice and BALB/c mice. C56BL/6 mice are described as a strand with sufficient IFN-γ production while BALB/c mice are poor producers. We determined levels of various cytokines in sera of C56BL/6 and BALB/c mice pretreated with IL-2/JES6 at different time points after LPS challenge. Levels of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-12, and IL-6 were much higher in sera of C56BL/6 mice pretreated with IL-2/JES6 in comparison with controls, despite the fact that control mice were challenged with 10-times higher doses of LPS. Contrary to this, levels of the above mentioned cytokines were comparable in sera of control and IL-2/JES6 pretreated BALB/c mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Furthermore, BALB/c mice pretreated with IL-2/JES6 showed much milder sensitization to LPS in term of hypothermia and mortality than C56BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These data show that the endogenous production of IFN-γ upon IL-2/JES6 administration probably plays a crucial role in sensitization to LPS. To confirm a key role of IFN-γ directly, we injected C56BL/6 mice with anti-IFN-γ mAb prior to IL-2/JES6 pretreatment and LPS challenge. Indeed, anti-IFN-γ mAb markedly diminished sensitization to LPS by IL-2/JES6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Since T cells are the most prominent IFN-γ producers, we decided to test sensitization to LPS by IL-2/JES6 in athymic Nu/Nu mice lacking T cells. We found that IL-2/JES6 almost do not sensitize Nu/Nu mice to LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). On the other hand, Nu/Nu mice with adoptively transferred CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells from C56BL/6 mice injected with IL-2/JES6 showed very high sensitization to LPS upon IL-2/JES6 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). These data show that IL-2/JES6 is able to induce IFN-γ production in T cells even in the absence of TCR signal except that provided by self-MHC molecules.

The key question is therefore, which T cell subset(s) produces IFN-γ upon IL-2/JES6 treatment? The ability to utilize IL-2/JES6 strictly requires CD25 expression and the only T cells expressing CD25 in naïve unprimed mice are T<sub>reg</sub> cells. However, T<sub>reg</sub> cells are considered as a T cell subset with no ability to produce IFN-γ under normal conditions. Nevertheless, we found that administration of IL-2/JES6 potently expanded CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup> T cells in both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> subsets and that these cells proliferate more vigorously in response to IL-2/JES6 than T<sub>reg</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>IL-2/JES6 drive expansion of CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup> T cells producing IFN-γ in lymphoid as well as non-lymphoid tissues</title><p>We focused on CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells robustly expanded in the spleen of mice treated with IL-2/JES6. Since these cells resemble by their phenotype activated T cells, we presumed that these cells could be a key producers of IFN-γ in IL-2/JES6 treated mice causing the increased sensitivity to LPS. Thus, we decided to investigate whether these cells were expanded also in other organs except of spleen and whether they produced IFN-γ. Interestingly, we found that treatment of C56BL/6 mice with IL-2/JES6 led to the induction of these cells in both lymphoid tissues (spleen) as well as in non-lymphoid tissues (liver and lungs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Relative counts of CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were particularly high in the liver where they typically represented about 6% and 10% of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, respectively. We asked whether these CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are able to produce IFN-γ upon IL-2/JES6 administration in vivo. To answer this, C56BL/6 mice were treated with IL-2/JES6 as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and brefeldin A was injected 2 h after the last dose of IL-2/JES6 to enable the detection of IFN-γ production in various T cell subsets intracellularly. We proved that CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in spleen, liver, and lungs produced IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). Again, relative counts of these cells producing IFN-γ were especially high in the liver and generally higher in the CD8<sup>+</sup> subset in comparison to the CD4<sup>+</sup> subset. Notably, T<sub>reg</sub> cells in the liver of C56BL/6 mice treated with IL-2/JES6 also produced IFN-γ showing that T<sub>reg</sub> cells may surprisingly participate in sensitization to LPS. IL-2/S4B6 almost did not induce CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in any tissue studied.

IFN-γ sufficient C56BL/6 mice pretreated with IL-2/JES6 showed dramatically increased sensitivity to LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>). Altogether, we conclude that IL-2/JES6 give rise to CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells producing IFN-γ in various tissues, particularly in liver. IL-2/JES6 also expand LPS responsive CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells and increase expression of CD25 in these cells. IFN-γ later acts on these myeloid cells and increases their responsiveness to LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>It has previously been shown that IL-2/JES6 immunocomplexes potently expand T<sub>reg</sub> cells in vivo and that they can be used for treatment of various autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Webster et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wilson et al., 2008</xref>). However, our results clearly demonstrate that these immunocomplexes also dramatically increase sensitivity to LPS. The key mechanism is the production of IFN-γ since administration of anti-IFN-γ mAb as well as the use of IFN-γ<sup>-/-</sup> mice abrogates the sensitization. This resembles the so-called Schwartzman-like shock reaction, an experimental model of lethal systemic inflammatory reaction induced by LPS injection. It is induced by two consecutive, rather low doses of LPS (preparatory and provocative ones) and occurrence of the reaction requires very exact dosage and careful timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Heremans et al., 1990</xref>). The first LPS injection is given into the footpad, followed after 24 h by an i.v. dose. Administration of anti-IFN-γ mAb was found to completely prevent the reaction. Thus, a preparatory dose of LPS induces production of IFN-γ which consequently sensitizes immune cells to be hyperresponsive to a provocative dose of LPS. Contrary to the Schwartzman-like shock reaction, IL-2/JES6 is responsible for inducing the production of IFN-γ and for sensitization to LPS in our experimental system. Administration of anti-IFN-γ mAb before IL-2/JES6 treatment could, however, have two effects: it could prevent sensitization of immune cells to LPS or it could protect against the toxic effect of a massive production of IFN-γ upon LPS injection since IgG has a relatively long half-life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vieira and Rajewsky, 1988</xref>). Thus, we compared the effect of anti-IFN-γ mAb administered either before pretreatment with IL-2/JES6 or after it, that is, shortly before LPS challenge (4 h). Anti-IFN-γ mAb had higher protective effect when injected before IL-2/JES6 pretreatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) further confirming the key role of IL-2/JES6-induced IFN-γ production for sensitization to LPS.</p><p>The key question was: which cells produce IFN-γ upon treatment with IL-2/JES6? IFN-γ is normally produced by effector T cells after their activation and expansion. It requires a TCR signal and is significantly augmented by the presence of IL-12 and IL-18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berg et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nakanishi, 2018</xref>). However, IL-2 was shown to be also able to promote IFN-γ production, but usually in activated T cells, that is, upon TCR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyman and Sprent, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cousens et al., 1995</xref>). Here, we show that a strong sustained IL-2 signal provided by IL-2/JES6 is able to induce production of IFN-γ in T cells in vivo even in the absence of a TCR signal, except that provided by self-MHC molecules. Contact with self-MHC class I and II molecules (low affinity interaction) is known to play an important role in homeostasis of naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kieper et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sprent and Surh, 2011</xref>), but should not endow these cells with the capacity to express effector functions like IFN-γ production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kieper et al., 2004</xref>). We saw the highest relative counts of IFN-γ-producing T cells in CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> populations. Nevertheless, CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells also produced IFN-γ in IL-2/JES6-treated mice, particularly in liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). One simple explanation could be that the strong sustained IL-2 signal provided by IL-2/JES6 also induces production of IFN-γ in T<sub>reg</sub> cells. However, we speculate that the IFN-γ produced by CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells may be a trigger for IFN-γ production in T<sub>reg</sub> cells since it was shown previously that T<sub>reg</sub> cells can be converted into IFN-γ-producing cells, especially in a strongly pro-inflammatory milieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Koenecke et al., 2012</xref>) and/or in the presence of IFN-γ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wood and Sawitzki, 2006</xref>). On the other hand, T<sub>reg</sub> cells seems to be dispensable for sensitization to LPS via IL-2/JES6 as administration of anti-CD4 mAb had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This shows that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells can substitute CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the process of sensitization, however, complete absence of T cells abolishes it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>It has been shown that treatment with nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub>¯), an important biological NO reservoir in vasculature and tissues, significantly attenuates hypothermia, tissue infarction and mortality in a mouse shock model induced by a lethal TNF-α or LPS challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cauwels et al., 2009</xref>). We therefore asked whether nitrite could protect, at least to some extent, IL-2/JES6 pretreated mice challenged with LPS, since we observed very high serum levels of TNF-α in these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Indeed, nitrite was considerably effective in lowering hypothermia and mortality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) showing that a massive production of TNF-α is a dominant pathogenic factor responsible for rapid onset of hypothermia in IL-2/JES6 sensitized mice challenged with LPS. Pathogenic effects that occur later on are mediated by other cytokines, particularly by IFN-γ. This is supported by the fact that serum levels of TNF-α peak very early (1–2 h) post LPS challenge while serum levels of IFN-γ peak around 6 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>Treatment with IL-2/JES6 not only affected T cell populations but to our surprise also affected some myeloid cell populations, particularly CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>+</sup> cells (monocytes/macrophages). Although IL-2 is a pleiotropic cytokine, it has stimulatory activity mostly for cells of lymphoid origin, especially for T<sub>reg</sub>, recently activated T, memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T, and NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Malek, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sharma and Das, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yu et al., 2000</xref>). Increased counts of CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>+</sup> cells in response to IL-2/JES6 are thus intriguing. We tested the hypothesis that T cells upon stimulation with IL-2/JES6 do not produce GM-CSF but no production of this cytokine was found. However, there is a report showing that clonogenic common lymphoid progenitor (CLP), a bone marrow-resident cell that gives rise exclusively to lymphocytes, can be redirected to the myeloid lineage by stimulation through an exogenously expressed IL-2 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kondo et al., 2000</xref>). Authors suggest that CLPs and pro-T cells may have a latent granulocyte/monocyte lineage differentiation program that can be initiated by signaling through the reconstituted IL-2 receptor. We hypothesize that a strong IL-2 signal provided by IL-2/JES6 may lead to a similar effect. Nevertheless, this hypothesis requires that at least a fraction of CLPs express complete trimeric IL-2R at some stage of their development. Even low expression levels should be sufficient since it has been previously shown that IL-2/JES6 feeds back onto CD25 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Spangler et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>An interesting feature of IL-2/JES6 treatment is the increased counts of CD45<sup>+</sup> cells (i.e. any haematopoietic cells, except erythrocytes) in the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). This increase was found both in the T cell population (see later) as well as in CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6B</xref> and C). A decent increase in counts of CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>+</sup> cells was also found in the lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref>). We believe that accumulation of these cells in liver and lungs might significantly contribute to the pathological effects seen after LPS challenge in IL-2/JES6 pretreated mice, since these cells are likely to be sensitized to LPS via IFN-γ produced by CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells. This is not the case with IL-2/S4B6 pretreatment as there are much fewer IFN-γ-producing CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Further, treatment with IL-2/JES6 per se induces more severe lung oedema in comparison to treatment with IL-2/S4B6, which could contribute to the morbidity and mortality after LPS challenge to some extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We injected both IL-2/JES6 and LPS into mice via i.p. injections. There is a population of macrophages in the peritoneal cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cassado et al., 2015</xref>) and therefore we asked whether these cells might contribute to the LPS sensitivity. However, adoptive transfer of peritoneal exudate cells from mice i.p. injected with IL-2/JES6 did not increase sensitivity to LPS in adoptively transferred mice. Moreover, i.v. administration of IL-2/JES6 leads to the same level of LPS sensitivity in comparison to i.p. administration. Therefore, we can rule out the idea that peritoneal macrophages play an important role.</p><p>We found significantly increased counts of T cells in the liver of mice treated with IL-2/JES6 or IL-2/S4B6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We do not know the mechanism of T cell accumulation in the liver upon treatment with either IL-2 complexes, however, we can speculate that IL-2 complexes (M<sub>w</sub> ~190 kDa) are easily accessible in the liver interstitium due to the massive fenestration of capillaries in this organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DeLeve, 2015</xref>). It seems that the liver and secondary lymphoid organs are the sites where increased numbers of CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>+</sup> and IFN-γ-producing T cells colocalize upon IL-2/JES6 treatment, and this feature governs LPS hyperresponsiveness.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-mouse CD3-eFluor 450 (clone: 17A2;

For intracellular staining, the following anti-mouse mAbs were used: TNFα-PE, Foxp3- and IFNγ-PE (eBioscience; San Diego, California, USA). Fc-block (anti-CD16/CD32 mAbs; eBioscience, San Diego, California, USA) was used both in surface and intracellular staining. For ELISA, matched anti-mouse capture mAb and biotinylated detection mAb against TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-12 and IL-6 were used (R&amp;D System, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA). Blocking anti-mouse CD25 (PC61.5), CD4 (GK1.5) and anti-IFN-γ (XMG1.2) mAbs, as well as anti-mIL-2 mAbs for preparing IL-2 complexes (S4B6, JES6-1A12), were obtained from BioXcell (Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>IL-2/JES6-1 and IL-2/S4B6 complexes</title><p>Complexes were prepared by mixing recombinant mouse IL-2 (Peprotech, Cranbury, New Jersey, USA) with anti-IL-2 mAb S4B6 or JES6-1A12 (both reagents were in PBS) at molar ratio 2:1.

Nikaido, University of California, Berkeley, USA) was first cultivated on agar (Nutrient agar nr.2, HiMedia Laboratories, Mumbai, India) in a petri dish and then transferred to an Erlenmayer flask with liquid media (150 ml, MRS Broth, Oxoid, Hampshire, UK). The bacterial culture was cultivated at 37 °C for up to 24 h (h) in order to reach the exponential growth phase according to measured OD ( ~ 5 × 10<sup>8</sup>/ml bacteria). Next, it was transferred to the solid substrate (12 g Nutrient agar nr.2, 3.5 g agar, 15 g glucose, 300 ml water) in 2 l glass cultivation bottles by Roux (4 ml inoculum/bottle). Bottles were cultured for 24 h at 37 °C. Bottles were washed with PBS and bacteria were removed from the surface of the substrate with a glass rod. The acquired suspension was filtered through the gauze, and bacteria were killed with 2% phenol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) in ethanol (96%; Lachner, Neratovice, Czech Republic) and deionized water at room temperature. Viability of the bacteria was tested by plating on a new agar petri dish (Nutrient agar nr.2, HiMedia Laboratories, Mumbai, India). Bacteria were sequentially centrifuged at 4600 and 16,000 rpm (room temperature, 20 min). They were washed once with PBS followed by a triple wash with deionized water to remove salts and phenol before they underwent lyophilization in order to get dry matter. Crude LPS was acquired from dry matter by fractionation. This was achieved by the addition of preheated phenol and deionized water at 68 °C (water bath) for 15 min while stirring constantly (20 g of dry matter + 350 ml deionized water and 350 ml 90% phenol). After incubation, the sample was cooled down to 4 °C and sequentially centrifuged at 4600 rpm and 16,000 rpm (4 °C, 20 min). The water phase (top part) was removed and stored whilst the pellet was subjected to a second round of fractionation. Water phases from both separations were pooled, shaken with diethylether (600 ml; Lachner, Neratovice, Czech Republic) and left overnight at 4 °C, followed by repeated dialysis of the water phase for 3–5 days (d) in a huge excess of deionized water. The whole process of crude LPS isolation was finalized by lyophilization. To achieve this, 0.76 g of crude LPS was dissolved in 50 ml of deionized water and cooled down to 4 °C. Next, 150 ml of ice-cold methanol (Lachner, Neratovice, Czech Republic) and 1.5 ml 20% MgCl<sub>2</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) were added and it was left stirring overnight. The following day, the solution was centrifuged at 5000 rpm (4 °C, 20 min) and the pellet was resuspended again in 50 ml of deionized water and cooled down to 4 °C. After this, 150 ml of ice-cold methanol was added and it was left stirring overnight. On the following day, the same procedure was repeated and the pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of deionized water. Pure LPS was finally lyophilized.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>LPS challenge in vivo</title><p>Mice were treated i.p. with IL-2/JES6-1 or IL-2/S4B6 complexes daily for 3 d (1.5 µg IL-2/mouse in 250 µl) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, unless stated otherwise.

One µg RNA treated with DNAse I (Turbo DNAse; Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) was reverse-transcribed using the Oligo(dT)12–18 primer and Superscript IV Reverse Transcriptase (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). To select suitable housekeeping genes, the gene expression stability was assessed using RefFinder (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.heartcure.com.au/reffinder/">https://www.heartcure.com.au/reffinder/</ext-link>). Evaluation of amplification efficiency was performed by dilution series of cDNA. qPCR (CFX96 TouchTM, Bio-Rad) was performed to determine the changes in the mRNA levels of TLR4. The cycling parameters were as follows: 4 min at 94 °C, 35 cycles of 10 s at 94 °C, 25 s at 58 °C, and a final extension for 7 min at 72 °C. Gene expression changes were calculated according to the 2−ΔΔCT (Livak) method. Two reference genes (<italic>Casc3, H6pd</italic>) were selected as the most stable internal controls for the normalization of the <italic>Tlr4</italic> gene expression.

We believe that the explanation why sensitization to LPS by IL-2 alone (free/native IL-2) is much weaker in comparison to IL-2/JES6, i.e. considerable extension of half-life <italic>and</italic> selectivity for CD25<sup>+</sup> cells (two separate features), is true and based on data shown within the manuscript. The fact that IL-2 has very short half-life (5 to 7 min in humans) is mentioned elsewhere and we decided to introduce a new reference into revised manuscript to support this statement (page 3, line 52). We employed IL-2 bound to synthetic water-soluble and fully biocompatible polymer carrier based on poly(<italic>N</italic>-(2-propyl)methacrylamide) (IL-2-pHPMA) in our study to dissect half-life extension feature and CD25<sup>+</sup> cell selectivity feature of IL-2/JES6. IL-2-pHPMA possesses much higher half-life in comparison to IL-2 and very similar to that of IL-2/JES6 (3-4 h; mentioned on page 7, line 140 including the reference to our publication where half-life of IL-2-pHPMA was determined, line 154) but lacks CD25<sup>+</sup> cell selectivity. IL-2-pHPMA showed more profound sensitization to LPS in comparison to IL-2 (Figure 2A and B) even when IL-2 was administered at much higher dosage (35 versus 1.5 µg/dose). This shows that prolongation of the half-life plays an important role. Nevertheless, sensitization to LPS via IL-2-pHPMA was not as robust as with IL-2/JES6 showing that selectivity for CD25<sup>+</sup> cells is also important. This was proved by the use of anti-CD25 mAb, which totally abolished sensitization to LPS via IL-2/JES6 (Figure 2E) and by comparison of sensitization to LPS via IL-2/JES6 and IL-2/S4B6 (CD25 independent IL-2 complex, i.e. the same half-life but different selectivity; Figure 1 B and D). Thus, we believe that this explanation supports our conclusion that both the extension of the half-life as well as selective stimulatory activity for CD25<sup>+</sup> cells are key features of IL-2/JES6 governing the sensitization to LPS.</p><p>IL-2/JES6 requires CD25 to be expressed on the cell surface in order to enable cells to utilize IL-2 from IL-2/JES6 complex. However, it is not completely true that IL-2/JES6 recruits IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ “rarely”. CD25 enables the dissociation of IL-2/JES6 complex via “peeling off” the IL-2 molecule from the JES6 antibody and binding the IL-2 (Spangler et al., <italic>Immunity</italic>, 42: 815-825, 2015; cited in the manuscript, page 4, line 75). Next, CD25-bound IL-2 engages IL-2Rβγ dimer to induce signaling. CD25 contains only short cytoplasmic tail with no motive to bind any signaling molecules (e.g. JAK kinases). Thus, IL-2/JES6 complex always utilizes IL-2Rβγ dimer to provide IL-2 signal to CD25<sup>+</sup> IL-2 responsive cells, however, after dissociation of the cytokine/antibody complex and transfer of the IL-2 to CD25 molecule. IL-2/JES6 complex is “invisible” for CD25 negative cells expressing only IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ since JES6 mAb binds to epitope in IL-2 molecule which almost completely overlaps with binding sites for IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ. This explains why IL-2/JES6 is so efficient in the stimulation of CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup> T cell proliferation: only CD25<sup>+</sup> cells are able to compete for IL-2 in the form of IL-2/JES6. Moreover, CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup> T cells are very keen to proliferate upon IL-2 signaling as shown by BrdU incorporation (Figure 4F and G). We do not presume that IL-2/JES6 induces CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup> T cells de novo (from CD25 negative T cells) but it rather potently expands already existing very tiny population of these cells (~ 0.1 %, Figure 4F and G). To make it clear, we decided to rephrase the sentence:</p><p>“Nevertheless, we found that administration of IL-2/JES6 gave rise to CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup> T cells in both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> subsets …….”</p><p>to the following one:</p><p>“Nevertheless, we found that administration of IL-2/JES6 potently expanded CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup> T cells in both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> subsets …….” (page 10, lines 228-231).</p><p>Further, we rephrased the sentence:</p><p>“We focused on CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells induced by IL-2/JES6 treatment”</p><p>as follows:</p><p>“We focused on CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells robustly expanded in the spleen of mice treated with IL-2/JES6.” (page 11, line 236-237).</p><p>We hope that this makes the issue more comprehensible for the readers and we are very sorry for a confusing statement in the previous version of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The transient nature of the IL-2/JES6-1 complex-induced sensitization to LPS (Figure 1C) is an interesting observation that was not followed up on and why does this occur?</p></disp-quote><p>The study on kinetics of sensitization to LPS via IL-2/JES6 was performed to determine whether the standard time schedule selected for LPS administration (Figure 1A) in ongoing experiments is appropriate in terms of maximal sensitivity to LPS. The experiment shown in Figure 1C confirmed that administration of LPS 2 days after the last dose IL-2/JES6 is still at the plateau of the maximal sensitivity to LPS. Thus, this kinetics experiment provided us a clear answer to our question and we did not see any need to continue in this kind of experiments (however, we completely agree with the reviewer that the observation is interesting). We think that the transient nature of the IL-2/JES6-induced sensitization to LPS could be explained by short-term duration of IFN-γ production (predominantly by CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells) upon IL-2/JES6 administration and sensitization of myeloid cells (increased in counts in IL-2/JES6 treated mice) to LPS by such produced IFN-γ. Thus, the production of IFN-γ probably rapidly diminishes after the last dose of IL-2/JES6 leading to the loss of increased sensitivity to LPS after about 4 days as shown in Figure 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The examination of TLR4 expression on different immune cell population following IL-2/JES6-1 complex administration would be telling, for example, Is the increased sensitivity to LPS due to increased number of cells (such as myeloid cells) responsive to LPS or increased TLR4 expression or both?</p></disp-quote><p>We definitely agree with the reviewer that it would be useful to investigate TLR4 expression on LPS responsive cells upon IL-2/JES6 treatment. Thus, we treated B6 mice with IL-2/JES6 or IL-2/S4B6 as shown in the Figure 1A and analyzed first the <italic>Tlr4</italic> expression in splenocytes of these mice by quantitative RT-PCR. We found that neither treatment affected the expression of <italic>Tlr4</italic> on mRNA level. Next, we analyzed TLR4 expression in various subsets of myeloid cells from the spleen of B6 mice treated as described above via flow cytometry. Surprisingly, we found decent but still statistically significant decrease of TLR4 levels in CD11b<sup>+</sup>Ly6G<sup>+</sup> (granulocytes) and CD11b<sup>+</sup>Ly6G<sup>-</sup>Ly6C<sup>low</sup> cells upon IL-2/JES6 treatment in comparison to controls. No statistically significant difference in TLR4 level upon IL-2/JES6 treatment in comparison to controls was found in CD11b<sup>+</sup>Ly6G<sup>-</sup>Ly6C<sup>high</sup> cells (monocytes/macrophages). Thus, we conclude that increased sensitivity of B6 mice treated with IL-2/JES6 to LPS is not due to the increased TLR4 expression but rather due to the increased counts of cells responsive to LPS as shown in the manuscript. The results described above are now included in the revised version of the manuscript (Figure 3 —figure supplement 4 and 5). We also added the following text (page 9, lines 185-194):</p><p>“We asked a question whether this increased responsiveness of myeloid cells to LPS was due to the increased expression of TLR4. Thus, we analyzed <italic>Tlr4</italic> expression in spleen cells via quantitative RT-PCR and in various myeloid cell subsets via flow cytometry. Treatment with IL-2/JES6 did not affect the <italic>Tlr4</italic> expression in splenocytes on mRNA level (Figure 3 —figure supplement 4). No statistically significant difference in TLR4 level upon IL-2/JES6 treatment in comparison to control was found in CD11b<sup>+</sup>Ly6G<sup>-</sup>Ly6C<sup>high</sup> cells. Surprisingly, IL-2/JES6 treatment decently but statistically significantly decreased TLR4 levels in CD11b<sup>+</sup>Ly6G<sup>+</sup> cells and CD11b<sup>+</sup>Ly6G<sup>-</sup>Ly6C<sup>low</sup>cells (Figure 3 —figure supplement 5). IL-2/JES6 thus did not increased the sensitivity to LPS via increased expression of TLR4.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. A more detailed examination of the myeloid cells in Figure 3 is required, to define if these cells are monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, or another cell type?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and we completely agree that a more detailed examination of the myeloid cells expanded in response to IL-2/JES6 administration would improve the manuscript. Thus, we performed an experiment where we treated B6 mice with IL-2/JES6 or IL-2/S4B6 as shown in the Figure 1A and analyzed the myeloid cells from the spleen by flow cytometry 2 d after the last dose of IL-2 complexes (at time when LPS is injected in other experiments). We also confirmed proliferation of myeloid cells upon various single doses of IL-2/JES6 via BrdU incorporation. These results are now included in revised version of the manuscript (Figure 3 —figure supplements 1, 2 and 3). We also added the following text (page 8, lines 173-179):</p><p>“We also found that treatment with IL-2/JES6 expands myeloid cells in general. IL-2/JES6 expanded significantly granulocytes, eosinophils and DCs and elevated, though not significantly, relative counts of monocytes and macrophages (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1). Of note, treatment with IL-2/JES6 increased MHC II expression on monocytes and macrophages (Figure 3 —figure supplement 2). The proliferation of myeloid cells driven by IL-2/JES6 was further confirmed by BrdU incorporation (Figure 3 —figure supplement 3).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 4 F-G demonstrates the effect of IL-2/JES6-1 complex on the T cell compartment, however, this only assesses the proliferative response of these cells. The focus on the CD25+Foxp3- CD4 and CD8 T cells in Figure 5 is not well justified. What happens to the number of CD25+Foxp3+ CD4 T cells?</p></disp-quote><p>The primary purpose we show Figure 4F and G is to demonstrate that treatment with IL-2/JES6 dramatically expands CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (originally very tiny population representing ~ 0.1 % of these T cell subsets, respectively) through potent stimulation of their proliferation as shown by BrdU incorporation assay. These cells proliferate even more vigorously in response to IL-2/JES6 than T<sub>reg</sub> cells as shown in Figure 4F and G (mentioned in the manuscript, page 10, lines 228-231). Such finding was made for the first time in the spleen and later on the robust expansion of CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells after IL-2/JES6 treatment was found also in other (non-lymphoid) organs, particularly in the liver and lungs (shown in the Figure 5A and B). We agree with the reviewer that focus on CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was not well justified in the previous version of our manuscript. Thus, we rewrote the beginning of Results section “IL-2/JES6 drive expansion of CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup> T cells producing IFN-γ in lymphoid as well as non-lymphoid tissues” as follows (page 11, lines 236-240):</p><p>“We focused on CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells robustly expanded in the spleen of mice treated with IL-2/JES6. Since these cells resemble by their phenotype activated T cells, we presumed that these cells could be a key producers of IFN-γ in IL-2/JES6 treated mice causing the increased sensitivity to LPS. Thus, we decided to investigate whether these cells were expanded also in other organs except of spleen and whether they produced IFN-γ.”</p><p>The reviewer also asked what happens to the number of CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (i.e. T<sub>reg</sub> cells)? T<sub>reg</sub> cells are also significantly expanded by IL-2/JES6 as shown in Figure 5A, left part of the graph (though the percentage of CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population is not shown) via stimulation of their proliferation (Figure 4F, BrdU incorporation assay part of the panel). The treatment with IL-2/JES6 (using the schedule and dosage shown in Figure 1A) usually expands T<sub>reg</sub> cells in the spleen to about 25-45 % out of total CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. The corresponding number in the liver and spleen is about 10-20 %.</p><p>Surprisingly, T<sub>reg</sub> cells were found also to produce IFN-γ in mice treated with IL-2/JES6, particularly in the liver (Figure 5C and D, middle part of the graphs). This is mentioned in the Results (page 11, lines 251-253) and also in the Discussion (page 14, lines 320-322) where we hypothesize why T<sub>reg</sub> cells upon IL-2/JES6 administration produce IFN-γ, which is rather unusual and surprising feature of these cells. However, the fraction of IFN-γ producing T<sub>reg</sub> cells was significantly smaller in comparison to that found in CD25<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Altogether, we conclude that T<sub>reg</sub> cells upon IL-2/JES6 administration participate to IFN-γ production in the organism and thus to LPS hypersensitivity, however, the key producers are CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

The data in Figure 6 A-C should demonstrate that potentially any T cells producing IFN-γ, if present in the body at sufficiently high numbers, are capable of sensitization to LPS. We wanted to mimic the situation there is a high number of IFN-γ producing T cells but without the use of IL-2/JES6. Thus, we first show clonal expansion of OT-I CD8<sup>+</sup> and OT-II CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells after adoptive transfer into congeneic Ly5.1 mice and treatment of mice with respective cognate peptides plus polyI:C. These cells formed approximately 8 and 4 % of total CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells after their expansion, respectively, and their clonal expansion was not affected by injection of anti-IFN-γ mAb (Figure 6 A and B). These cells should moreover produce IFN-γ due to the TCR stimulation in the presence of adjuvant. Next, we demonstrate that mice with adoptively transferred OT-I CD8<sup>+</sup> and OT-II CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and stimulated with cognate peptides plus polyI:C, but not unstimulated ones, are sensitized to LPS (Figure 6C). Importantly, injection of anti-IFN-γ mAb abrogated the sensitization to LPS. It is true that the number of transferred OT-I CD8<sup>+</sup> and OT-II CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells enormously exceeds the number of endogenous OVA-specific T cells (however, it was done intentionally). The reviewer asks what happens to naïve mice immunize with OVA that do not receive any OT-I CD8<sup>+</sup> and OT-II CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells? To answer this question, we performed an experiment where we immunized B6 mice with OVA (0.5 mg/mice i.p.) plus poly I:C (75 µg/mice i.p.) and challenged with LPS 4 d after immunization. Positive controls were treated with IL-2/JES6 as in Figure 1A and Control mice were injected with PBS. As expected, mice immunized with OVA plus poly I:C showed no sensitization to LPS. This result is included in the revised version of the manuscript (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1). We also included following sentence into revised version of the manuscript (page 12, lines 271-273):</p><p>“C56BL/6 mice without adoptively transferred CD8<sup>+</sup> OT-I and CD4<sup>+</sup> OT-II T cells and immunized with OVA plus polyI:C showed no increased sensitivity to LPS (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1).”</p><p>The other question of the reviewer was whether T cells could be directly stimulated by LPS and that we should transfer <italic>Tlr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> T cells to see what happens. To address this issue, we did an experiment where we employed <italic>Myd88</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. We used these mice since we had <italic>Tlr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice available on BALB/c background but not on C57BL/6 background. Since the experiment required the transfer of T cells, which would be capable of producing substantial levels of IFN-γ, we decided not to use <italic>Tlr4</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice on BALB/c background since BALB/c mice are known to be a poor IFN-γ responders (contrary to C57BL/6 mice which are a high IFN-γ responders). This is reflected also in sensitization to LPS via IL-2/JES6 as BALB/c mice are sensitized much weaker in comparison to B6 mice (Figure 4B versus Figure 1B). <italic>Myd88</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice have severely impaired TLR4 downstream signaling; only TRIF signaling pathway leading to IRF3 activation is functional whereas IRAK and <italic>TAK1</italic> signaling pathways essential for activation of NF-κB and AP-1 are abrogated. It has been demonstrated that <italic>Myd88</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice are unresponsive to LPS (Kawai et al., Immunity, 11: 115-122, 1999) and thereby we considered them as convenient model for our experiment. Thus, we treated <italic>Myd88</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice on C57BL/6 background for 3 consecutive days with IL-2/JES6 in order to expand CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup> T cells (and similarly to experiment using nude mice shown in Figure 4E). Mice were euthanized 1 d after the last dose and T cells were purified from their spleens and lymph nodes by MACS (using negative selection). T cells were adoptively transferred (5.6 x 10<sup>6</sup> per mice) into <italic>Rag1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice and the mice were either left untreated or were treated with IL-2/JES6 as in Figure 1A. <italic>Rag1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice without adoptively transferred T cells either treated with IL-2/JES6 or untreated (Control) were also involved. All experimental groups were challenged with LPS. We found that mice with adoptively transferred T cells and treated with IL-2/JES6 (but no any other groups) showed profound sensitivity to LPS demonstrating that even T cells unable to respond to LPS sensitizes the mice when stimulated with IL-2/JES6. This finding is included in revised version of the manuscript (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1). We also included following sentence into revised version of the manuscript (page 10, lines 221-224):</p><p>“TLR4 expression on T cells seems to be irrelevant for their ability to sensitize the mice to LPS since <italic>Rag1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice with adoptively transferred T cells from <italic>Myd88</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, i.e. with severely impaired TLR4 downstream signaling, showed profound LPS sensitivity upon treatment with IL-2/JES6 (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. IL-2 treatment had a toxic side effect, especially as an inducer of vascular leak syndrome (VLS). Vascular leakage is also attributed to LPS and IFNγ inflammatory response. Did the authors consider showing a manifestation of VLS in the lungs of mice treated with IL2/JES6 compared to other treatments? Showing, or describing previous work, the outcome of this well-documented phenomena following the injection of IL2/JES6 will give a clinical significance to the findings presented.</p></disp-quote><p>IL-2 treatment causes vascular leak syndrome (VLS) accompanied by lung oedema, indeed. Lung oedema was described to be a serious side toxicity in IL-2-treated patients and also in mice treated with IL-2 or IL-2/anti-IL-2 mAb complexes. We completely agree with the reviewer that showing lung oedema in mice treated with IL-2/JES6 in comparison to IL-2/S4B6 treated mice (i.e. comparison of IL-2 complex inducing high LPS sensitivity versus IL-2 complex inducing only decent LPS sensitivity) would improve the manuscript and provide clinical significance to our findings. Thus, we performed an experiment where we injected the B6 mice with either IL-2/JES6 or IL-2/S4B6 using schedule and dosage shown in Figure 1A. Mice were euthanized 1 d after the last dose of IL-2 complexes and wet weight of their lungs was determined. The result recapitulates the previously described finding (Krieg et al., PNAS, 109: 11906-1191, 2012) that both IL-2 complexes induce lung oedema but IL-2/JES6 do it significantly more vigorously. This data is now included in the revised version of the manuscript (Figure 1 —figure supplement 2) and mentioned in the Discussion (page 16, lines 368-371):</p><p>“Further, treatment with IL-2/JES6 <italic>per se</italic> induces more severe lung oedema in comparison to treatment with IL-2/S4B6, which could contribute to the morbidity and mortality after LPS challenge to some extent (Figure 1 —figure supplement 2).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
