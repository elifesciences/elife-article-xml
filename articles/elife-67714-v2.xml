GnRH promotes fertility via increasing the synthesis and secretion of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone in the anterior pituitary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Herbison, 2018</xref>). Unlike other neurons of the central nervous system, GnRH neurons are born in the olfactory placodes and migrate into the forebrain prenatally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Casoni et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schwanzel-Fukuda and Pfaff, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wray et al., 1989</xref>). Recent developmental studies on embryos/fetuses determined the detailed spatio-temporal profile of this process in the human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Casoni et al., 2016</xref>). Approximately 2000 neurons were observed along a ventral migratory path whereby GnRH neurons reach the hypothalamus to regulate reproduction after puberty. In addition, a previously unknown dorsal migratory route has been identified whereby ~8000 GnRH neurons migrated towards pallial and/or subpallial structures. The fate of these neurons at later stages of pre- and postnatal development has been unexplored so far.</p><p>While GnRH neurons in adult laboratory rodents are mostly preoptic/hypothalamic and serve reproductive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Merchenthaler et al., 1980</xref>), a handful of anatomical studies on primates identified additional <italic>GNRH1</italic> mRNA expression and/or GnRH immunoreactivity in extrahypothalamic regions unrelated to reproduction. These included several basal ganglia and the basal forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Krajewski et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Quanbeck et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rance et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Terasawa et al., 2001</xref>). Initial enthusiasm to study these neurons further faded after suggestions that extrahypothalamic GnRH neurons in monkeys contain the GnRH degradation product GnRH1-5, instead of the <italic>bona fide</italic> GnRH decapeptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Quanbeck et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Terasawa et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Here, we study human extrahypothalamic GnRH neurons in adult <italic>postmortem</italic> brains with immunohistochemistry (IHC), in situ hybridization (ISH), single-cell transcriptomics (RNA-seq), and high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). We report and characterize a previously unexplored large GnRH neuron population with ~150,000–200,000 cell bodies scattered in different basal ganglia and the basal forebrain. Extrahypothalamic GnRH neurons, most of which are found in the putamen (Pu), contain <italic>bona fide</italic> GnRH decapeptide, as shown by HPLC-MS/MS. Deep transcriptome analysis reveals that these neurons express GnRH biosynthetic enzymes, <italic>GNRHR1</italic> autoreceptors, and the molecular machinery of cholinergic and GABAergic co-transmission. Somewhat unexpectedly, hypothalamic GnRH neurons also exhibit cholinergic phenotype in the embryonic and adult human brains. Altogether, these data indicate that GnRH is synthesized as a co-transmitter of many cholinergic neurons in the human basal ganglia and basal forebrain. At least in the Pu, GnRH appears to act on GnRHR1 autoreceptors to regulate higher-order non-reproductive functions associated with the cholinergic system.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Human extrahypothalamic GnRH-immunoreactive neurons occur in the basal ganglia and the basal forebrain</title><p>The primate central nervous system contains extrahypothalamic GnRH cell populations, which have unknown functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Krajewski et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Quanbeck et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rance et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Terasawa et al., 2001</xref>).

To investigate the possibility that GnRH neurons in the basal ganglia and the basal forebrain of the adult human brain use GnRH1-5, rather than GnRH decapeptide for signaling, we first tested a series of polyclonal antibodies against human GnRH-associated peptide (hGAP1) or GnRH decapeptide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) for their reactivity with GnRH neurons of the human Pu (N = 10; #5, 6, and 12–19).

Third, they showed immunoreactivity to the THOP1 enzyme, which can cleave GnRH at the Tyr5-Gly6 position, although notably, they did not differ from hypothalamic GnRH neurons in this latter respect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Terasawa et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>In contrast with the above suggestion, our results indicate that the human Pu and Cd contain mostly <italic>bona fide</italic> GnRH decapeptide because (1) human ChINs can be immunolabeled with the LR-1 antibodies and several other GAP1 and GnRH antibodies, unlike extrahypothalamic neurons of the monkey. (2) They possess the full enzyme set of GnRH biosynthesis, as revealed by deep transcriptome profiling. Finally, (3) human Pu extracts contain 3–4-times as much uncleaved GnRH decapeptide as GnRH1-5, as shown by results of HPLC-MS/MS studies. Different conclusion from the monkey and human studies may reflect species differences and the use of different methodological approaches.</p><p>We note that the human genome includes a fully functional <italic>GNRH2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stewart et al., 2009</xref>), in addition to <italic>GNRH1</italic>.

Indeed, we found that GnRH1-5 was also detectable with HPLC-MS/MS in the <italic>postmortem</italic> Pu and Cd, albeit at ~70% lower levels than GnRH. Transcriptomic studies revealed that one of the putative GnRH1-5 receptors, <italic>GPR101</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cho-Clark et al., 2014</xref>), was expressed at high levels in SPNs (mean cpm: 58.4) and at low levels in ChINs (mean cpm: 6.4) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). This differential expression suggests that if GnRH1-5 is a physiological neurotransmitter of human ChINs, it may regulate SPNs via GPR101. We note that <italic>THOP1</italic> expression in ChINs is not a strong proof for the transmitter role of GnRH1-5. This endopeptidase has many substrates unrelated to GnRH degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Orlowski et al., 1983</xref>). Further, in RNA-seq studies, <italic>THOP1</italic> was expressed at higher levels in SPNs than in ChINs.

For technical reasons, our calculation could even underestimate the real number of GnRH neurons. <italic>Perimortem</italic> and <italic>postmortem</italic> conditions could be suboptimal in some samples to achieve maximal detection sensitivity. In addition, the use of 100-µm-thick sections for IHC could also compromise the detection of low signal levels via reducing antibody penetration. Rance and coworkers identified 5800 type III GnRH neurons in the human basal forebrain complex rostral to the mammillary bodies, caudal to the optic chiasm, and ventral to the anterior commissure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rance et al., 1994</xref>). This low cell number may reflect that tissues with these anatomical guidelines are devoid of the bulk of the Pu, which contained the majority (82%) of the extrahypothalamic GnRH neurons in our study.</p><p>Our initial hypothesis was that extrahypothalamic GnRH neurons are derived from the ~8000 GnRH neurons reported recently along the dorsal migratory route during embryonic/fetal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Casoni et al., 2016</xref>). The placodal origin now seems to be very unlikely considering the much larger GnRH cell numbers we observed in the adult brain.</p><p>Extrahypothalamic GnRH neurons of the human central nervous system also appear to be homologous to the ‘early type’ GnRH neurons reported in the developing monkey embryo and fetus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Quanbeck et al., 1997</xref>). In this species, the ‘early’ and ‘late’ types of GnRH neurons were distinguished based on differences in their time of appearance, morphology, and immunoreactivity pattern using GnRH antibodies against different GnRH epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Quanbeck et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Terasawa et al., 2001</xref>). It was speculated that early GnRH neurons originated from the dorsal olfactory placode before olfactory pit formation at E30, migrated into the brain along the olfactory nerve, and settled in striatal and limbic structures of the fetal brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Quanbeck et al., 1997</xref>). However, in a subsequent study these authors noted that a 10- to 10,000-fold increase in the number of ‘early’ GnRH neurons in the basal forebrain within just a few days indicates that early GnRH neurons might rather be derived from the ventricular wall of the telencephalic vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Terasawa et al., 2001</xref>). The possibility of non-placodal GnRH neuron development is compatible with the in vitro capability of hypothalamic and hippocampal progenitors to generate GnRH cells and all other neuroendocrine cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Markakis et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>It is worth noting that our RNA-seq studies provided transcriptomic information about a mixed ChIN population of the Pu, whereas ChINs exhibit substantial diversity in their physiology, morphology, and connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gonzales and Smith, 2015</xref>). Subclasses differ in their developmental origin (medial ganglionic eminence, septal epithelium, or preoptic area) and transcription factor profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed et al., 2019</xref>). It is unknown which ChIN subpopulation expresses <italic>GNRH1</italic> and <italic>GNRHR1</italic> because selective harvesting of well-preserved cellular RNA specifically from the GnRH-IR ChINs is currently unresolved. Development of an ‘immuno-LCM/RNA-seq’ method would also allow us to compare the gene expression profiles of hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic GnRH neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Both hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic GnRH neurons use cholinergic co-transmission</title><p>ChAT co-expression provided evidence that extrahypothalamic GnRH neurons correspond to subpopulations of previously known cholinergic cells. These include ChINs of the Pu, which communicate locally with SPNs as well as projection neurons of the nbM, which innervate distant limbic structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed et al., 2019</xref>). Although ChAT emerged as a hallmark of the extrahypothalamic GnRH system, we found evidence that a relatively large subset of human hypothalamic GnRH neurons also express the cholinergic marker enzyme. To our knowledge, this colocalization phenomenon has not been reported in any other species before. Studies on GW11 human fetuses established that migratory GnRH neurons in the nasal compartment are not cholinergic, whereas both hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic GnRH neurons already express the ChAT signal at this age.</p><p>Rodent GnRH neurons are regulated by cholinergic afferents but not known to co-express cholinergic markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Turi et al., 2008</xref>). To address the possibility that the cholinergic phenotype of murine GnRH neurons has only been overlooked in previous studies, we have recently tried to detect ChAT immunoreactivity in GnRH neurons of the mouse preoptic area. The lack of success of this attempt (Skrapits et al., unpublished) suggests that the cholinergic phenotype of GnRH neurons is a true species difference between humans and rodents.</p><p>Laser microdissection of size-selected ChINs and SPNs is a highly efficient approach for transcriptome profiling of the two cell types from the <italic>postmortem</italic> brain.</p><p>Deep transcriptome profiling of <italic>postmortem</italic> human neurons is technically challenging. Difficulties include (1) compromised RNA quality, (2) lack of obvious marker signals to distinguish cell types, and (3) low RNA yield from the LCM-isolated 300–600 neurons. Our strategy to isolate size-selected ChINs and SPNs with LCM was justified by the RNA-seq results, which showed high enrichment of known cell type-specific marker genes in the two cell pools and millions of reads in each. As one-third of ChINs in the Pu also contain GnRH, deep transcriptome profiling of ChINs offered an insight into the extrahypothalamic GnRH neuron transcriptome. Although it was beyond the focus of our study, RNA-sequencing of ChINs and SPNs also unveiled the neurotransmitter and receptor profiles of the two cell types and provided information about the putative molecular interactions taking place in the Pu. The transcriptome databases allowed us to propose putative peptidergic mechanisms and, thus, build the partial molecular connectome model of ChINs and SPNs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>GnRH acts outside the hypothalamus to regulate various reproductive and non-reproductive functions</title><p>Clearly, the functions of GnRH are far from being restricted to the regulation of hypophysial gonadotropin secretion. Its receptor transcript, <italic>GNRHR1,</italic> is expressed in normal peripheral endocrine tissues including the uterus, placenta, ovaries, testes, and prostate gland as well as in various tumor cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harrison et al., 2004</xref>). High levels of <italic>GNRHR1</italic> mRNA and immunoreactivity were reported in pyramidal neurons of the human hippocampus and cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wilson et al., 2006</xref>). GnRH analogues were anti-apoptotic in a rat model of ischemia/reperfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chu et al., 2010</xref>). Further, GnRH increased hippocampal estradiol levels and the spontaneous firing and <italic>GNRHR1</italic> expression of pyramidal neurons and prevented memory deficits caused by amyloid β deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marbouti et al., 2020</xref>). While the source of GnRH acting on hippocampal neurons remains to be explored, results of our studies indicate that GnRHR1 in ChINs of the basal ganglia can bind locally synthesized GnRH neuropeptide. ChINs of the striatum contribute as interneurons to the regulation of cortico-striato-thalamocortical neural pathways. Functions associated with this circuitry include motor control, learning, language, reward, cognitive function, and addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fazl and Fleisher, 2018</xref>). The exact role of GnRH/GnRHR1 signaling in these functions requires clarification. We note that various GABAergic interneurons of the Pu not studied here may also express GnRHR1 to serve as additional target cells for GnRH signaling by ChINs. Cholinergic neurons of the nbM, which project to the entire cortical mantle, olfactory tubercle, and amygdala, have been implicated in the control of attention, maintenance of arousal, and learning and memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koulousakis et al., 2019</xref>). It remains to be determined if GnRH synthesized by these neurons binds to postsynaptic target cells or acts on autoreceptors, as we proposed for striatal ChINs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Receptor profile of human cholinergic interneurons may offer new therapeutic targets to treat neurodegenerative disorders</title><p>In the absence of animal models, it is currently difficult to estimate the role and importance of GnRH/GnRHR1 signaling in the human basal ganglia and basal forebrain.

Leading symptoms and cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease are due to the loss of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons many of which exhibited GnRH immunoreactivity in nbM. Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by motor symptoms such as abnormal involuntary movements, bradykinesia, rigidity, gait, and tremor. Non-motor symptoms often include cognitive impairment, mood disorders, sleep alterations, dysautonomia, anosmia, and hallucinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Perez-Lloret and Barrantes, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tubert and Murer, 2021</xref>). Many of these malfunctions in PD can be explained with the loss of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic input and ameliorated with levodopa. However, gait disorders and cognitive impairment/dementia are most often unresponsive to dopamine precursor treatment. These data indicate the involvement of other neurotransmitter systems. In particular, loss of striatal dopamine input causes a local hypercholinergic state in the striatum with consequences reviewed recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tubert and Murer, 2021</xref>). This hypercholinergic state explains the success of early PD therapies with <italic>Atropa belladonna</italic> derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goetz, 2011</xref>). Although the low efficacy of anticholinergic drugs compared to levodopa and unwanted side effects limit the use of general anticholinergic strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Katzenschlager et al., 2003</xref>), selective inhibition of striatal ChINs has been proposed recently as a more promising strategy to improve the transmitter balance in dopamine-deprived basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mallet et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tubert and Murer, 2021</xref>). An important physiological mechanism to inhibit acetylcholine release from ChINs is via M2-type (M2 and M4) muscarinic autoreceptors coupled to G<sub>i</sub> proteins. Accordingly, deletion of M2-type autoreceptors results in increased striatal acetylcholine release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonsi et al., 2008</xref>). Autoinhibitory mechanism by muscarinic autoreceptors was found to be lost in PD animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ding et al., 2006</xref>).

EÜM Decree/) and the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki. As explicitly declared in the Hungarian Law on Healthcare (1997. CLIV), tissue removal for either donation or research purposes can be done legally in Hungary, unless the deceased person banned the removal in advance. Therefore, collection and use of adult brain samples in this study did not require a priori informed consent of the deceased. The above cited legal article has been extended in 18/1998. (XII. 27. EÜM rendelet) decree of the Hungarian Ministry for Healthcare http://net.jogtar.hu/jr/gen/hjegy_doc.cgi?docid=99800018.EUM. Paragraph 6. speaks about requirements for &quot;Removal of organ or tissue from a cadaver&quot;. Paragraph 8. states: Before removal the healthcare professional must check whether the personal documents or health care documentation of deceased person contains a &quot;Declaration of Objection&quot;, i.e. explicit statement that he/she does not allow the removal of tissue or organs. In paragraph 8. (3): If such declaration does not exist, then the tissue or organs can be removed. The later Hungarian Law 1999. LXXI. also addresses this issue in the very same spirit: https://mkogy.jogtar.hu/jogszabaly?docid=99900071.TV Fetal tissues were made available in accordance with French bylaws (Good Practice Concerning the Conservation, Transformation, and Transportation of Human Tissue to Be Used Therapeutically, published on December 29, 1998). The studies on human fetal tissue were approved by the French agency for biomedical research (Agence de la Biomédecine, Saint-Denis la Plaine, France, protocol n°: PFS16-002). Non-pathological human fetuses were obtained at gestational week 11 from pregnancies terminated voluntarily after written informed consent of the parents (Gynaecology Department, Jeanne de Flandre Hospital, Lille, France).</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn2"><p>Animal experimentation: Experiments involving genetically modified male mice were carried out in accordance with the Institutional Ethical Codex, Hungarian Act of Animal Care and Experimentation (1998, XXVIII, section 243/1998) and the European Union guidelines (directive 2010/63/EU), and with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Institute of Experimental Medicine. All measures were taken to minimize potential stress or suffering during sacrifice and to reduce the number of animals to be used.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6"

It has been long known that a small population of neurons expressing GnRH in the hypothalamus are central to the onset of puberty and control of adult fertility in both sexes. Here the authors report on a second much larger population of GnRH neurons in a brain region often damaged in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. They further report these same neurons express traditional neurotransmitters associated with those diseases, suggesting a novel role for this reproduction-associated peptide.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The cryptic gonadotropin-releasing hormone neuronal system of human basal ganglia&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Tony Plant (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In discussion between the 3 reviewers and reviewing editor it was agreed that the inclusion of data from the mouse model was more detrimental that beneficial and it is recommended it be removed. This is based on the following specific comments: The electrophysiology data in Figure 3 and the Supplementary file are insufficient to assess the quality and outcomes of the studies. No quality parameters such as access resistance or input resistance are provided. Cholinergic neurons are often spontaneously active, so it is difficult to understand why these neurons are reported to be quiescent. Because of the high chloride pipette solution used, all GABA A dependent input that has developed at the age studied will be depolarizing and this adds to the confusion. It is possible the initial membrane potential of these cells is too depolarized for them fire because of inactivation of sodium channels.</p><p>To evaluate treatment effects, raw values of membrane potential before and during treatment and washout should be provided in the Supplementary files at minimum and preferably also in figures rather than percent changes. Initial membrane potential needs to be provided on the figures. There are no controls without GnRH application and the initial firing rate in Antide in the example shown is lower so that is difficult to use as a comparator. The lowering of firing rate over time could be due to the very long acclimatization to the whole cell configuration, this could lead currents involved in action potential generation to run down. How data were divided for assessment of firing rate is not indicated. The possibility of dose-dependent changes in the effects of GnRH were not examined and is needed before a purely inhibitory role can be assumed given the GnRH receptor can also couple via Gq, which is typically excitatory.</p><p>Perhaps it would be worth the minimal effort to examine whether GnRH neurons in the adult mouse hypothalamus express ChAT. It is stated that such a relationship is not seen in other species but it is unclear whether this is because of negative results or ChAT expression has not been examined.</p><p>While I admit that the mouse data are intriguing, direct extrapolation of mouse results to human biology should require more caution. In the human studies, a persistent GnRH population is detected in the striatum of adult individuals, while in the GnRH-GFP mouse, the expression of GFP is transient and actual expression of GnRH is not demonstrated. However, this sets the basis for electrophysiological recordings, whose relevance in terms of human neuronal control is far from clear. Even the fact that Gi components are detected in putative GnRH/ChIN neurons isolated in human brains does not demonstrate the inhibitory nature of the potential GnRH transmission. Admittedly, functional studies in human material are not doable and the use of animal models is a reasonable approach. However, it is not clear to this referee that the mouse data presented here provide a solid back up for the human data, and it is less evident that this should be taken as evidence for an inhibitory action of GnRH in the human striatum, in normal or pathological conditions. Please consider these comments, and edit the presentation and/or discussion of data accordingly.</p><p>2) The antisera used were polyclonal and the possibility of overlapping signal produced by a non-decapeptide epitope remains. Because of the striking nature of the claim of over 100-fold more GnRH neurons that previously detected, an additional control of staining with antibodies preabsorbed against the decapeptide form is worth conducting. Related to this, inclusion of data on the expression of THOP1 enzyme that produces this cleavage product in their RNAseq data in addition to the supporting data provided that the biosynthetic enzymes needed to produce the full decapeptide (lines 355-6) or clarification that those lines do include information on the expression THOP1 endopeptidase would facilitate interpretation. A brief statement of what depth color coding accomplishes would be useful to non-expert readers as would discussion of why peptide might not fill processes of these cells as it does for the hypothalamic population. Pre-absorption validation of antibody #1018 should be conducted and presented. Also a low power photomicrograph of the putamen with identifying landmarks and immunostained for GnRH might be included to support the schematic in Figure 1A</p><p>3) Initial description of results indicate that anatomical analyses for identification of GnRH neurons was done in three individuals, which are not outright identified. Later, other analyses are applied to other independent samples from other donors. While all the info is detailed in Suppl. Figure 4, which reports a total of 28 individuals in the brain collection, it is suggested the authors make extra-efforts to emphasize how representative the findings are for humans, considering the multiple variables occurring (sex, age, condition, etc.). On the later, were all subjects studied excluded for neurological disease?</p><p>4) For the RNAseq, the RIN numbers are somewhat low, and may have contributed to the need for adding an extra cycle for their library creation. The sequencing depth is also adequate but not strong, again likely attributable to the difficulty of this tissue. This should be adequate for a snapshot of presence detection, although one control sample (SPN22) has much lower reads. Notably the expression of GnRH receptor, which is key to their conclusions, is barely above their apparent level of detection at &gt; 5CPM, thus interpretation of these data mandates caution. Inclusion of the sequencing data for the ChIN and SPN marker data would add rigor and also provide the reader with a better idea of the CPM level that can be interpreted. Figure 4 suggests the marker genes are all &gt;60CPM, thelist of &quot;classical receptors&quot; only has 4 (of 77) with average CPM below 5, but the &quot;other receptors&quot; have 67 genes with &lt;5CPM (out of 534) and GNRHR is just &gt;5CPM for the ChIN samples and zero for the SPN. It is also strongly suggested to include the CPM for all the mapped genes in their build (GRCh38.p13).</p><p>5) Based on cell numbers and morphology, it is concluded that basal ganglia GnRH neurons have a different origin than hypothalamic GnRH neurons. However, both hypothalamic and extra-hypothalamic GnRH neurons appear to be cholinergic. Did the authors consider performing deep sequencing of hypothalamic GnRH neurons to identify similarities and differences between these two neuronal populations? This may help to better define the differential origin and functional features of these two neuronal sets.</p><p>6) The authors openly discuss the fact that the existence of extra-hypothalamic GnRH neuronal populations had been previously defined by pioneering work by Rance and coworkers in 1990's. Admittedly, the present study discloses a much larger population of GnRH neurons, and applies modern technologies to phenotype them. Considering that the previous work identified a much smaller set of extra-hypothalamic GnRH neurons, could the authors speculate why they think this rather large set of GnRH neurons was not identified in that previous study? Was it just because the previous study did not evaluate the striatum? Or was this due to technical limitations of the previous studies?</p><p>7) While the present results open numerous questions, the functional implications of the data, in terms of human physiology and pathophysiology, are rather open and the extensive discussion of this issue makes the paper a bit over-speculative. In the same vein, the possibility that GnRH might be considered a useful therapy to neurodegenerative disorders is not sufficiently based on actual data, even considering the mouse results. Application of GnRH analogs is not devoid of potential side-effects and even may suffer desensitization, which makes this possibility quite speculative. I would suggest this sections is markedly shorten if not eliminated.</p><p>8) The Discussion is fragmented into multiple sub-sections. While in some cases this is useful to follow the line of reasoning and major conclusions, in other instances, the sub-sections are rather short and mainly recapitulate the Results section. I would suggest that the authors try to integrate the multiple subsections into 2-3 major pieces, so the Discussion appears more fluent and cohesive.</p><p>9) Line 72-73 that &quot;GnRH acts on GnRHR1 autoreceptors to regulate higher order non-reproductive functions &quot; is currently only speculation and should be indicated as suc</p><p>10) A comment rather than a recommendation – In view of the need for a suitable model for the next generation of studies, the manuscript would benefit from effort into re-examination of extra-hypothalamic neurons in the monkey, rather than pursuing electrophysiology in the mouse.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67714.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In discussion between the 3 reviewers and reviewing editor it was agreed that the inclusion of data from the mouse model was more detrimental that beneficial and it is recommended it be removed.

We admit that the mechanisms whereby GnRH regulates ChINs in the adult human putamen might be very different from what we have found in the neonatal mouse model.

To maximize ChAT signal in this study, we have tried tyramide signal amplification. In spite of technical efforts to increase sensitivity, we have found no evidence for any colocalization between GnRH and ChAT in the mouse preoptic area. To maintain the focus of our revised manuscript (which now has no mouse data) on the human, the negative results of this study on mice are only mentioned briefly in the revised discussion (Lines 352-357) instead of being reported as Result.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While I admit that the mouse data are intriguing, direct extrapolation of mouse results to human biology should require more caution.

Indeed, we continue to believe that our original manuscript provides solid evidence that GnRH at the high 1.2 µM dose transiently inhibits ~50% of ChINs in the CPU of neonatal mice via direct actions on GnRHR1 autoreceptors. However, we accept that these data do not provide sufficient support for the inhibitory role of GnRH in the adult human putamen. All comments regarding inhibition, including the illustration of GNAIs in the revised Figure 3C (RNA-seq results) have been removed from the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The antisera used were polyclonal and the possibility of overlapping signal produced by a non-decapeptide epitope remains.

We have shown that this argument is not relevant to the human putamen by showing that GAP and several GnRH antibodies, including #LR-1, do recognize well human extrahypothalamic GnRH neurons. An additional argument used in the previous studies on embryonic/fetal monkeys by the Terasawa group was the immunohistochemical detection of THOP1 in extrahypothalamic GnRH neurons. In the revised manuscript we have discussed more abundantly the ubiquitous nature and multiple substrates of THOP1. We argued that presence of THOP1 in human ChINs does not necessarily indicate that GnRH is cleaved and inactivated by this enzyme. We supported this view by noting that Terasawa and co-workers also identified THOP1 signal in the developing <italic>bona fide</italic> hypothalamic GnRH neurons (late type GnRH neurons) of the monkey which can undoubtedly generate and release the GnRH decapeptide. We agree with the reviewer that our data do not exclude the possibility that GnRH1-5 also has a functional role. This has also been recognized in the revised and extended discussion.

Later, other analyses are applied to other independent samples from other donors. While all the info is detailed in Suppl. Figure 4, which reports a total of 28 individuals in the brain collection, it is suggested the authors make extra-efforts to emphasize how representative the findings are for humans, considering the multiple variables occurring (sex, age, condition, etc.). On the later, were all subjects studied excluded for neurological disease?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a large biological heterogeneity characterizes the human samples which is complicated further by technical variations that are difficult to control (e.g. <italic>perimortem</italic> and <italic>postmortem</italic> conditions). Such conditions may all influence the staining and quantification results and, unfortunately, it is not possible to determine the contribution of individual variables to the staining results obtained in individual samples. In the revised manuscript we have recognized the existence of sample heterogeneity (Lines 308-311; Lines 447-449). We have also stated that samples were obtained from individuals without known neurological disorders (Line 445). For each study, we have now specified in Results the code and number of samples used for each experiment. The revised Supplementary File 1 includes data on the human subjects used in each experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) For the RNAseq, the RIN numbers are somewhat low, and may have contributed to the need for adding an extra cycle for their library creation. The sequencing depth is also adequate but not strong, again likely attributable to the difficulty of this tissue. This should be adequate for a snapshot of presence detection, although one control sample (SPN22) has much lower reads. Notably the expression of GnRH receptor, which is key to their conclusions, is barely above their apparent level of detection at &gt; 5CPM, thus interpretation of these data mandates caution. Inclusion of the sequencing data for the ChIN and SPN marker data would add rigor and also provide the reader with a better idea of the CPM level that can be interpreted. Figure 4 suggests the marker genes are all &gt;60CPM, thelist of &quot;classical receptors&quot; only has 4 (of 77) with average CPM below 5, but the &quot;other receptors&quot; have 67 genes with &lt;5CPM (out of 534) and GNRHR is just &gt;5CPM for the ChIN samples and zero for the SPN. It is also strongly suggested to include the CPM for all the mapped genes in their build (GRCh38.p13).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the technical comments about RNA-sequencing. We agree that, in general, suboptimal methods may cause lack of detection of low-abundance transcripts. In the past few years our laboratory invested much effort into the development of an optimal protocol to carry out RNA-seq studies on cell populations isolated with LCM from formalin-fixed <italic>postmortem</italic> samples. The selection of the “FFPE” RNA isolation kit and the RNA-seq library preparation kit (which latter uses ribosomal RNA depletion and random primers instead of oligo(dT), for reverse transcription) allow reliable library preparation from nanogram amounts of partly degraded starting RNA (Schuierer et al., 2017). We believe that the 13664 and 12637 different transcripts we identified at CPM≥5 in ChINs and the 13,558 and 13,682 transcripts at CPM≥5 in SPNs, indicate a reasonably high detection sensitivity of the method for even low abundance receptor transcripts, including <italic>GNRHR1</italic>. <italic>GNRHR1</italic> occurred in both independent human ChIN samples at similar relative abundances (i.e. cpm 7.8 and 5.0), while being entirely absent from the two SPN pools.</p><p>We have agreed to provide a complete RNA-seq dataset. We have supplemented the revised Supplementary File 3 which now has a sheet with the full list of annotated ChIN and SPN transcripts, irrespective of cpm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Based on cell numbers and morphology, it is concluded that basal ganglia GnRH neurons have a different origin than hypothalamic GnRH neurons. However, both hypothalamic and extra-hypothalamic GnRH neurons appear to be cholinergic. Did the authors consider performing deep sequencing of hypothalamic GnRH neurons to identify similarities and differences between these two neuronal populations? This may help to better define the differential origin and functional features of these two neuronal sets.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion and we agree that such a comparison would be critically important and interesting. A promising method for deep transcriptome profiling of immunohistochemically labeled hypothalamic GnRH neurons is currently under development in our laboratory. A major technical challenge is still to preserve RNA during immunohistochemical procedures. We have recognized this challenge in the revised Discussion (Lines 333-340).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors openly discuss the fact that the existence of extra-hypothalamic GnRH neuronal populations had been previously defined by pioneering work by Rance and coworkers in 1990's. Admittedly, the present study discloses a much larger population of GnRH neurons, and applies modern technologies to phenotype them. Considering that the previous work identified a much smaller set of extra-hypothalamic GnRH neurons, could the authors speculate why they think this rather large set of GnRH neurons was not identified in that previous study? Was it just because the previous study did not evaluate the striatum? Or was this due to technical limitations of the previous studies?</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we have discussed that Rance of coworkers did not analyze the entire extent of the putamen. We believe that, in itself, this may explain why the cell numbers differ so much in the two studies (Lines 311-315). In addition, we have discussed why we think that our immunohistochemical study could even fail to detect neurons with low signal levels; therefore, we suggest that the real number of extrahypothalamic GnRH neurons could be even higher than in our report (Lines 308-311).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) While the present results open numerous questions, the functional implications of the data, in terms of human physiology and pathophysiology, are rather open and the extensive discussion of this issue makes the paper a bit over-speculative. In the same vein, the possibility that GnRH might be considered a useful therapy to neurodegenerative disorders is not sufficiently based on actual data, even considering the mouse results. Application of GnRH analogs is not devoid of potential side-effects and even may suffer desensitization, which makes this possibility quite speculative. I would suggest this sections is markedly shorten if not eliminated.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have omitted the speculation about the clinical use of GnRH analogs from the abstract and the discussion. We note that although the reproductive side effects of GnRH analogues would limit the use of this strategy in clinical practice (Almeida, 2004), the transcriptome profile of ChINs (Figure 5 and Supplementary File 3) offers a few alternative receptorial mechanisms to counteract the hyperactivity of ChINs in PD (Lines 424-427).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The Discussion is fragmented into multiple sub-sections. While in some cases this is useful to follow the line of reasoning and major conclusions, in other instances, the sub-sections are rather short and mainly recapitulate the Results section. I would suggest that the authors try to integrate the multiple subsections into 2-3 major pieces, so the Discussion appears more fluent and cohesive.</p></disp-quote><p>As recommended, we combined several subsections where we could in the revised Discussion to achieve an improved flow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Line 72-73 that &quot;GnRH acts on GnRHR1 autoreceptors to regulate higher order non-reproductive functions &quot; is currently only speculation and should be indicated as suc</p></disp-quote><p>By removing the whole mouse block, we have given up the only functional evidence for the direct action of GnRH on GnRHR1 autoreceptors in ChINs. The idea that GnRH acts on GnRHR1 autoreceptors now only relies on the RNA-seq detection of both <italic>GNRH1</italic> and <italic>GNRHR1</italic> in human ChINs but not in SPNs. Although we are confident that the RNA-seq data are strong, we use conservative writing when suggesting that GnRH likely acts on autoreceptors in the human ChINs. In addition, we also recognize the possibility that other rare cell types of the human putamen not studied here may also express GnRHR1 (Lines 389-391).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) A comment rather than a recommendation – In view of the need for a suitable model for the next generation of studies, the manuscript would benefit from effort into re-examination of extra-hypothalamic neurons in the monkey, rather than pursuing electrophysiology in the mouse.</p></disp-quote><p>We also appreciated this comment and we agree that monkeys would provide a much better model animal than neonatal mice. Using HPLC-MS/MS, it would be interesting and relatively easy to revisit the issue of whether extrahypothalamic brain regions of the monkey have GnRH, GnRH1-5, or both.</p></body></sub-article></article>
