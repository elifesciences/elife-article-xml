However, it remains unclear how is lifestyle associated with overall and organ-specific aging and which factors contribute most in Southwest China.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>This study involved 8396 participants who completed two surveys from the China Multi-Ethnic Cohort (CMEC) study. The healthy lifestyle index (HLI) was developed using five lifestyle factors: smoking, alcohol, diet, exercise, and sleep. The comprehensive and organ-specific biological ages (BAs) were calculated using the Klemera–Doubal method based on longitudinal clinical laboratory measurements, and validation were conducted to select BA reflecting related diseases. Fixed effects model was used to examine the associations between HLI or its components and the acceleration of validated BAs. We further evaluated the relative contribution of lifestyle components to comprehension and organ systems BAs using quantile G-computation.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>About two-thirds of participants changed HLI scores between surveys. After validation, three organ-specific BAs (the cardiopulmonary, metabolic, and liver BAs) were identified as reflective of specific diseases and included in further analyses with the comprehensive BA. The health alterations in HLI showed a protective association with the acceleration of all BAs, with a mean shift of –0.19 (95% CI −0.34, –0.03) in the comprehensive BA acceleration. Diet and smoking were the major contributors to overall negative associations of five lifestyle factors, with the comprehensive BA and metabolic BA accounting for 24% and 55% respectively.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Healthy lifestyle changes were inversely related to comprehensive and organ-specific biological aging in Southwest China, with diet and smoking contributing most to comprehensive and metabolic BA separately. Our findings highlight the potential of lifestyle interventions to decelerate aging and identify intervention targets to limit organ-specific aging in less-developed regions.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>This work was primarily supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 82273740) and Sichuan Science and Technology Program (Natural Science Foundation of Sichuan Province, Grant No. 2024NSFSC0552).

There are also important differences between chronological aging, which measures how many years a person has lived, and biological aging, which involves the biological processes that cause age-related changes in the body. Some people may have slower biological aging than others despite being the same chronological age. Genetics, the environment, and lifestyle differences likely explain why some people have slower biological aging than others.</p><p>Large studies assessing both lifestyle changes and biological aging may provide new insights into aging. One such study is the China Multi-Ethnic Cohort Study, which followed about 100,000 people in Southwest China between 2018 and 2021. The study included a diverse sample of people from different ethnic backgrounds and collected lifestyle information and data on various organ systems.</p><p>Zhang, Tang et al. show that diet improvements and quitting smoking can slow biological and organ-specific aging. The analysis looked at data from about 8,400 participants in the China Multi-Ethnic Cohort Study who completed two surveys about their lifestyles over the course of the study. Laboratory measurements from the participants assessed biological aging in various organ systems over the same period. Adopting a healthy diet like the Mediterranean diet had the greatest effect on overall biological aging, contributing 24% to the overall protective effect of healthier lifestyle modifications. Quitting smoking had the greatest impact on metabolic health, responsible for 55% of the slowdown in metabolic aging seen with healthier lifestyle changes. The changes were particularly pronounced in more disadvantaged groups who may disproportionately face environmental stress or have more limited access to resources.</p><p>The analysis shows that healthy lifestyle changes can slow biological aging, particularly in regions with fewer health resources. The results suggest that targeted lifestyle interventions may help delay age-related conditions like heart or liver disease in such areas. It also suggests that promoting healthy diets and quitting smoking are the most impactful lifestyle changes. More studies are needed to confirm the results and test interventions that overcome barriers to healthy lifestyles in under-resourced areas.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>biological aging</kwd><kwd>healthy lifestyle</kwd><kwd>organ-specific aging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82273740</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Xiong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100018542</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Sichuan Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2024NSFSC0552</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Xiong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Healthy lifestyle changes, particularly improvements in diet and smoking, were inversely related to comprehensive and organ-specific biological aging in Southwest China, highlighting key intervention targets to limit aging.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aging is a global issue, with about 10% of the world population aged 65 years and over in 2022, and the proportion expected to be near 16% by 2050 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Department of Economic and Social Affairs and ECONOMIC UNDF, 2023</xref>). In China, the proportion has reached 14.2% at the end of 2021 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pot et al., 2022</xref>). Aging leads to reduced life expectancy and chronic diseases through dynamic and heterogeneous changes in biological systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kennedy et al., 2014</xref>). While chronological age (CA) is widely used as a marker of aging, biological age (BA) has been constructed as a more accurate indicator for biological aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hamczyk et al., 2020</xref>). Aging exhibits variations across and within individuals; people with the same CA can age at different rates, and distinct organ systems within an individual can also age differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schaum et al., 2020</xref>). Comprehensive aging indicators like epigenetic clocks and PhenoAge, capturing different aging aspects, have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jylhävä et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Recent studies have focused on organ-specific aging markers to understand their aging rate variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nie et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tian et al., 2023</xref>). The process of biological aging, influenced by genetics, environment, and health behaviors, is modifiable, yet research has predominantly concentrated on comprehensive BA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bauer and Newman, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belsky et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Elliott et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fiorito et al., 2021</xref>). Nevertheless, current research on determinants of multi-organ biological aging remains limited. Further investigation is crucial to deepen understanding of comprehensive and organ-specific biological aging and to develop targeted interventions for age-related diseases of each organ system.</p><p>Lifestyle factors such as smoking, drinking, diet, physical activity, and sleep are recognized as contributors to many age-related diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Han et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Henry et al., 2019</xref>), and researchers have begun to explore how lifestyle factors influence the process of biological aging. Studies on lifestyle and BA can be summarized into two categories, one focusing on the association of a single lifestyle factor with biological aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klopack et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kresovich et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kresovich et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gao et al., 2022</xref>) because lifestyle factors may be interrelated and have cumulative effects, the other further focusing on the impact of a combined lifestyle on biological aging. Research focusing on healthy lifestyles has been conducted in Chinese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liang et al., 2023</xref>), American (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Thomas et al., 2023</xref>), and British populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yang et al., 2022</xref>) and has found that adherence to a healthy lifestyle is consistently associated with slower biological aging. However, most studies used one-time measurements of lifestyle factors as exposure and could not examine the impact of lifestyle changes on BA. In addition, research has often focused on epigenetic age and PhenoAge. The Klemera–Doubal method of biological age (KDM-BA) has been shown to perform well in predicting frailty and mortality and is used to identify the BAs of organ systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nie et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhong et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, KDM-BA, based on clinical lab data sets, offers accessible and cost-effective means for aging identification and intervention. Besides, no study has been conducted to analyze further the relative contributions of multiple lifestyle changes on various organ systems BA, which could identify important influences on the comprehensive and organ-specific biological aging to prioritize interventions, especially in developing regions with limited resources. Southwest China is characterized by multi-ethnicity, unbalanced internal development, and rapid aging, making identifying priority intervenable aging factors important.</p><p>Therefore, based on the China Multi-Ethnic Cohort (CMEC) study, this study aimed to develop potential BAs for organ systems using the KDM algorithm, explore how lifestyle changes correlate with both comprehensive and organ-specific BAs, and further investigate the relative contributions of individual lifestyle components in southwest China.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study population</title><p>This study used data from the CMEC baseline and repeated surveys for analysis. The CMEC adopted a multi-stage stratified cluster sampling, with participants covering five provinces and seven ethnic groups (Tibetan, Yi, Miao, Bai, Bouyei, Dong, and Han) in Southwest China, representing the local regional and ethnic characteristics. The baseline survey of the CMEC was conducted between May 2018 and September 2019, and the repeated survey was conducted between August 2020 and June 2021. The CMEC baseline survey included 99,556 individuals, with 10% of the sample population selected for the repeated survey. Details of the CMEC procedures and methodology have been described in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>). Participants' personal interviews, physical examinations, and clinical laboratory measurements were completed using a uniform standardized operating procedure in both surveys. The study protocol was approved by the Sichuan University Medical Ethical Review Board (ID: K2016038, K2020022). All participants in the study signed an informed consent form before the investigation.</p><p>In this study, we included participants with available information on lifestyle, measurements for calculating BA required, and covariates. We excluded individuals with missing data to calculate BA and individuals with incomplete data on lifestyle and covariates for participants at the baseline and repeated survey. Finally, 8396 individuals aged 30–79 were included as the full set in the longitudinal analysis after matching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Flowchart of the study.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-99924-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Definition of lifestyle factors</title><p>Considering previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guasch-Ferré et al., 2022</xref>), the healthy lifestyle index (HLI) was established through five lifestyle factors: smoking, alcohol consumption, diet, exercise, and sleep. Data for the lifestyle factors were obtained from the questionnaire, and the simplified semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was assessed by trained staff. The FFQ’s reproducibility and validity were evaluated by conducting repeated FFQs and 24-hour dietary recalls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xiao et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The definitions of a healthy lifestyle are as follows. Smoking was categorized according to smoking status, and never smoking was defined as healthy. For alcohol consumption, according to the findings of recent research on alcohol consumption in Chinese populations, being healthy was defined as being a non-regular drinker (drinking frequency less than once a week) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Millwood et al., 2023</xref>). For diet, since the Mediterranean diet (MED) is currently the most internationally recognized healthy dietary pattern and has widely and robustly beneficial effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mazza et al., 2021</xref>), we used the alternative Mediterranean diet (aMED) to evaluate dietary quality, with details shown in the supplemental material. Since the HLI already contained a drinking component, we removed the drinking item in the aMED, which had a score range of 7–35. We defined individuals with aMED scores ≥population median as healthy diets. More details on the calculation of aMED can be found in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xiao et al., 2021</xref>). For exercise, based on how often participants participated in physical activity in their leisure time during the past year, regular exercise (‘1–2 times/week’, ‘3–5 times/week’, or ‘daily or almost every day’) was categorized as healthy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2022</xref>). For sleep, a sleep duration of 7–8 hours was defined as healthy sleep based on previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chaput et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In addition, to comprehensively evaluate the impact of overall healthy lifestyle level on outcomes, we further constructed the HLI in this study. For each lifestyle, we assign 1 point to health and 0 points to the opposite. The HLI was calculated by directly adding up the five lifestyle scores, ranging from 0 to 5, with a higher score representing an overall healthier lifestyle, denoted as HLI (range) in the following text. We then transformed HLI into a dichotomous variable in this study, denoted as HLI (category), where a score of 4–5 for HLI was considered a healthy lifestyle, and a score of 0–3 was considered an unfavorable lifestyle that could be improved.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Covariate assessment</title><p>The selection of covariates is based on prior literature review and previously constructed directed acyclic graphs. Covariates included age, sex, ethnicity (majority, minority), urbanicity (rural, urban), education (no schooling, primary school, middle/high school, college/university), occupation (primary industry practitioner, secondary industry practitioner, tertiary industry practitioner, unemployed), marital status (married/cohabiting, not married/cohabitating), total energy intake (kcal/day), depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, menopausal status in women (premenopausal, perimenopausal, postmenopausal), beverage intake (never, former consumer, currently consuming), dietary supplement intake, self-reported doctor-diagnosed diseases of diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer. Among these, sex, ethnicity, urbanicity, and education were considered time-invariant variables, while other variables were considered time-varying.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>BA construction</title><p>The comprehensive BA and BAs across multiple-organ systems were estimated using the Klemera–Doubal method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klemera and Doubal, 2006</xref>), which is well-validated in the Chinese population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2023</xref>). We selected indicators for constructing BA from clinical lab data sets measured in the baseline and repeated surveys of the CMEC, filtering based on a missing rate of less than 30%. Based on previous studies, these indicators were categorized into five systems based on the organ/system function they represent: cardiopulmonary, metabolic, liver, renal, and immune systems, as detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nie et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tian et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, we developed a comprehensive BA alongside five organ system-specific BAs: cardiopulmonary BA, metabolic BA, liver BA, renal BA, and immune BA. The selection process was then completed following the methodology used in our previous studies, which are detailed in the supplementary materials.</p><p>After finishing the screening process, 15 measures were used in constructing the comprehensive BA, which were systolic blood pressure (SBP), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), peak expiratory flow (PEF), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), albumin (ALB), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-CH), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-CH), triglyceride (TG), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatinine (Cr), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), urea, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), glycosylated hemoglobin (HBA1C), and platelet count (PLT). The cardiopulmonary BA was assessed using SBP and PEF; the metabolic BA was assessed using LDL-CH, HDL-CH, HBA1C, TG, and WHR; the liver BA was assessed using AST, GGT, ALP, and ALB; the renal BA was assessed using Cr and urea; and the immune BA was assessed using PLT and MCV. Using the above measures, we calculated each BA in the male and female populations separately using the KDM algorithm. To quantify variation in biological aging between participants, we calculated BA acceleration, which is the difference between each BA and CA simultaneously.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>BA validation</title><p>To assess the performance of the newly developed BAs of multiple-organ systems, we performed a validation analysis to evaluate the relationships between them and organ-specific diseases. Given the short follow-up period in the CMEC study, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis using baseline data. We separately examined the associations between the comprehension BA and CVD, diabetes, cancer, cardiopulmonary BA and CVD and chronic bronchitis, the metabolic BA and CVD and diabetes, the liver BA and chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis, the immune BA and rheumatoid arthritis. For interpretability, we simultaneously standardized and classified each BA acceleration into categories (|BA acceleration|≤1, BA acceleration &lt; –1, and BA acceleration &gt;1). We used logistic regression to assess the associations between each continuous and categorized BA (|BA acceleration|≤1 serving as the reference group) and the diseases. Since the values of BA acceleration of the cardiopulmonary BA were small, it was not processed as categorical variables. The model was additionally adjusted for five healthy lifestyle factors based on the covariates. The comprehensive BA constructed in the CMEC study has been validated to better reflect age-related disease and frailty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xiang et al., 2024</xref>). After completing the validation analysis, we selected BAs reflecting aging and related diseases for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We described changes in lifestyle between the two waves of surveys, where changes were categorized as becoming healthier, remaining unchanged, and becoming unhealthier. For single lifestyles, remaining unchanged indicates that the factor has remained healthy or unhealthy at two surveys; becoming healthier suggests that it was unhealthy at baseline and became healthy on the repeated survey, and vice versa. For the HLI scores, no change indicates the same score in both surveys, a change to healthier implies a repeated survey score higher than the baseline score, and a shift in less healthy indicates a repeated survey score lower than the baseline score. The dichotomous HLI’s change categorization was similar to the single lifestyle. The baseline characteristics of participants were described across categories in the dichotomized HLI, with continuous variables represented by median (interquartile range) and categorical variables by proportions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Characteristics of participants in baseline and

FEM is extensively applied in the analysis of panel data in the fields of sociology, economics, and public health research, where it serves to control for unobserved individual heterogeneity. The detailed methodology of the FEM is outlined in the supplementary materials. Because of the approximately 2-year interval between the two CMEC waves, we assumed that the short-term effect of lifestyle changes on biological aging was linear during this period. Multivariable-adjusted models were constructed to account for potential confounding, including time-varying and time-invariant variables and baseline CA. We incorporated five lifestyle factors as exposures simultaneously into the model, while the continuous and binary HLI were entered into the model as exposures separately. Since the BAs we analyzed may potentially measure overlapping aspects of human aging, we did not correct for multiple comparisons.</p><p>To further obtain the relative contribution of each lifestyle factor on validated comprehension and organ systems BA, the present study used data from two waves for quantile G-computation (QGC) analysis. QGC is a statistical technique for evaluating the effects of mixture exposures, capable of discerning positive and negative influences, and is widely used in environmental epidemiology research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Keil et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>). Additionally, subgroup analyses for continuous and categorized HLI and each validated BA were conducted across sex (male vs. female), baseline age (&lt;60 vs. ≥60), ethnicity (majority vs. minority), urbanicity (rural vs. urban), baseline BA acceleration (&lt;0 vs. ≥0), and baseline disease status (free of diabetes, CVD, and cancer vs. either one). The heterogeneity between strata was assessed using the Q test (<italic>α</italic> = 0.1 was considered significant heterogeneity).</p><p>We performed sensitivity analyses concerning exposure definitions, confounders, and our analysis method. First, we repeated the analysis of the association between lifestyles and BAs using a standard FEM, with adjustments made only for time-varying variables. Second, we used alternative common health criteria for each lifestyle factor separately, and we repeated the FEM analyses and QGC analyses by replacing the health definition of one lifestyle factor at a time. Exposure definitions for the main analyses and sensitivity analyses are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>. Third, we did not adjust for body mass index (BMI) in models because some studies have suggested that BMI may be an intermediate factor between lifestyles and health outcomes. However, in the sensitivity analysis, we additionally adjusted for BMI in the FEM and QGC analyses models. Statistical analyses were performed using R Project for Statistical Computing version 4.1.1 (Vienna, Austria).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Lifestyle changes between two waves in CMEC</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows the changes in lifestyle factors in the study population from baseline to repeated surveys.

Shift in smoking was related to a change in metabolic BA acceleration of –0.54 (95% CI −0.97, –0.11), and the results of individual lifestyle factors and the cardiopulmonary BA as well as the liver BA did not reach statistical significance.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Associations of healthy lifestyle factors and HLI with the BA acceleration of validated BAs.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Variables</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">ComprehensiveBA accelerationβ (95% CI)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">CardiopulmonaryBA accelerationβ (95% CI)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">MetabolicBA accelerationβ (95% CI)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">LiverBA accelerationβ (95% CI)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">HLI (range)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Per 1-point increase</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.11 (–0.19, –0.03)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.02 (–0.04, –0.01)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.12 (–0.22, –0.02)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.23 (–0.47, 0.00)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">HLI (category)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">To have a healthy lifestyle</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.19 (–0.34, –0.03)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.03 (–0.07, 0.00)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.16 (–0.36, 0.03)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.19 (–0.66, 0.27)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Healthy lifestyle factors</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"> ΔSmoking</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.13 (–0.47, 0.21)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.03 (–0.10, 0.04)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.54 (–0.97, –0.11)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.57 (–1.58, 0.44)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"> ΔAlcohol</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.17 (-0.47, 0.13)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.02 (–0.09, 0.04)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.18 (–0.56, 0.21)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.59 (–1.50, 0.31)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"> ΔDiet</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.15 (–0.29, –0.00)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.01 (–0.04, 0.02)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.18 (–0.36, 0.00)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.10 (–0.53, 0.33)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"> ΔExercise</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.16 (–0.32, 0.00)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.03 (–0.07, 0.00)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.09 (–0.30, 0.11)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.05 (–0.53, 0.44)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"> ΔSleep</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.02 (–0.16, 0.12)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.02 (–0.05, 0.01)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.01 (–0.17, 0.19)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–0.36 (–0.78, 0.06)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Estimates were obtained using FEMs treating the BA accelerations as the dependent variables and HLI (as either continuous or as categorized) or five individual lifestyle factors as the independent variables.

About two-thirds of the participants were observed to change their HLI scores between the two surveys. The health alterations in HLI showed a protective association between accelerated aging of comprehension and each organ system. The relative contribution of diet was the largest among all lifestyle components for the comprehensive BA, and smoking contributed the most to the metabolic BA, respectively, suggesting that these factors are particularly crucial in specifically decelerating the pace of biological aging.</p><p>In our study, the prevalence of healthy lifestyles was higher than the prevalence reported by research based on the China Kadoorie Biobank study and the China Nutrition and Health Surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sun et al., 2022</xref>), with those with 4–5 lifestyle factors accounting for 41.2 and 39.0% at baseline and repeated surveys, respectively. The relatively high prevalence of healthy lifestyles in this study may be explained by the recent establishment of the CMEC and an overall trend toward healthier lifestyles, alongside different lifestyle standards. Furthermore, we noted lifestyle changes in our research and subsequently employed the FEM for analysis based on this observation. Lifestyle may be influenced by environmental factors such as urbanization and individual characteristics such as health awareness, and thus, lifestyle may change over time, yet fewer studies have focused on this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lao et al., 2014</xref>). The high proportion of changes occurring in sleep, exercise, and diet here suggests that they may be more variable and relatively easy to intervene. For overall health styles, there was a higher proportion of changes in lifestyle scores but fewer shifts from unhealthy to healthy or healthy to unhealthy. That is, while lifestyle fluctuates over time, it is less likely to change substantially, consistent with the findings of another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Han et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Our study reveals that healthy lifestyle shifts can slow the pace of comprehensive BA, with diet being a crucial component. Both the HLI range and category showed robust protective associations. Although there are differences in lifestyle definitions and aging indicators, available studies consistently find that healthier lifestyles are associated with lower aging accelerationv (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Thomas et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Simons et al., 2022</xref>). Despite limited research on how lifestyle components contribute to aging, our study provides additional evidence. We used the widely recommended aMED as a healthy dietary criterion, which includes rich plant foods, olive oil, moderate fish, and red wine, some of which may slow aging and promote health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). In our study, the association between exercise and comprehensive BA was nearly statistically significant. Higher levels of exercise have been shown to be associated with a lower incidence of chronic disease and a longer lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Watts et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kankaanpää et al., 2021</xref>). Diet and exercise may slow aging through beneficial DNA methylation changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Galkin et al., 2023</xref>), modification of gut microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>), and reducing oxidative stress and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aleksandrova et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">El Assar et al., 2022</xref>), collectively enhancing fitness and slowing the aging pace. Combining the previous randomized controlled trial with our findings, the evidence suggested that diet and exercise are easily modifiable anti-aging factors in the real world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fiorito et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Another contribution of our study is presenting evidence of different lifestyle factors influencing multi-organ BA, which was constructed and validated for Southwest China. The HLI still played a protective role against aging across various organ systems, yet the components contributing most varied specifically. Biological aging varies across organ systems, and the associations with lifestyle may differ. Change in smoking played a significant role in metabolic aging. The current study of the British population has also identified smoking as a factor influencing aging across multiple-organ systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tian et al., 2023</xref>). The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study revealed that smoking contributed to epigenetic aging acceleration by 83.5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2022</xref>). The variation in results could be attributed to the fact that current studies offer evidence of cumulative exposure to smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klopack et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2022</xref>), while our research focuses on short-term changes. Short-term smoking behavior changes may be sufficient to impact metabolism aging but do not significantly affect the comprehensive BA. Existing research has shown that the metabolic and immune systems can impact various systems through inter-organ aging pathways, making it essential to focus on modifiable factors of metabolic system aging. Hence, we discovered that smoking could serve as an intervention target for organ system aging, holding the potential to delay the onset of diseases in specific systems, thereby extending a healthy lifespan.</p><p>In subgroup analysis, we discovered that negative associations of HLI and the comprehensive BA acceleration varied among ethnic groups. No observed differences in HLI category change between ethnic groups, potentially due to insufficient statistical power. Compared to the majority group, the minority may have lower socioeconomic status and less health awareness, leading to less management of lifestyle factors, and, consequently, stronger associations when changes in these factors occur. Given that biological aging is a cause of various long-term outcomes, these results highlight the importance of conducting interventions among minority groups in Southwest China.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Unlike previous studies that used one measurement of lifestyle or BA, our study utilized longitudinal data from two waves of the CMEC study, which measured the longitudinal changes in lifestyle behaviors and BA of the body and multi-organ systems. We also assessed the impact of alterations in healthy lifestyle factors on validated BAs and further characterized the relative contributions. This comprehensive approach offers the latest evidence for the early prevention and targeted behavioral interventions of organ-specific aging and related diseases in southwestern China.</p><p>This study has certain limitations. Firstly, our construction of multi-organ BA was limited by the clinical lab data measures, preventing the development of BAs for some organ systems like the brain. Additionally, we could not fully capture specific aging processes of the immune system because of few immune-related indicators and the possible omission of critical markers. However, we used routinely detected biomarkers to construct the BA, which are cost-effective and easily implemented. Therefore, this multi-organ BAs are suitable for broad adoption in primary prevention, especially in developing areas like Southwestern China. Besides, the CMEC had a limited range of diseases collected, precluding all BAs validation. Thus, we finally included only those BAs that could be validated for further analysis. Secondly, as an observational study, we established a prospective association between healthy lifestyles and accelerated aging, yet it does not confirm a causal relationship. Thirdly, the CMEC was established in 2018 with only data from two survey waves, which highlights the drawback of reduced statistical power of FEM. Future research could build on long-term, multi-wave follow-ups, employing FEM analysis based on repeatedly collected data to derive more reliable causal effect estimates. Fourthly, there is no gold standard for measuring biological aging. However, the KDM-BA method used in this study has the advantage of accurately predicting aging-related outcomes, and it has been validated in our study population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xiang et al., 2024</xref>). Fifth, assessment of lifestyle factors was based on self-reported data collected through questionnaires, which may be subject to recall bias. Lastly, our study is based on a population from the Southwestern China, which could limit the generalizability of our findings. However, the Southwestern China is characterized by its diverse ethnicities and lower developmental level, with few studies addressing biological aging there. This research may provide crucial information for interventions in other less-developed regions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Within the Southwest China population, we observed that healthy lifestyle changes were inversely related to comprehensive and organ-specific accelerated biological aging, with diet and smoking making the most significant contributions to the comprehensive BA and metabolic BA separately. These findings underscore the potential for lifestyle interventions to slow the aging pace and identify priority intervention targets to various organ-specific aging in less-developed regions.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>A patent related to the CMEC study exists ('Risk Prediction Method for Metabolic Syndrome Based on SMOTE Technology and Random Forest Algorithm', Patent No. ZL 2021 1 0628911.9), on which two of our authors (Xiong Xiao and Xing Zhao) are co-inventors.

In addition, The authors acknowledge the limitations of this approach, namely that some biomarkers may not fully capture the complete aging process of the system; this weakness is particularly remarkable in organ-specific BA. The authors emphasize that it is cost-effective and easy to implement. However, the results associated with organ-specific BA may not be credible because they do not fully reflect the state of a particular organ. It is recommended that these shortcomings and the applicability of the results should be discussed in the text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.99924.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Yuan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sichuan University West China School of Public Health</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tang</surname><given-names>Dan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sichuan University West China School of Public Health</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Ning</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sichuan University West China School of Public Health</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Xiang</surname><given-names>Yi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>West China school of Public Health and West China Fourth Hospital, Sichuan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Yifan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sichuan University West China School of Public Health</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Qian</surname><given-names>Wen</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Chengdu Center for Disease Control and Prevention</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Baima</surname><given-names>Yangji</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>School of Medicine,Tibet University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lhasa</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ding</surname><given-names>Xianbin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Chongqing Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chongqing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Ziyun</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>School of Public Health, the Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Monitoring and Disease Control, Ministry of Education, Guizhou Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Guiyang</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yin</surname><given-names>Jianzhong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Kunming Medical University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Kunming</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Xiong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>West China school of Public Health and West China Fourth Hospital, Sichuan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Xing</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sichuan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife Assessment</bold></p><p>This useful study examined the associations of a healthy lifestyle with comprehensive and organ-specific biological ages defined using common blood biomarkers and body measures.

We understand the concern regarding the potential selection bias due to only 8.5% of participants being included in the study. The baseline survey of China Multi-Ethnic Cohort Study (CMEC) employed a rigorous multi-stage stratified cluster sampling method and the repeat survey reevaluated approximately 10% of baseline participants through community-based cluster random sampling. Therefore, the sample of the repeat survey is representative. The second reason for the loss of sample size was the availability of biomarkers for BA calculation. We have compared characteristic of the overall population, the population included in and excluded from this study. Most characteristics were similar, but participants included in this study showed better in some health-related variables, one potential reason is healthier individuals were more likely to complete the follow-up survey. In conclusion, we believe that the impact of selection bias is limited.</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><title>Baseline characteristics

We appreciate the opportunity to clarify these aspects of our study. For the first question, we evaluated the FFQ's reproducibility and validity by conducting repeated FFQs and 24-hour dietary recalls at the baseline survey. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for reproducibility ranged from 0.15 for fresh vegetables to 0.67 for alcohol, while deattenuated Spearman rank correlations for validity ranged from 0.10 for soybean products to 0.66 for rice. More details are provided in our previous study (Lancet Reg Health West Pac, 2021).

To avoid taking up too much space in the main text, we decided not to include the detailed aMED calculation (as described in Circulation, 2009) there and instead placed it in the supplementary materials:</p><p>“Our calculated aMED score incorporates eight components: vegetables, legumes, fruits, whole grains, fish, the ratio of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) to saturated fatty acids (SFA), red and processed meats, and alcohol. Each component's consumption was divided into sex-specific quintiles. Scores ranging from 1 to 5 were assigned based on quintile rankings to each component, except for red and processed meats and alcohol, for which the scoring was inverted. The alcohol criteria for the aMED was defined as moderate consumption. Since the healthy lifestyle index (HLI) already contained a drinking component, we removed the drinking item in the aMED, which had a score range of 7-35 with a higher score reflecting better adherence to the overall Mediterranean dietary pattern. We defined individuals with aMED scores ≥ population median as healthy diets.”</p><p>Reference:</p><p>(1) Xiao X, Qin Z, Lv X, Dai Y, Ciren Z, Yangla Y, et al.

For example, can cardiopulmonary BA be reflected only by using cardiopulmonary status? I do not think so.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the opportunity to clarify. We constructed the comprehensive BA based on all the available biochemical data from the CMEC study, selecting aging-related markers (J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci, 2021), and further construct organ-specific BAs based on these selected biomarkers. The KDM algorithm does not specify biomarker types but requires them to be correlated with chronological age (CA) (Ageing Dev, 2006). Existing studies typically construct BA based on available biomarker, we included 15 biomarkers in this study, which could be considered comprehensive and extensive compared to previous research (J Transl Med. 2023; J Am Heart Assoc. 2024; Nat Cardiovasc Res. 2024). For how the biomarkers for each organ-specific BAs were selected, we categorized biomarkers primarily based on their relevance to the structure and function of each organ system according to the classification in previous studies (Nat Med, 2023; Cell Rep, 2022). Since the biomarkers we used came from clinical-lab data sets, they were categorized based on the clinical interpretation of blood chemistry tests following the methods outlined in the two referenced papers (Nat Med, 2023; Cell Rep, 2022). We only used biomarkers directly related to each specific system to minimize overlap between the indicators used for different BAs, thereby preserving the distinctiveness of organ-specific BAs. We acknowledge the limitations of this approach that a few biomarkers may not fully capture the complete aging process of a system, and certain indicators may be missing due to data constraints. However, the multi-organ BAs we constructed are cost-effective, easy to implement, and have been validated, making them valuable despite the limitations.</p><p>Reference:</p><p>(1) Verschoor CP, Belsky DW, Ma J, Cohen AA, Griffith LE, Raina P.

The equal-weight approach to construct the HLI is commonly used in current research (Bmj, 2021; Diabetes Care. 2022; Arch Gerontol Geriatr. 2022). The equal-weight HLI can demonstrate the average benefit of adopting each additional healthy lifestyle and avoid assumptions about the relative importance of different behaviors, which may vary depending on the population.

We only used biomarkers directly related to each specific system to minimize overlap between the indicators used for different BAs, thereby preserving the distinctiveness of organ-specific BAs.</p><p>We have added a descriptive table for the comprehensive and organ systems BAs in the supplementary materials to provide a more detailed understanding of the distribution and characteristics of BAs:</p><table-wrap id="sa2table2" position="float"><label>Author response table 2.</label><caption><title>Description of BA and BA acceleration.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">BA</th><th align="left" valign="top">Comprehensive BA</th><th align="left" valign="top">Cardiopulmonary BA</th><th align="left" valign="top">Metabolic BA</th><th align="left" valign="top">Liver BA</th><th align="left" valign="top">Renal BA</th><th align="left" valign="top">Immune BA</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><bold>KDM-BA</bold></td><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Baseline</td><td align="left" valign="top">51.66 (12.45)</td><td align="left" valign="top">51.66 (11.50)</td><td align="left" valign="top">51.66 (13.31)</td><td align="left" valign="top">51.66 (17.35)</td><td align="left" valign="top">51.66 (15.24)</td><td align="left" valign="top">51.66 (14.00)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Follow-up</td><td align="left" valign="top">53.85 (12.04)</td><td align="left" valign="top">53.43 (10.84)</td><td align="left" valign="top">53.94 (13.01)</td><td align="left" valign="top">56.58 (17.59)</td><td align="left" valign="top">53.59 (14.67)</td><td align="left" valign="top">54.24 (13.51)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Change</td><td align="left" valign="top">2.49 (4.09)</td><td align="left" valign="top">2.00 (0.94)</td><td align="left" valign="top">2.32 (5.26)</td><td align="left" valign="top">5.09 (12.57)</td><td align="left" valign="top">2.31 (9.11)</td><td align="left" valign="top">2.68 (5.07)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><bold>KDM-BA acceleration</bold></td><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Baseline</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.00 (4.83)</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.00 (0.91)</td><td align="left" valign="top">–0.00 (6.76)</td><td align="left" valign="top">–0.00 (13.02)</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.00 (10.03)</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.00 (8.04)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Follow-up</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.39 (4.89)</td><td align="left" valign="top">–0.04 (0.94)</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.48 (6.78)</td><td align="left" valign="top">3.11 (13.98)</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.13 (9.85)</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.77 (7.95)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Change</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.44 (4.09)</td><td align="left" valign="top">–0.05 (0.86)</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.27 (5.25)</td><td align="left" valign="top">3.05 (12.55)</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.26 (9.14)</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.63 (5.06)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>BA, biological age</p></fn><fn><p>Data are presented as mean (standard deviation).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors categorized the HLI score into a dichotomous variable, which may cause a loss of information.

We categorized each lifestyle factor into a binary variable based on relevant guidelines and studies, which recommend assigning a score of 1 if the guideline or study recommendations are met (Bmj, 2021; J Am Heart Assoc, 2023). While dichotomization may lead to some loss of information, it allows for a clearer interpretation and comparison of adherence to ideal healthy lifestyle behaviors. Another advantage of this treatment is that it allows for easy comparison with other studies. We categorized the HLI score into a dichotomous variable to enhance the practical relevance of the results (J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci, 2021). Additionally, we conducted analyses using the continuous HLI score to ensure that our findings were robust, and the results were consistent with those obtained using the dichotomous HLI.</p><p>Reference:</p><p>(1) Verschoor CP, Belsky DW, Ma J, Cohen AA, Griffith LE, Raina P.

The QGC obtains causal relationships and estimates weights for each component, which has been widely used in epidemiological research. More details about QGC can be found in the supplementary methods. The reason some results are not displayed is that we assumed all healthy lifestyle changes would have a protective effect on BA acceleration. However, the effect size of some lifestyle factors did not align with this assumption and lacked statistical significance. Because positive and negative weights were calculated separately in QGC, with all positive weights summing to 1 and all negative weights summing to 1, these factors would have had large positive weights. To avoid potential misunderstandings, we chose not to include these results in the figures.
