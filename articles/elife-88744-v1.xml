Insects seasonal polyphenism is a successful strategy adopted by some species to adapt the changeable external environment. <italic>Cacopsylla chinensis</italic> (Yang &amp; Li) showed two seasonal morphotypes, summer-form and winter-form, with significant differences in morphological characteristics. Low temperature is the key environmental factor to induce its transition from summer-form to winter-form. However, the detailed molecular mechanism remains unknown. Here, we firstly confirmed that low temperature of 10 °C induced the transition from summer-form to winter-form by affecting the cuticle thickness and chitin content. Subsequently, we demonstrated that <italic>CcTRPM</italic> functions as a temperature receptor to regulate this transition. In addition, miR-252 was identified to mediate the expression of <italic>CcTRPM</italic> to involve in this morphological transition. Finally, we found <italic>CcTre1</italic> and <italic>CcCHS1</italic>, two rate-limiting enzymes of insect chitin biosyntheis, act as the critical down-stream signal of <italic>CcTRPM</italic> in mediating this behavioral transition. Taken together, our results revealed that a signal transduction cascade mediates the seasonal polyphenism in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>.

Insects, as the largest animal population on the earth, adapt to the complex and changeable external environment by displaying polyphenism, thus achieving the purpose of survival and reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Simpson et al., 2011</xref>). Insect polyphenism is the phenomenon allows them within a given genotype to produce two or more distinct phenotypes under the challenges posed by environmental variability via beneficial shifts in morphology, behavior, or physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cridge et al., 2015</xref>). Polyphenism is commonly observed in many insect species, for examples: the solitary and gregarious phases of <italic>Locusta migratoria</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ma et al., 2011</xref>), the short-winged and long-winged morph of <italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 2015</xref>), the wingless and winged aphid of <italic>Acyrthosiphon pisum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vellichirammal et al., 2017</xref>), and the catkin and twig morphs in caterpillars of the moth <italic>Nemoria arizonaria</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Simpson et al., 2011</xref>). With the global climate problems are increasingly prominent, the study of insect polyphenism has become a new hotspot in insect ecology, epigenetics and developmental biology.</p><p>Pear psylla is a serious pest of pear trees worldwide, including <italic>Cacopsylla chinensis</italic> (Yang &amp; Li), <italic>Psylla Betulaefoliae</italic>, <italic>Psylla Pyri</italic>, and so on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Butt and Stuart, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wei et al., 2020</xref>. <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, belongs to Hemiptera: Psyllidae, which exclusively feeds on pear trees, harms the young shoots and leaves with adult and nymph, and secretes a large amount of honey dew to breed coal pollution bacteria of <italic>Gloeodes pomigena</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wei et al., 2020</xref>). It is also an important vector of the destructive disease of pear trees, <italic>Erwinia amovora</italic>, and currently one of the key pests in the major pear production areas in many East Asian countries, including China and Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hildebrand et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ge et al., 2019</xref>). In most pear production areas of China, the summer-form of <italic>C. chinensis</italic> are usually present from April to September, whereas winter-form of <italic>C. chinensis</italic> are present during the rest of the year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wei et al., 2020</xref>). The summer-form has lighter body color and stronger activity ability, and causes more serious damage compare with winter-form. For better adapt to the harsh environmental conditions, the eggs of summer-form develop to the winter-form before the pear fallen leaves. The winter-form has brown to dark brown body color and larger body size, but has the weaker activity ability and stronger resistance ability compare with summer-form. With the gradual increase of temperature in early spring, the winter-form lays eggs at the tender buds of pear trees and then develop into summer-form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tougeron et al., 2021</xref>). Hence, the transition between summer-form and winter-form is a significant ecological strategy for <italic>C. chinensis</italic> to avoid adverse environmental conditions and then burst into disaster, which has prominence biological and ecological significance. The seasonal polyphenism of summer-form and winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic> has been recognized for many years and could be induced by low temperature and short day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oldfield, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tougeron et al., 2021</xref>), but until recently no molecular mechanism had been advanced.</p><p>Temperature is a significant factor limiting the geographic ranges of species, which determines the distribution and diffusion area of species. As a type of small poikilothermic animal, insect is sensitive to temperature changes and temperature stress response is one of the most conservative mechanism to resist extreme environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Teets et al., 2023</xref>). Different environmental conditions affect the polyphenism of many kinds of insects, for examples, wing dimorphism of Hemiptera <italic>Schizaphis graminum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">An et al., 2012</xref>), diapause of Lepidoptera <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tsuchiya et al., 2021</xref>) and Coleoptera <italic>Colaphellus bowringi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guo et al., 2021</xref>). Under the low temperature conditions, insects can improve cold tolerance by regulating their internal energy metabolism and external exoskeleton system. Such as: darken their cuticles with melanin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fedorka et al., 2013</xref>), thickened wax layer or chorion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kreß et al., 2016</xref>), and store more lipids to increase energy supply and increase the accumulation of antifreeze protective substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Terblanche et al., 2011</xref>). However, studies about how insect temperature receptor response to temperature change and then activates the downstream signal molecules to regulate the polyphenism have been very limited.</p><p>Transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family gene was firstly found in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Minke et al., 1975</xref>). The TRP channel genes involved in temperature sensing are called ‘thermo-sensitive TRP’ or ‘temperature receptor’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2005</xref>). In mammals, there are six thermo-sensitive TRP receptor genes, of which TRPV1-4 mainly feel moderate high temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Venkatachalam and Montell, 2007</xref>) and TRPM8 can be activated by low temperature (8°C–28°C) or cooling substances, such as menthol and borneol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Peier et al., 2002</xref>). The activation mode is mainly due to the depolarization of cell membrane caused by the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McKemy et al., 2002</xref>). Presently, researches on the function of temperature receptor gene TRP were mainly focused on some model insects, but very few on the agricultural pests. For example, <italic>D. melanogaster TRPM</italic> is highly expressed in dendritic sensory neurons and can sense cold stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Turner et al., 2016</xref>). In <italic>B. mori</italic>, high temperature receptor <italic>BmTRPA1</italic> regulates the diapause of offspring eggs by acting on the neuroendocrine hormone signal of GABAergic-GnRH/Crz-DH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sato et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tsuchiya et al., 2021</xref>). However, studies on agricultural insects, such as <italic>Apolygus lucorum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fu et al., 2016</xref>), <italic>N. lugens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2021b</xref>), <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dai et al., 2018</xref>), and <italic>Tuta absoluta</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2021a</xref>), also only focused on the identification of the related temperature receptor gene TRPs and its correlation with temperature, no detailed molecular mechanism were reported. In agricultural insects, members of TRPA subfamily are mainly responsible for answering the high-temperature stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tracey et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Neely et al., 2011</xref>), while members of TRPM subfamily are mainly involved in low-temperature stimulation as temperature receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rosenzweig et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Turner et al., 2016</xref>). Temperature significantly affected the annual generations, adult survival rate, hibernation period, and egg laying period of <italic>C. chinensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Butt and Stuart, 1986</xref>). Our preliminary research results found that low temperature is the key factor to induce the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>. Therefore, we speculated that <italic>TRPM</italic>, functions as a temperature receptor gene, may participate in the transition from summer-form to winter-form in response to low temperature, but the specific molecular mechanism needs to be further explored.</p><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of non-coding RNA molecules, were encoded by endogenous genes in a length of about 18–25 nt. They mainly regulate many life processes, including cell differentiation, organ development, cell apoptosis, biological rhythm and metamorphosis development in animals and plants at the post-transcriptional level by inhibiting the translation process of target genes or degrading the mRNA of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asgari, 2013</xref>). In recent years, more and more studies reported that miRNAs are involved in regulating the insect polymorphism, such as the caste differentiation of honeybees, the phenotypic plasticity of <italic>L. migratoria</italic> and the wing pleomorphism of <italic>N. lugens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ye et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, miRNAs also play important roles in insect adaptation to temperature stress. For examples, miR-7 and miR-8 involved in the process of temperature adaptation of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kennell et al., 2012</xref>). MiRNAs were also found in responding to low temperature stress in rice water weevil (<italic>Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus</italic>) and gall midge (<italic>Epiblema Scudderiana</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lyons et al., 2015</xref>). There were also reported that miR-204 targeted <italic>TRPM3</italic> to regulate mammalian eye development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shiels, 2020</xref>), and miR-135a targeted <italic>TRPC1</italic> to participate in podocyte injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yang et al., 2017a</xref>). Here, we screened and validated miR-252, a miRNA whose expression was down-regulated under low temperature, negatively targeted <italic>CcTRPM</italic> to modulate the transition from summer-form to winter-form by acting on the cuticle thickness and cuticle chitin content. Chitin biosynthesis signal was also proved to involve in the transition from summer-form to winter-summer in response to <italic>CcTRPM</italic> and miR-252. Our work not only promotes the comprehensive understanding of the adaptation mechanism for <italic>C. chinensis</italic> outbreak at the physiological and ecological level as well as the insect polymorphism, but also helpful in identifying potential target genes in pest control through blocking temperature adaptation of pests.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Low temperature induced the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic></title><p><italic>C. chinensis</italic> was displayed as seasonal polyphenism along with seasonal changes: the summer-form and the winter-form. The significant differences in morphological characteristics are as following: (1) Eggs are long oval shape with a thin tip and a blunt end.

In recent years, studies on insect polyphenism have mainly focused on the molecular regulation by endocrine hormones, neuropeptides, and neurotransmitters, while the regulation mechanism by external environmental factors remains poorly understood. For examples, ecdysone signaling and insulin/IGF signaling pathway regulated the wing polyphenism of pea aphid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vellichirammal et al., 2017</xref>) or planthoppers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>), neuropeptide F was essential for shaping locomotor plasticity in locust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hou et al., 2017</xref>), and dopamine metabolic pathway modulated the behavioral phase changes of the migratory locust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ma et al., 2011</xref>). Temperature is important in defining the distribution of insects, but how it activates the temperature receptor and then regulates polyphenism need further deeply study. Here, we firstly demonstrated that the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic> was ‘temperature-dependent pattern’, and low temperature of 10 °C completely induced this transition. Just like people wear more clothes in the winter, we also proved that 10 °C induced the summer-form change to winter-form by increasing the cuticle thickness and cuticle chitin content. Several similar phenotype changes have been reported in other insects: the cricket of <italic>Allonemobius socius</italic> exhibited darker cuticles to improve thermo-regulation in colder environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fedorka et al., 2013</xref>), the mosquito of <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> increased the thickness of the egg middle serosa cuticle and wax layer as an adaptation strategy for cold acclimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kreß et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>TRPM8, a member of the TRP family, has been reported as the principal sensor of environmental cold in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Peier et al., 2002</xref>). As a kind of poikilothermic animals, insects also have an evolutionarily conserved TRPM gene which is homologous to mammalian temperature receptor of TRPM8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Venkatachalam and Montell, 2007</xref>). In this study, we identified a classical TRPM gene in <italic>C. chinensis</italic> which was designated as <italic>CcTRPM</italic> and functioned as a low temperature receptor by using qRT-PCR and calcium imaging. After knockdown of <italic>CcTRPM</italic> by feeding dsCcTRPM, the treated nymphs displayed thinner cuticle thickness and less cuticle chitin content compared with the control of dsEGFP treatment under 10 °C condition. In addition, <italic>CcTRPM</italic> knockdown by RNAi or <italic>CcTRPM</italic> antagonist feeding both caused obvious defect of the transition percent from summer-form to winter-form, but this defect could be partially rescued by a cooling agent menthol treatment. To exclude the developmental defect or genetic background, we also knocked down <italic>CcTRPM</italic> under 25 °C condition, and not found any death defect and cuticle defect. These results were the first report about <italic>CcTRPM</italic> was essential for insect polyphenism in response to low temperature. Until now, the researches about TRPM on other agricultural insects only focused on the description of its correlation with temperature, but no deeply molecular function was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2021b</xref>). Therefore, the molecular regulation mechanism of <italic>CcTRPM</italic> in response to low temperature needs further study. TRPV ion channel has been reported to function as a heat-activated receptor in mammals by David Julius (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caterina et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cao et al., 2013</xref>). So, TRPV is supposed to function as a heat-activated receptor in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, and it is also worthy to explore whether it induces the transition from winter-form to summer-form in the future.</p><p>miRNAs played significant roles in insect polyphenism and cold acclimation. For example, miR-34 and miR-9b mediated the wing dimorphism of <italic>N. lugens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ye et al., 2019</xref>) and <italic>A. citricidus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shang et al., 2020</xref>), miR-133 inhibited behavioral aggregation by controlling dopamine synthesis in <italic>L. migratoria</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2014</xref>), and miR-31–5 p via asc-C9 to regulate cold acclimation in <italic>Monochamus alternatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we demonstrated that a key regulator, miR-252, targets <italic>CcTRPM</italic> via a negative feedback loop to control the transition from summer-form to winter-form in response to low temperature. Interestingly, RNAi-mediated knockdown of <italic>CcTRPM</italic> also decreased the expression of miR-252. This result implied that up-regulation of <italic>CcTRPM</italic> in response to low temperature may be have a feedback to miR-252, then miR-252 inhibits the expression of <italic>CcTRPM</italic> under low temperature condition to avoid its excessive expression. Upon miR-252 agomir feeding, the treated nymphs showed thinner cuticle thickness and less cuticle chitin content compared with the control of agomir-NC feeding under 10 °C condition. Besides, miR-252 antagomir feeding could rescue the transition percent defect and morphological phenotype defect caused by <italic>CcTRPM</italic> knockdown. These results were the first report about miR-252 functions as the up-stream regulator to control the transition from summer-form to winter-form in response to low temperature via acting on the insect cuticle thickness and cuticle chitin content. Similar result was reported in <italic>Daphnia pulex</italic>, miR-252 might increase cadmium tolerance by switching cellular growth and cuticle protein pathways to detoxification processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). In <italic>Leptinotarsa decemlineata</italic>, 42 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified following cold exposure including miR-9a-3p, miR-210–3 p, miR-276–5 p and miR-277–3 p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morin et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, the regulatory network of miRNAs is need further investigating in the transition between two phases in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, especially transboundary miRNAs from host plant.</p><p>Insect cuticle serves as a protective barrier and plays significant roles in supporting the body, resisting the adverse environmental conditions, preventing predators from predation, and preventing pathogens from invading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Evans and Sanson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vargas et al., 2014</xref>). Chitin as an extremely important structural component of insects and represents up to 60% of the dry weight in some species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Richards, 1978</xref>). Many studies have reported that insect cuticles are essential for cold acclimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fedorka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kreß et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, cuticle thickness and cuticle chitin content were the major differences between summer-form and winter-form. We have demonstrated that <italic>CcTRPM</italic> and miR-252 function as the up-stream signaling to mediate the transition from summer-form to winter-form in response to low temperature via affecting the cuticle thickness and cuticle chitin content. Therefore, it is necessary to study whether chitin biosynthesis pathway acting as the down-stream signaling in this transition. The de novo biosynthesis of chitin has eight enzymatic steps, including 1 Trehalose, 2 enzymes in Glycolysis, 4 enzymes in Hexosamine pathway, and 1 Chitin synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doucet and Retnakaran, 2012</xref>). Further RNAi results showed that two rate-limiting enzyme genes, <italic>CcTre1</italic> and <italic>CcCHS1</italic>, play essential roles in the transition from summer-form to winter-form in response to low temperature and affect the cuticle thickness and cuticle chitin content. Glycolysis and hexosamine pathway are two complex cellular metabolic processes within organisms. We supposed that there are two reasons for not all of these steps were required: (1) the function of some enzymes may be replaced or supplemented by other enzymes, for examples, function of hexokinase and glucokinase was similar. (2) The reason for no obviously phenotypic defects might be cause by insufficient interference efficiency of RNAi. So, it’s worth to further study the functions of these chitin biosynthesis enzymes by CRISPR-Cas9 in future. In addition, <italic>CcTRPM</italic> knockdown and miR-252 agomir feeding both markedly decreased the mRNA expression of <italic>CcTre1</italic> and <italic>CcCHS1</italic>. These results proved our hypothesis and were the first report that chitin biosynthesis pathway functions as the down-stream signaling to control the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>.</p><p>In summary, this study reported a novel signaling pathway of low temperature-miR-252-<italic>CcTRPM</italic> acting on cuticle chitin biosynthesis genes to mediate the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>.

Then, <italic>CcTRPM</italic> obviously improved the expression of two rate-limiting enzyme genes from cuticle chitin biosynthesis pathway, <italic>CcTre1</italic> and <italic>CcCHS1</italic>, to increase cuticle thickness and raise cuticle chitin content. Lastly, the 1st instar nymphs of summer-form developed to 3rd instar nymphs of winter-form as an ecological adaptation strategy under low temperature stress.

While the authors explore many components of this transition, the central hypotheses they seek to test are (i) that a protein they deem CcTRPM is a cold-sensitive Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin (TRPM) channel, and (ii) that this channel is involved in the summer-to-winter transition, in response to cold.</p><p>The authors demonstrate that: both cold and menthol can initiate the summer-to-winter transition; that the protein of interest is required for the summer-to-winter transition (in vivo); that the protein of interest is involved in menthol- and cold-dependent Ca2+ transients (in vitro); that miR-252 expression is temperature-dependent, modulates the seasonal transition, and affects the expression of the transcript of interest; and finally, somewhat separately, that the chitin biosynthesis pathway is linked to the summer-to-winter transition.</p><p>However, I note three weaknesses, which are largely inherited from the original manuscript.</p><p>Firstly, the identification of the TRPM gene seems to be partially couched in the ab initio structural identification of &quot;conserved ankyrin repeats.&quot; The methodology used to identify these so-called ankyrin repeats is not sufficiently described, and their conserved status is not sufficiently demonstrated nor cited (to my knowledge, this would be the first description of ankyrin repeats in TRPM, whereas previous studies have not detected them). There is also no discussion of previously identified structural components of TRPMs (see: Yin et al 2018, DOI: 10.1126/science.aan4325)</p><p>Secondly, the phylogenetic analysis still appears to be incomplete. The authors claim that &quot;insects TRPM and mammals TRPM belong to different branches in evolution.&quot; While this is not a paper centered on the evolutionary analysis of this gene/protein family, the phylogenetic analysis here is insufficient for justifying this claim, especially since this claim is counter to previous studies (many in the literature over the past 10 years).</p><p>Thirdly, the methods lack sufficient detail to completely reproduce the phylogenetics and the cold-induced Ca2+ imaging.</p><p>Despite these weaknesses, I find the organismal/molecular component of this manuscript to be clear and convincing.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88744.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The pear psylla Cacopsylla chinensis has two morphologically different forms, winter- and summer-forms depending on the temperatures.

These comments are all of great important and extremely helpful for revising and improving our manuscript. We have revised the manuscript carefully according to all your comments. Our point-by-point responses to the comments are listed below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>1. If the authors wish to improve their phylogenetic analysis, I strongly suggest using their hemipteran sequences alongside the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog and at least all of the human paralogs. This should be generally sufficient to recapitulate the generally accepted TRPM phylogeny. If the authors contend that this is in fact a separate lineage from other insect TRPMs, a phylogeny that is as taxonomically inclusive as possible, and as methodologically rigorous as possible, would be ideal.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your great suggestion. We have redid the phylogenetic analysis in Figure S1B using CcTRPM sequence with homologs from other 16 species, including 8 human paralogs, 1 <italic>Mus musculus</italic> homolog, 1 <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog, and 6 insect homologs. The relative description was added in Line 489-491 and Line 1044-1049 of our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. If the authors wish to conclude that this is a cold-sensitive ion channel, I strongly suggest repeating at least the Ca2+ imaging with a cold stimulus. In the absence of this experiment, I think that the conclusions need to be significantly softened/hedged, making it clear that the only evidence of cold sensitivity is indirect (resulting from the knockdown experiments).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your excellent suggestion. We have performed Ca2+ imaging with a cold stimulus of 10°C. As expected, there was a clear increase of Ca2+ concentration was observed when treated with cold stimulus of 10°C, which was similar with menthol treatment. So, we could get the solid conclusion that CcTRPM is a direct cold-sensitive ion channel in C. chinensis. We also have added the Ca2+ imaging result with a cold stimulus of 10°C in Figure 2D and moved the results of Ca2+ imaging with menthol treatment to Figure S2I. The related results and methods were added in Line 193-200, Line 919-923, and Line 1065-1069 of our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Lines 173 and 181: The method used to identify the putative transmembrane domains was not described (although the 3D model does have the correct TRP structure, these methodological details would be appreciated).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your great suggestion. We used an online software of SMART (a Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool) to identify the putative transmembrane domains of CcTRPM, and have added these methodological details in Line 485-487 of Materials and Methods of our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Lines 176-178: The authors state that &quot;phylogenetic analysis revealed that CcTRPM was most closely related to the DcTRPM homologue (Diaphorina citri, XP_017299512.2), which was consistent with the evolutionary relationships predicted from the multiple alignment of amino acid sequences.&quot; The meaning of this sentence is unclear to me. I'm not sure what it means to be &quot;consistent with the evolutionary relationships predicted from the multiple alignment of amino acid sequences.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your excellent suggestion. We have revised this sentence in Line176 to 179 of our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Lines 474-475: The authors state that the NCBI database was used to identify homologous sequences, but there isn't sufficient methodological detail to repeat the search. For example, was this a BLASTP search? Was it taxonomically restricted? What statistical thresholds for homology inference were used? These details would be much appreciated.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your great suggestion. We used BLASTP of NCBI database to identify homologous sequences and preferred the representative species that TRPM sequences have been reported. We have added more description about the methodological detail of phylogenetic analysis in Line 489 to 491 of our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. It would be very interesting, but not critical, to know if menthol and borneol alone have an effect on cuticle thickness.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your excellent suggestion. Actually, we performed the experiments of menthol and borneol alone on cuticle thickness at the beginning. Under 25°C condition, treatment of menthol and borneol alone induced 30-40% transition of 1st instar nymphs from summer-form to winter-form, but only had some slight effect on cuticle thickness, not strong as 10°C of low temperature, because of the opposite effect of 25°C. However, under 10°C condition, we could not know whether the effect on cuticle thickness is from 10°C of low temperature, or direct from menthol and borneol alone.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. It would be interesting, but not critical, to confirm the authors' ab initio protein folding by comparing their model to the AlphaFold2-derived model, either by folding it themselves or extracting it from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database, if it has already been folded by DeepMind.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your great suggestion. We have predicted the tertiary protein structures of CcTRPM with AlphaFold2 software and the result was shown in Author response image 1. Compared with the result in Figure 2A, the conserved ankyrin repeats (ANK) and six transmembrane domains were almost similar.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>The tertiary structures of CcTRPM predicted with AlphaFold2 software.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-88744-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Figures 1F-G, 3F, 4A-B, 5G-J, S6C, and S7C-D do not plot replicates (although these are plotted in other figures).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your excellent suggestion. Besides Figure 1F-G was stacked grouped graph type and could not add the plot replicates, we have added the plot replicates in Figures 3F, 4A-B, 5G-J, S6C, and S7C-D of our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Figure 5A-C, and associated text: The significance of these findings is somewhat lost on me, coming from a position of general naivety concerning chitin biosynthesis. My interpretation of Figure 5A was that each of these steps was a necessary component of chitin biosynthesis. It was thus surprising that not all of the steps were required. I think it would be exceptionally helpful if the authors spent more time describing this pathway, alternative pathways to generating the intermediate steps, and ultimately, their hypothesis of why only two steps seem critical.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your great suggestion. The signal pathway of chitin biosynthesis in Figure 5A was modified from the paper of Doucet and Retnakaran, 2012. De novo biosynthesis of chitin has eight enzymatic steps, including 1 Trehalose, 2 enzymes in Glycolysis, 4 enzymes in Hexosamine pathway, and 1 Chitin synthesis. Glycolysis and hexosamine pathway are two complex cellular metabolic processes within organisms. We supposed that there are two reasons for not all of these steps were required: (1) the function of some enzymes may be replaced or supplemented by other enzymes, for examples, function of hexokinase and glucokinase was similar. (2) The reason for no obviously phenotypic defects might be cause by insufficient interference efficiency of RNAi. So, it’s worth to further study the functions of these chitin biosynthesis enzymes by CRISPR-Cas9 in future. We have added more describing about this chitin biosynthesis pathway in Line 379-390 of our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>1. Line 19, should be morphological transition.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your excellent suggestion. We have changed “behavioral transition” to “morphological transition” in Line 19 of our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Line 21, delete the novel.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your excellent suggestion. We have deleted the word of “novel” in Line 21 of our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fig. 2B, did authors examine the CcTRPM expression level before 3 d? Given that CcTRPM acts as a cold sensor, it is supposed to respond to temperature change quickly.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your excellent suggestion. We have examined the CcTRPM expression level in 1 d and 2 d after 10°C treatment compared with 25°C treatment. As expected, CcTRPM expression levels were also obviously increased in 1 d and 2 d after 10°C treatment. We have added the relative results in Figure S2F and relative description in Line 184-185, Line 500, and Line 1059-1060 of our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fig. 2I, from the figure legend and the text in the panel, it's hard for readers to understand what the authors intend to say. This data is important since knockdown of CcTRPM decreases the winter-form from 90% to 30% at 10℃. Provide more information in the figure legend.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your excellent suggestion. We have added more information in the figure legend of Figure 2I in Line 933-939 of our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Line 224, ...CcTRPM functions as a molecular switch to modulate the transition from .... The phrase 'molecular switch' is inappropriate because knockdown of CcTRPM partially decreases the form ratio as shown in Fig.2I instead of reversing the effect completely. So, use other words instead of 'molecular switch'.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your excellent suggestion. We have changed “a molecular switch” to “an essential molecular signal” in Line 225 of our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fig. 4G, this data is important. It's nice to see that this data is provided.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your excellent suggestion. We have provided the data of Figure 4G in Table S2 of our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Authors showed that CcTRPM functions as a cold receptor to regulate the transition of C. chinensis from summer-form to winter-form. Does this mean that a heat receptor gene functions oppositely by transiting winter-form into summer-form? Did the authors test the function of a heat TRP in the form transition? At least, discuss this in the discussion part.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your excellent suggestion. TRPV ion channel has been reported to function as a heat receptor in mammals by David Julius (Caterina et al., 1997; Cao et al., 2013). So, we supposed TRPV maybe function as a heat receptor to induce the transition from winter-form to summer-form in C. chinensis. The relative tests are on going. We have added two references in Line 681-686 and some discussion about the heat receptor in Line 341-345 of our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Line 433, which tissue was used for transmission electron microscopy?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your excellent suggestion. The thorax was used for transmission electron microscopy, and we have added the information in Line 448 and Line 453 of our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. How is the conservation of miR-252? Does the regulatory role of CcTRPM and miR-252 apply to the psylla family in addition to C. chinensis?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your excellent suggestion. Besides C. chinensis, the phenomenon of summer-form and winter-form also existed in other psylla species, like Cyamophila willieti. Because of no genomic information was reported in most psylla species, we could not evaluate the conservation of miR-252 between different psylla species. However, it is worth and interesting to clarify whether the function of TRPM and miR-252 were conserved in the future.</p></body></sub-article></article>
